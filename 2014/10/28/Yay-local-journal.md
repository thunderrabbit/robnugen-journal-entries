Here's a new recommendation for journaling: be able to journal anytime.  Until wifi is free everywhere I go, web-based journaling software just won't suffice.  Gotta have a book or in this case a laptop that I carry around.  Otherwise I lose countless moments to the lack of internet connectivity.

Today I went to JB for training on Wednesday morning lessons starting next week.  I'm a bit nervous (?) teaching classes in a style I've never taught before: 15 or 20 kids, 5 year old!

wut.

And actually there's a similarly sized class of 4 year old students.

Into what kind of madness am I getting myself?

I figure I need to treat it like when I broke out of my shell at University of Houston.  I was like, "fuckit I'm going to talk to people and do things."  In this case it's "fuckit, I'm going to act like I know how to act around kids!"
