Boom.  Got me what might be my new journal for a long time to come, if I can figure out how to make the directory structure the way I want, and ifff I can figure out a way to put images in here that is fast and friendly and all that.

I -*might*- attempt to write a thingy in Haskell to do it.

For now, I just need to set up a way to serve this from Dreamhost.
