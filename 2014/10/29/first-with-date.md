##23:20 Wednesday 29 October 2014##

Been working on hakyll.robnugen.com all day, and it seems I have a
framework with which I may be happy for a while.  I've essentially
finished the first three of the items from [Journal
Plans](http://hakyll.robnugen.com/2014/10/28/Journal-plans/), although
I've just realized that while that link works, the link to that entry
from my index does not (due to capitalization).  Once I fix the index
link, this link won't work unless I remember.

I've almost got [Abizern's hakyll.el](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abizern/prelude/master/personal/hakyll.el) file adapted for use in this new framework.

But for now it's bedtime.
