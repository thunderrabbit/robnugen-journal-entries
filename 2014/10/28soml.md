The very best thing about not using Wordpress or Hoken: I can repeat filenames and not have the URLs get mangled.

#State of My Life Address#

1. I ain't journaled consistently for a long time.

2. I hope to become more consistent for years to come.

3. THis SOML might get cut short, though; Lin is about to arrive in 8 minutes.

4. Lin and I are married, living in Kawasaki, Japan.  We live in a two story house (paying rent, moe joe, but it's more space and less rent than our apartment was) and her mom lives downstairs.

5. We have two cats, Ted and Jennie.  Lin named Ted, and I named Jennie after Jennifer, who found a place for Spot to live after I left the US for Japan.

6. I have vaguely good ability to understand basic spoken Japanese, but am losing my ability to speak Japanese.  I've been here 11+ years and it's starting to get embarrassing, but it just proves how lazy I am and how easy it is to live in a bubble here.

7. I've been going around barefoot as much as possible for the last two years.  I'm barefoot now, sitting in Kawasaki station as I wait for Lin to arrive.

8. Lin has just told me she'll be working for HJ starting in January.

9. I've not worked full time in a while.  I stopped working at Accent after pissing off the boss at the other Accent by allegedly sexually harassing an employee, but really it was in jest and not meant in any kind of sexy way.

10. I've been enjoying being a ~~lazy bum~~ er house husband, though I'm working a bit here and there.

11. TJ Bike and I still ride around a bit, but his chain is rusty.  I often ride Lin's bike just because it's lighter.

12. We've considered taking some long rides; we rode to her friend Mika's house a month ago or so ago, and planned to ride to Paola's after that, and Sourou's after that, and then an overnight adventure after that, but havne't done anything beyond riding to Mika's.

13. I plan to attend the next Tokyo ET communication night thing on 22 November.  Find the meetup group if you're interested, but please understand that on the first time, you won't be meeting ET close encounters style.  Might see some twinkling lights or whatnot.  (That's what I expect, but I probably need to drop even that expectiaton)

14. Tariq and I have teamed up with Christina in New York (I was just kidding when I called her *The Christina* a couple days ago) who does social network stuff.

15. We've got three apps ready to release, but want to build up some excitement first.  I'm super excited, but not sure if anything is really going to happen.  I'll let you know.

16. In the cat+computer room, Lin put down some 1/2 inch foam rubber flooring. which the cats love to claw.  It's proving to be an excellent investment in keeping their claws off the walls!

17. I've got four mazes queued up for [A Maze a Week](http://www.amazeaweek.net/), but one is scheduled to go out tonight.

18. I just fixed the tab key on my keyboard.  It had gotten sticky and didn't travel quickly each time I pressed it.

19. My computer is "Silver Monkey", a Macbook Pro about 2.5 years old.  I think it has a 15" monitor.  It's running Yosemite (OS X 10.10)

20. I've been so anti-impressed with Apple for the past 2.25 years that I am sure I'll not buy another Mac with my own monies.   When this one starts to get tired of the OS upgrades, I'll switch to Ubuntu.

21. My phone is "Little Blue Monkey", an iPhone 4S with iOS 7.1.
