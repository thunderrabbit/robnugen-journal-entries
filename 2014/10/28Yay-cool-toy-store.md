On the way to lesson with Mutsumi and Mutsumi, there's a Lotus dealership.  I used to have a Lotus, *cough* hotwheels *cough*, and it didn't last more than a year, so I don't think I'll need another.  But today I walked to that side of the street and took a picture of cars in the showroom.

Continued on that side of the street and found a cool toy shop!  Sweet stuff including a very difficult marble track "puzzle" (not quite the right word) which I could make, given the right tools.  It's on sale for several dollars.  Like it's custom made or something.

They also had a product they called "Dancing Sand" which is 98% sand and 2% some non-sticky shit that makes the sand not quite stick together. Makes cleanup a breeeeeze.

I'll go back to that shop when I have more time.
