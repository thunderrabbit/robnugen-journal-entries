During my lesson with Mogi-san, I got a call from AB saying their image system wasn't working.  Hmmm.  I asked them to create a ticket and she was like "okay" while I sent a quick email to Alfonzo because he's the one who deals with the image system.

    _______ says she can't upload images.

    I haven’t confirmed; I’m in a lesson.

    I aksed her to make a redmine ticket, but she can’t select you as the Assignee.


The ticket came through, but it was on the wrong tracker!!  wth?

I really had a brainfarzzled moment where I thought I was dreaming or taking crazy pills!

Oh, the other tracker is for another client who is also using the same image system.  Shit. I guess it's really broken.  I hope it's an easy fix.
