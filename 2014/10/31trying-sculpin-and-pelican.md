Travis suggested it might be a bit challenging to add pagination and the calendar indices that I want in my journal, and he told me about Pelican in Python and I found Sculpin in PHP.

I've installed both of those with the hope that they could just use the same markdown files as my Hakyll site, but they each have slightly different requirements for the meta data.

Pelican looks a bit closer to what I want, but the installation suddenly broke though I don't remember doing anything that should break it.  I'll reinstall it and see about writing a thing to tweak the meta data on each markdown file.
