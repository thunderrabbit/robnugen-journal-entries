Things to do related to this Hakyll static site:

1. Make sure I'm not being charged for my micro instance on AWS.  If I am, then consider using Jekyll on DH.

7. Finish the git-based hook system for posting my journal online via git pushes.

9. Tweak the site generation code so the URLs include the date, and so the files themselves are organized in directories by date.  I don't want a bajillion files in one giant /posts directory (or even 100)

5. Write a macro(?) for SublimeText2 to create journal entry files.  Basically it will use the local date as default, then I'll give it a title and it will create the file with date-based path/name + title.markdown and then put the title in the meta data for the file and put the date as the top line (and a 'written date' if I didn't use the default date of NOW)

13. Add tags

8. Figure out how to put images in this format.   Egad.  That's what pushed me off my Perl based version in the first place.

1. Use an importer for Jekyll to import my Wordpress journal entries into this format (unless there's one written for Hakyll, but they're pretty much the same format.)

2. Import journal entries from my old school journal indexed with the cgi script Fred and I wrote in Perl back in the day.

3. Import journal entries (and images) from the hoken blog thing.  (That might take way longer but we'll see if I can do it quickly based on how easily I can do the others.)

4. Leave those journals intact just for posterity.

6. Register SublimeText2

10. Tweak the CSS of the site to make it kewl.

14. Add comments (via Disqus or its rival probably)

11. Optionally, expand this site to include stuff like my old writings, from Feel Good Net to Wild Skating Adventures to various travel stories from my essentially defunct email list.Oh, and all the TIMES, ITEMS, PEEPS, etc stuff off my wiki, but leaving all the art related stuff.

15. Start moving other junk off my old provider (Dreamhost, you've been a great workhorse for many years; thank you.  I'm sure we'll be in touch.)

I'm not sure yet about one thing, though: what to call the domain during the transition.  I'm thinking it will be new.robnugen.com to start, but I don't totally like it.  I could buy a new domain and let fly2.nu fly away, or one of the others I've not really used.  Hmmm.

The dark version is DarkFox's original CSS:
