Great day at a park near Yoga station, though I've forgotten its name.

Travis and I played frisbee, and were joined by some young kids,
pretty much all of whom could throw better than I would expect given
their apparent ages.

I took a picture of Lin in front of a mimosa tree.

Yumi took some high speed video with her phone and it was fun watching them in slow motion.
