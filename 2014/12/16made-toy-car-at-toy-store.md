Went to the toy store in Harajuku and made two cars (but only photographed one)

The car pictured was made with some plastic toys that feature magnets
which hold the pieces together.

The other car was made with plastic pieces held together with ball and
socket joints.

柴田さん was there, but she was busy with another customer.

Oh, I just remembered I went barefoot that day because it was raining pretty effectively.
