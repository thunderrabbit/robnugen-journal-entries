It wasn't really a "bitcoin lesson", but when my one (1) student
showed up fifteen (15) minutes late, I had been reading posts in
[/r/bitTippers](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitTippers) (and for the first
time published a link to my subreddit
[/r/consecutiveNaturals](https://www.reddit.com/r/consecutiveNaturals))
and Bitcoin was on my brain so I asked if she had heard of it. She
had, but didn't have access to any, so I suggested
[change tip](https://www.changetip.com/) to help her get started.

We talked about the shifting landscape of economics; her company's
biggest clients used to be banks, but they're all merging and going
bankrupt so those are no longer the gravy train they once were.
