In Minecraft, I built a frame around the four-way train station I
downloaded.  For good measure, I put a pool on top.  I loaded the pool
with squid, but they all died.  Poor squid!!

Also started working on a waterslide.

Overall, I'm trying to make a really interesting world for Fred to
visit when he visits.  Hmm also gotta buy minecraft for him for
Christmas.
