I enjoy lessons with M and M because they both do lots of homework so
we can focus on exactly what they want to do, and between lessons I
can focus on exactly what I want to do.

Before the lesson, we agreed on the schedule for February, when I'm
planning to go to Kagoshima for 2 weeks.

After the lesson, M asked me when she'll become fluent... and I told
her that she will need to practice speaking if she wants to speak
English more fluently.
