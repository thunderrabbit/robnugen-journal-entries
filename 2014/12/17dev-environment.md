Got a pretty good start on setting up local dev environment for CB
dev.  Alfonzo gave me a huge head start by sending a virtualbox image
of the environment.  I cloned the code from git repo and when I edit
locally it saves to the virtual computer.

I've gotten over the initial bewilderment of a computer running on my
computer, but it's still pretty cool.

Now just gotta make the changes and send the code to git repo so
Alfonzo can deploy (or show me how).
