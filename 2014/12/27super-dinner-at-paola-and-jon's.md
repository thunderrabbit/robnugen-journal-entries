Lin and I went to Paola's for dinner with some cool peeps including
Jas, Rob, Rio, Ryo, and Tomoko.  Ryo and Tomoko brought their rabbit,
Nana; Rio brought a box of tissues.  Rob works with Jon who had to
work a bit during the evening.

Food, of course, was amazing, and I tried amaretto for the first
time.  Pretty yummy!
