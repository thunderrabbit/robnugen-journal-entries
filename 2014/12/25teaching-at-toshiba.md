Yay! for the first time I got to have a bit of a tour in
[Toshiba Science Museum](https://toshiba-mirai-kagakukan.jp/en/) on
Christmas day.

It's actually quite interesting; they've got a couple of presentations
every half hour, at least one of which involves materials cooled with
liquid nitrogen for super conductive levitation around a small
circular track.

I hope I can get them to put Francois on the hovering block some time!
