After I said / hinted to Fred that I'd love to play Minecraft with him
on a world that I've been tweaking for months over the past couple
years, he said he knew what he wanted for Christmas.

So today, I did a big step towards buying Minecraft for Fred: update
my beneficiary bank account in the US with <del>GoLloyds</del>
<ins>GoRemit</ins>.

That way I can pay off my credit card (most of which was due to my
having bought a follower on Twitter), so I can feel less dumb about
charging MC to my MC.
