crepes

##14:00

in line for water ride
I "slept" on the ride.
Took pics of Twist Robin ride or is it Robin Twister which opened in March but is not operating now.
Lin noticed some tape on the rails, and I noticed that it marks sections of the track which don't meet smoothly. Oops!!

##19:22

battery died after I took buncha pictures so notes don't have time stamps.

Saw Joel C, CCC on 52å›ž, while in line for Bandit before dusk. Rode in last seat of last car!

Did go carts after that. I think it got dark then.

Then we did laser tag I thought but actually a variety of challenges in different rooms.

Then rode several little rides with no lines

Then ate fries then rode Ferris wheel. The Christmas lights across the park coat every shape in light.

Then rode one more small ride.

##19:27

in line for Bandit again.

##19:35

bandit was fun

##19:36

in line for Leather Atheletic but what is it?
Dunno, but it's warmer inside than outside.

##20:23

it was a set of three series of challenges. We tried and failed the C course together (approximately 20% pass rate from what I saw) and then I tried and failed the A course twice, getting past only the first challenge the first time and halfway through the fourth challenge (of five total) the second time.

##20:25

we are in line for the gondolas to go back to Keio Yomiuriland station.

##20:30
