I just got an email (that I opened!!) and noted it was sent to an
email address I entered on adobe.com

The content looks vaguely legit, but it starts to get spooky when
looking at the URL link (The TLD is .rocks)

Clicking that sends me to a sales website to get the latest doodads
from nothing related to Medicare.  Yeah, I don't think Adobe sold my
address to them.  I think Adobe got hacked.
