Spoilers ahead!!

Due to the Streisand Effect, I'm watching The Interview.  It's got
some funny parts, and some racist parts.. but isn't all that thought
provoking.

Spoilers next!!

Just finished the movie.  I was optimistic that they wouldn't kill
KJU, but they did.  The character played by
[Diana Bang](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3048983/?ref_=tt_cl_t5) was
great+funny+hot!

Some of the humor was childish; some of the violence was overdone;
KJU's death was quite graphic.

I hoped they would just leave it at him crying, not going crazy, and
not being killed.  Bah.
