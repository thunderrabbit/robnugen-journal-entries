I've seen this truck each time I come to the lessons in Fukuura:

The party was fun; lots of conversation, plus an emcee up front
leading some pre-planned competitive games, then a raffle and
bingo. People mostly stood around tables covered in drinks, candy,
snack foods, tangerines, and some more substantial food,
including 焼きそば plus おでん.

Games included a mini version of sumo wrestling, where the
participants were butt-to-butt on a chair cushion surrounded by mats.
The first person off the cushion lost; it usually took about 0.5
seconds per round! I mentioned to Ashley (the guy for whom I'm taking
over classes) that we had a much more balanced game with players
face-to-face, and only allowed to touch with hands.  He said he had
seen a similar game, possibly in Japan.

Another game was a mini drinking competition, but instead of 3 liter
bottles, or gallons of milk, they used 12 (or maybe 16) ounce cola
bottles, and instead of chugging, they sucked it up through silly
straws shaped like glasses (while wearing them).

Ping pong played with non-standard paddles (slippers, pans, bottles,
etc) seemed easy enough, but the winning team only got a volley of 14
hits (whereas one team only got 3!)

For the first 1.5 hours, Ashley and Jessica talked shop (they've
worked together for a while) and I lurked around them, admiring their
Japanese skizzles. (Man I gotta learn me some Japanese as well.)

Just arrived at 新杉田 so gotta go.

I'm on the 京浜東北線 now, and there are plennnty of seats!  That's
one really nice thing about this particular class; I can pretty much
sit down all the way both ways.

Hopefully I can snag this class on a permanent basis.  Just gotta tell
JB that I can do it.
