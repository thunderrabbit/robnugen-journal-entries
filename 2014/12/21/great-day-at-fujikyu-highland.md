##18:25 Sunday 21 December 2014 JST##

Here's the TLDR:

We've just left on our Shinjuku-bound bus.  Basically today was a
great day at Fuji-Q Highland, and based on very limited information, I
think Fujiyama may be the most popular ride in the park. It seemed to
have the longest line at any given time.

We rode big coasters eight times:

    Fujiyama * 2
    Takabisha * 2
    Dodonpa * 1
    Eejyanaika * 3

Also rode several rides on time each (capitalized if I know the (romanji) name):

    Hamu Hamu Okuri  (hanging coaster for kids)
    bicycles  (pedal powered bike on flat track)
    Mad Mouse (mousetrap coaster)
    ferris wheel
    Red Tower (drop tower)
    Tondemina (swinging frisbee)

### (end TLDR)

I took notes during the day on my phone:

##9:35##

line for Fujiyama

##10:15##

got to pass about 20 people at entrance because it's just me and Lin.

Fujiyama BACK CAR!!! (7.14285714286% chance)

Nice air time on at least three drops!

##10:25##

line for Takabisha

##11:13##

front seats! (50% chance)

It's such a lovely smooth ride!!

##11:22##

in line for Ejyanaika

##12:00##

haha I did thinking pose for the photo. It's not perfect, but pretty okay.

##12:12##

in line for Hamu Hamu Okoku, the ride which used to be called Birdman or something back until like 1997 I think

##12:29##

aww man the photo op isn't on the right

##12:33##

no line for bikes!!

##12:45##

essentially no line for 60 meter drop tower, Red Tower

##12:50##

no line for Tondemina!

Haha oops Lin didn't like it.

##13:03##

pizza now. She says good thing we ate after Tondemina instead of before!

##13:24##

in line for Mad Mouse

After a little diversion to see the haunted house line is too long, 70 mins (plus 500 yen to pay the <del>actors</del> <ins>ghosts</ins>)

##14:00##

in line for Ejyanaika. The line is a bit shorter this time!

I did the thinking face again, but it was no better than the photo we bought.

##14:30##

in line for Ejyanaika!

They are only running one train.

The first two times, we took the left entrance. This time we are waiting in the right hand entrance.

I plan to "sleep" for the photo this time.

##15:16##

sleeping photo turned out okay; Lin really seemed to like it!

##15:41##

riding in clear plexiglass car on Ferris wheel

##15:54##

in line for Dodonpa, which Lin has not yet ridden. The line doesn't even go down one entire ramp.

The first time I rode, I think the line was about two hours long.

##16:24##

in line Takabisha

##17:04##

Lin said it wasn't so scary this time.

##17:07##

in line for Fujiyama

##17:37##

looks like we are going to be in the front car! (1/14 chance)

##17:53##

so cold!!

##18:03##

in line for crepes!!

I got blueberry and Lin got chocolate. Now getting postcards.

##18:12##

in line for the bus!!


### end notes from phone

Lin prepared several bean burgers, which we ate during the day,
interspersed with snacks both from home and from the park.

I got soft serve ice cream from a a stall staffed by a woman who ws a
bit older than me.  I took a picture of the ice cream with Francois
and she mentioned that she had a real rabbit (as if Francois isn't
real!) and I asked to see the picture.  He's white and black with a
Charlie Chaplain mustache; she calls him ロロ, "Roro", which is a
shortened form of しろ+くろ

I bought two packs of Mt Fuji postcards which I plan to send to people
via Fiverr.

All in all the weekend was lovely, successful, comfortable, fun, and delicious.
