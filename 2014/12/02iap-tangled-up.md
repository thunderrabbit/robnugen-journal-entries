I'm trying to test the In-App Purchases for our new app, but for some
reason all the descriptions are off.  When I click this one it buys
that one and when I buy that one it buys the other one.  I thought I
had all this shit worked out.

Got it worked out.  Apparently Apple returns the list of products in
alphabetical order instead of by the order I list them in my code.
