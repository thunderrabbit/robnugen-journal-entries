Over the weekend I worked on expanding the four pieces to a larger project.  At this point it looks like this:

[![nine 色紙 panels with pink and green lines on each one](/images/2014/12/thumbs/without maze.png)](/images/2014/12/without maze.png)

I haven't got the maze planned exactly, but I want to draw a maze that spans the panels.  The points at which the maze goes off the edge of panels will be aligned in a way that the panels seem to fit together in multiple ways.  Here's my first draft:

It will probably take a few more hours to finish, but hopefully I can do it today.
