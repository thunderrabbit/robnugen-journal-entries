Fun party yesterday!

Interesting group games which I hadn't seen before.  Two people listen
as the remaining people (in two groups) shout in unison two similar
words, which the listeners try to understand.

So we on team A shouted COPY while team B shouted COFFEE.  The
listeners hear "KA EE" (and try to sort out what the teams were
shouting).

Other word pairs: CONVERSATION, CONSERVATION; ELEGANT, ARROGANT; WORK,
BOOK (I think; I was on the listening side of that one)..

Lots of food: pizza, sandwiches, sushi, cake, plus drinks of a variety
of varieties.
