In 45 minutes, Lin and I are heading to Shinjuku to bus to Fuji to chill and then visit Fuji-Q Highland tomorrow!  Wooooo

##13:15

As our bus was pulling out of the boarding area, Lin and I were like
"wowwww" because it's in a pretty busy shopping district.  Seemed to
be less than a meter to spare in front of the bus on the first left
turn.
