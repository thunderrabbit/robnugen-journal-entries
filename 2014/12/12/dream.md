<div class="dream">
With food still onthe table som epeople started to pull the blanket from the bed to cver it, and I kept holding it back saying wait because it would get the balnketst dirty with peach sauce and water some chicken remains; I tried picking up the food; there wasn't much left and finally they stopped and I asked for a towel to wipe up the water and then some orange juice got spiled on the bedge of the bed mattress.  Oh man so now we gotta clean that up.  Fortunatel tere was a plastic liner of holding the liquid so when I got a big towel it sopped up the liquid readily and almost none remained in the bed.  I throught it was very convenient and lucky because if someone peed in the bed, it would be a mess but someone had not so it was okay.  Allthe juice stopped up and I wen t to a dreain the the middle o  the room and  twisted the towerl to squeeze out the liquid. I dripped down into the drean, though not as much came out as I suspected.  I watched teh waer go down the drain and it was all cleaned up.

And through all of that , I didn't pee in the bed.
