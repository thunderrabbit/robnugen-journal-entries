##16:00 Wednesday 10 December 2014 JST##

1.  TLDR: I've been a lazy bum recently.  And I love it.

1. Maybe the coolest thing recently: Mutsumi introduced me to
   Funatsu-san, who liked my art and asked if she can put some in a
   show in January!

2. I've been teaching a few lessons per week with a language school,
   but other than that, doing a lot of Minecraft, and drawing a few
   mazes.  With the news above, I'm more excited to make some art!

3. Lin and I live in Kawasaki with our two cats, Ted and Jennie, who
   are currently not allowed to go outside nor sleep with us at night.
   I'd love to let them outside, but Lin agreed with the shelter that
   she will keep them inside.  We had let them sleep with us, but one
   of them urinated on Lin's comforter so they've lost their bedroom
   priveleges.

4. I'm arriving now at a train station where I need to change; I might
   forget about this entry.

5. I've just moved from AWS to DH.  Due to a blip in Dreamhost's DNS
   something something, I had to write to them to get the site
   activated; I think it's working now, and I Stopped the EC2
   instance.

1. Because I'm using markdown to mark up my journal, I don't have to
   use the actual number when creating numbered lists.

1. I'm sitting in the driver's seat of a driverless train on the
   Seaside Line, heading to 福浦.  (I guess that kanji is correct.)
   This is what driverless cars might feel like, except my insulated
   environment (in the train) is inside an insulated environment
   (elevated roadway with limited public access)

1. Hmm.  I don't see a way to make multiple paragraphs within one
   numbered section.

1. From this train, I can see a large wind turbine, which I htink is
   the same one I could see from our previous apartment (in 朝日町ハイツ)

1. Oh shit I see the line splits; I hope to goodness that I'm on the
   right track!!!  Ah, I guess that's not for public use; the line
   drawn on the map is just a straight line with no branches.

1. This is more like a stream of consiousness thing instead of a State
   of My Life.

1. I'm still using my iPHone 4S which I've had for a while. The
   battery has been draining a bit faster than I'd like.  I thought I
   had all the energy-drainers turned off, but maybe not.  Maybe the
   battery is just getting tired.  My phone number is the same one
   I've had for years in Japan.

1. Main work projects: unpaid iOS work with Tariq (though we are
   hoping for some sales with our latest set up updates)

1. Every time I use my computer for longish periods of time, my hands
   get cold.  Especially my mouse hand.  I imagine taht's a good
   reason to *not* do computer stuff for longish periods of time.  Is
   it my body's way of telling me to stop it altogether? Or shall I
   just set up a more ergonomic setup?

1. I need to convert AB's EC2 instance to two instances: one for DB
   and one for the website.  I'm guessing the DB can be behind a
   firewall; I don't know the optimal way to set it up, much less the
   optimal way to transition to that new configuration.  I'll
   basically just rtfm, and maybe some toots, and hopefully it will be
   all good.  AND I'll document the proverbial shit out of everything
   I do.

1. I've got emacs set up to create journal entries, though I don't
   have the final touches set up.  I mean I can type `C-x j` to start
   a new entry, and it will even ask for the title, tags, and let me
   overwrite the date if needed.  However, if I do overwrite the date,
   I'd like it to put the date I enter and add a note saying the
   actual date the entry was written.  I don't yet have a keystroke
   way to insert a new date in the middle of the text, but that's not
   as high priority as having entries named "dream" automagically get
   class='dream' divs wrapped around the text.  I had that kinda stuff
   set up before, but I don't know where the code may be hiding.  It
   could even be lurking around on my current local drive, but I'm not
   sure.

1. I haven't written any automated stuff to have Sublime do journal
   entries, partially because I haven't registered (paid for) Sublime
   yet (and therefore don't use it much).


1. Lin and I went to the Tokyo ET Contact group in November, and plan
   to go again in December.  I'm hoping to attend most of the
   meetings; I want to foster relations between our civilizations.  I
   want a degree in intergalactic diplomacy (or at least intergalactic
   relations)!

1. I'm scheduled to go to CPC clinic in February; not sure if I'll do
   it though.

1. Lin and I are planning to take a <del>reasonably</del>
   <ins>vaguely</ins> long bicycle ride during the new year holidays.
   No specific plans yet.

1. I need to go to 二子玉川 to get (one of) her Christmas
   present(s). (I promised her a Harrod's bear each year that we don't
   have kids.)

1. I've been using some of my free time to meditate more and maintain
   awareness of consciousness.  I haven't noticed any "amazing"
   experiences, not that conciousness itself isn't amazing.

1.  Been working with Soness a bit to help get her paperwork sorted.
    It's fun to chat with her more often than we had been for the past
    couple years.

1.  I ain't really talked with Dad in a while, nor with Ma.  Nor with
    Fred, for that matter; he and I used to talk just about every day
    for a couple months there.  I sent him a present and it's been
    chillin' at the post office in Austin (I can tell from the
    tracking website); he must be busy!  I sent him a reminder and he
    was like, "oh yeah!!"

From my perspective, at a larger scale:

27. We still live primarily in a fiat currency based system.  Some
    crypto currencies have been developed on "the blockchain"
    (Bitcoin, Litecoin, probably others), and some other similar
    currencies have been developed, my favorite being Dogecoin.

1.  We still primarily burn fossil fuels for energy.  There are
    whistleblowers online saying free energy is possible, but hidden
    from public access.

1.  We still primarily use "conventional" methods of
    transportation. There's not even a specific word that I know of to
    describe transportation not via teleportation.

1.  Extraterrestrial life has not been publicly acknowledged by (most?)
    governments.

1.  Earthquakes are officially not predictable.  Weather is not
    particularly changeable (that I know of, except by cloud seeding
    to make it rain)
