I went to an Indian restaurant for lunch today, and was enjoying
veggie curry and nan when two, ahem, people lit up cigarettes across
from me in the restaurant.

I switched to gobble mode on my curry, left 80% of the nan and put on
my jacket.

The manager was like, "oh would you like your tea?"

"No; I gotta go. You've got two fuckers here smoking and it's
disgusting. I guessed you would have no smoking during lunch, but I
was wrong. Sorry about that."

Why is smoking even a thing?
