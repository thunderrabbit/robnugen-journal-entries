I've been stopping by the toy store on the way to M&M lesson on
Tuesdays.  It's mostly kids' stuff, but they've got a few challenging
puzzles, including three linked "ring" puzzles that can be taken
apart.  I solved two of them today after having solved the third
(first?) last week.  I put together a round plastic jigsaw puzzle,
which I guess was made with a laser cutter.

I didn't think to take a picture of it.  I doubt it will be intact
next time I go back (unless they glue it together!)

When I left, the girl was like, "さよなら！" (sayonara, which means
"see ya dunno when") and I was thinking "no way, see you next week!"
