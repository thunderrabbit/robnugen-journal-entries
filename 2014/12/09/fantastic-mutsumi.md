Wow wow wow wow so great and so thankful for Mutsumi helping me so
much with my art!  She introduced me to the owner of company who deals
in fashion designs.  Word; I can dig my designs on some shirts!

She asked if I can tweak my design a bit, but it's not even really a
tweak so much as just use a fatter marker.  I can do that.

Afterward, Mutsumi walked with me to, and saw me off at M&M lesson.
Yay!
