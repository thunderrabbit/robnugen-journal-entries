We had some older kids in the kids class today. I'm not sure why they
were there, but they supported and some were enthusiastic / unafraid
to do the dance/song/etc that I presented.

The second class got cut short for some reason; basically a woman came
up and was like, "okay, please tell them thank you (and goodbye)" so I
confirmed it with the normal staff and yep, so finished up.
