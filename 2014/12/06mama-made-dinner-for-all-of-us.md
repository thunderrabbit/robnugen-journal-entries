Lin's mom made about 6 different Taiwanese dishes for a dinner party
featuring Jas, Jon, Paola, Lin, and me.  Great delicious, though a
couple were a bit spicy for me.

So funny as Jon and Jas got progressively sillier and sillier as they
poured a bottle of shochu(?) for everyone.

It was hard to keep Mama seated long enough to eat much; even Lin is
eating now as I type this after we walked everyone to the station.

On the way there I asked Jon if he knew of anyone he'd recommend for
personal investment advice.  Noop.

We stopped by Kaldi and got some chocolate (and the boys got more
beverages)

I took us through Azalea because it's warmer and we stopped by a large
array of products from Kagoshima where Jas offered everyone white
chocolate.

Hugged them off at the ticket gates and Lin and I walked home where
we're now watching "Olympus Has Fallen" which doesn't seem very
realistic.
