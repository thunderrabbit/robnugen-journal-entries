<div class="dream">
Interesting set of movies were planned at local theater:

    Planet Terror, etc

I was in back of theater and read the list of movies for the crowd, while Paola was the projectionist.

First movie had a secret menu before it started, like a master menu
for all six movies.  The top of one menu said "Planet Terror Real
Menu" and had items like, "PLAY ALL MOVIES" "EXIT" and a few others.
Selected "PLAY ALL MOVIES" then the movie started and a guy was like
hey try my app!  It will simulate me stalking you!  It will be great!

And I go "no thanks" and I wasn't sure if this was the movie, or how I
would know the difference between movie and reality, and then he was
like "oh hey I noticed your sister is getting married next week..."
And I became a character in that movie:

We were in a slow paced rural city bar, making plans for wedding, and
my sister was plannin g to get married.  She had been working at the
bar, but there were rumors that she'd no longer be able to work after
getting married for some reason; either leaving the town or becoming
full time mom; there was also some bit of scandal; I was worried about
being set up against my sister somehow due to the game on my phone.

Then I woke up
