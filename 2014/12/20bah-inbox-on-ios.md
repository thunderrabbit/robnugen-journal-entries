I wrote a message to Travis using (Google) Inbox.  Clicked the + icon
and his name was helpfully on the list of people to whom I could
write.  Bingo.  Nice!

Got a bounce: the address to which the message was composed was
Travis' *old* address! That's not helpful!  Booo Inbox for suggesting
an old address I haven't used in years for Travis.


So I tried to forward to Travis (new address) the message that I had
written to Travis (old address), but I wante d to remove the "---
Forwarded message ---" header at the top.

I don't know if it's an Inbox thing or iOS thing, but I couldn't do
it.  Not even if it was a reply.

That is some shitty UX there.  Is it supposed to be for "proof of
existence"?  "Oh look this is labeled '--- Forwarded ...' that can't
have been modified!  Nor prepended with '--- Forwarded ...'!!"
