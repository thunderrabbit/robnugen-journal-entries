I've wanted to see this movie ever since I was a little kid when it
first came out.  Tonight, we are watching it on Hulu.  (and by
watching, I mean I'm watching, and Lin's taking a shower.  She'll
sleep on the couch soon after she gets back.)

Well, it wasn't terrible, but it was definitely dated.

    It is certainly not boring, but it doesn't seem to add up to
    much. Besides a few personality quirks, the characters are not
    very clearly delineated, making it somewhat arbitrary who survives
    in the end and difficult for us to even care.

Yup.
