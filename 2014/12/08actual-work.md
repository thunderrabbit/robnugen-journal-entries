I spoke with Nate and Alfonzo yesterday about work stuff; Alfonzo has
been too busy to do it so I may get a chance to make a few extra
dollars.  The contract may be terminated though, not sure yet.  This
is for the CB project we started six years ago.  They've been on a
"maintenance" contract but asking for lots of changes.
