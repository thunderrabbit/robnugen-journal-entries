Sweet this Limited Express train is fun to ride as it whizzes past
like 7 stations between KQ Kawasaki and Yokohama (sorry, Travis).  I
might try to ride in the very front (passenger) seat next time.  It
features big windows to see out front.

To be honest, I've never really liked riding trains from KQ Kawasaki;
there are several lines which use the same set of platforms so I can't
just jump on any train that comes by.  Plus the trains range from
local (and hit every station) to limited express (and skip most
stations), so even if I'm on the right line, I might take "forever" to
get there or miss the station completely.  So I guess i'm saying I
don't like it because I have to pay attention to what I'm doing haahaah
