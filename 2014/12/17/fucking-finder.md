More than once in recent memory, Finder has hung when trying to load
images.  It responds in every other way, but simply refuses to display
the files in the Finder window where they should be displayed.  Why?

It's (fortunately) not the (SSD) drive dying; Emacs loads the list of
files immediately, but Finder just hangs.

Even Terminal displays them instantly.

And it's not like there's a million files.  In these cases, there are
six (6) and two (2) files, respectively, less than 2MB each.
