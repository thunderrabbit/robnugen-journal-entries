This place is nice and quiet; I think there may be only one other
couple here.  We had each hot spring bath to ourselves, the entire
lobby to ourselves, the entire hall to ourselves.

We took a bus from Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko, and then the hotel sent a
shuttle to shuttle us to the hotel.  The driver reeked of cigarette
smoke, and the van was equally bad.  I opened the window in the van to
breathe fresh air instead.

There's a slight problem with using the facility as a ET Contact spot;
they apparently lock the doors at 11pm each night.  Hmmm.  There's
also a bright light that was on after 11pm.  (The guy said it stays on
all night, but I just went to check and it's off (at 3am), so maybe it
goes off at midnight)

Other than the doors, now that I know the light goes off, this is a
relatively good spot, though the trees allow less than 180 degree view
of the sky.

Hmmm, looking at the video that Mark made, I am not sure if it's
exactly the same spot, but it's pretty close.
