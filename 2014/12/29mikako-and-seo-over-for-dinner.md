Mikako and Seo came over today for なべ with me, Lin, and ママ.
Jennie is here in the living area; Ted is hiding in the cat room,
though he didn't totally panic when Lin and Mika went to visit him.

Seo and I are playing
[Say Cheese](http://www.amazon.com/Popular-Playthings-HC70430-Say-Cheese/dp/B004QGW7GE).
I've solved up through level 20 in the required number of moves; he
has done most of them except the pesky level 10.

##20:10

We are headed out to see Interstellar soon.

Lin really liked the movie!  Seo liked it less than I expected.
Everyone was like, "wait but, wait, what?"

After the movie, we got to Kawasaki station at like 12:15am.  The last
train to their station had just left, but they were able to get
another train that went most of the way there.

Lin and I walked home and I tried to answer her questions ranging from
"what is a black hole" to "why did one hour out there equal 7 years on
earth?"

After my answers, I was glad Lin said, "wow! I didn't know science was
so interesting!"

At the end of our walk, Lin wondered the why of life, and how the
universe started.  Good questions!
