Mutsumi asked if I can make a pattern for her friend's mom.  Sure thing!

[![pattern](/images/2014/12/thumbs/mutsumi mom.png)](/images/2014/12/mutsumi mom.png)

It is designed to repeat seamlessly.

<div style="background-image: url('/images/2014/12/thumbs/mutsumi mom.png'); width:800px; height:800px"></div>
