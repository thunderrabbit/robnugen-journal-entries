We moved!  Our new house is great, though a bit farther from the station.  However, that gives me a chance to take a walk each morning and evening.  I allocate 30 minutes walking time each direction.  Not sure how far it actually is, but probably around 2km.  2.6km according to Google.

The key words for this house are big and nice.  Oh, and cats (surrounding).

We don't have internet connected yet, but have fiber installed in our living room!  Now my computer will be the bottleneck; that's amazing.

Yesterday I went to an electric shop looking for coaxial cable for the TV connection.  (sigh)   They only had 5m max (not nearly far enough to reach the station!!) but I needed 15 meters (routed at right angles along the edges of the room) to reach the spot where Lin wants the TV.  They said it would take a day at 9800 yen to make.  Ummmmm no thanks.

On the way home, I saw an ~~old guy~~ elderly gentleman in a shop that looked like my dad's garage.   I scoped the signs and could read enough to know he was a handyman.  I was like, "hey, uh, do you happen to have coaxial TV cable?"

He had to dig around a bit, but the short version is YES, he made 15 meters and gave it to me free.  whoooooo!!!!
