!!!!Spoilers ahead!!!!

I cried twice during Interstellar.

I was planning to cry a third time, but the movie ended too soon!

Overall, I wasn't put off by the physics.  Using gravity to move the
second hand on the watch (but not the rest of the watch) was lame, but
bearable if I replace the word "gravity" with "finger coming through
5th dimension".  The emotional parts of the movie were pretty great,
though I was sad to see Matt Damon play a "bad guy"

Seeing the time dialation stuff in action was trippy, and well done.
