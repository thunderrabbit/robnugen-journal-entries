I feel a lot more confident that I can present something fun and
enjoyable for the kindergarten classes on Wednesday!  Thanks to Soness
for sharing from her years of experience!

She agrees that
[Dream English Kis](https://www.youtube.com/user/DreamEnglishKids) is
a great resource, and said Matt is a great person for me to model
because he's got good gestures and (like me,) isn't over-the-top
exuberant (like Soness).

I will help Soness with some online stuff, and in the process
hopefully learn how I can promote my own online stuff!  Ah!  I guess I
should have a mazes section on this website!
