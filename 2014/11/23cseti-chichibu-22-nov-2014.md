##23:08 Saturday 22 November 2014 JST##

Out in the field, we did meditation, then a visualization to show the
ETs where we are located.

We saw a few falling stars, but nothing else obvious.

I'm writing now because I just came back to the cabin to get the main
laser pointer.

##02:55 Sunday 23 November 2014 JST##

We just arrived back in our cabin.  Saw lots of flashes in the sky,
like the whole sky lit up just for a twentieth or 100th of a second,
about maybe 20 times over the course of nearly 5 hours we were out
there.

Also saw many shooting stars, though not more than I might expect in a
night.

We recorded audio from the evening on my phone. I'm not sure how to
transfer it from my phone to my computer though.

Wake up time in 5.5 hours.
