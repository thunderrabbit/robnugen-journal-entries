I spent a few hours working on the 3D maze I started about a week ago.  There must be a faster way, but I don't know how exactly.  Basically for each part of the maze that goes over another part, I make that section its own layer so it can be "above" the lower layers.  Then for each part that goes under another party, I make that its own section so it can be "below" the upper layers.  But then, to paint a gradient on the lower sections, I have to split them apart again because I don't know how to make Gimp do a "double" gradient.  I don't even know what it's called (as I haven't tried to look it up).

I might remember to see if Gimp can do it before I finish this maze.  Here it is so far:
