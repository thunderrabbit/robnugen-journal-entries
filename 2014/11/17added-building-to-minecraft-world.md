And by add, I mean using MCEdit, I injected an schematic of the
[Empire State Building (unfinished) by Avalanche_Ali](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/empire-state-building/)

I placed it in the middle of a plain at first, but then thought it
would look weirder in a forest, so I put it there instead.

Beautifully, without having really tried hard, the minecart track I
had built went straight into the center of the building, aligned
perfectly. Nice.
