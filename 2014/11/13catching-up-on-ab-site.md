A request got lost in the shuffle, and I've now got it working, but
the CSS is still messed up. I got it working in Chrome, but not in
Firefox. Bah.

While making a ticket for the above request, I found an old request
intended for me but not assigned to me, so I never saw it. I got it
sorted today.
