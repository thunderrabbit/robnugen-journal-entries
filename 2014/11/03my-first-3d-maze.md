Though it's not as smooth as I had hoped, I got a maze made with my gradient on [https://www.easystereogrambuilder.com/3d-stereogram-maker.aspx](https://www.easystereogrambuilder.com/3d-stereogram-maker.aspx).

If you can't solve the stereogram, look at the [mask for the maze](/images/2014/11/gradient maze mask small.png).

I think the stereogram z-dimension curves look a lot steeper than the mask.
