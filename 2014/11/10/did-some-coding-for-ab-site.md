I'm late writing this entry, but really late with the code.  It was
around the time that I was leaving the language school in Ebisu that
AB client requested a change.  The paper on which the request was made
got moved by over-eager cleaning and I just found it on Sunday,
whereas I think I had the meeting in August.  Oh fuck.

AB has also been busy, but damn I don't want to leave shit hanging
like that.

Anyway, I got the backend changes coded up yesterday, and I think I
found an even sweeter solution than I might have in August. I got a
bit of a start on the frontend, but I still need to dig in to remember
how it all works before I can do the rest.
