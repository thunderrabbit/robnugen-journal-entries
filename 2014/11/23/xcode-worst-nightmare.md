Why why why oh why oh why why oh why

Why do all the iOS 7.1 simulators get destroyed when I install Xcode
6?  Why is there not a way to delete all the ones that don't work in
one shot?  Why does the UI require like 4 clicks all over the place to
create even a single simulator?  Why does the simulator creation allow
me to create unlimited identical simulators?

Why am I still using stupid Xcode?
