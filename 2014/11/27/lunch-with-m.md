Going to lunch with M, with whom I zip lined on Sunday.

##15:00:11

We ate at Wired Cafe on the east side of Shinagawa station, then
walked two blocks east, then south along the river, then across the
river on a blue bridge, and saw some bicycle rental place called "bike
sharing" though we'd have to pay.

Continued south on the east side of the river to a large black
metallic structure shaped like an O when viewed from the river, but
like an n when looking parallel to the river.

We talked about travel and what we'd do if we had mo money.  (Buy a
house and not live in Japan.)
