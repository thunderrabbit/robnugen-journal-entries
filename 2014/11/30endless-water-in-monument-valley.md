Monument Valley features fun puzzles and the most
unique+elegant+beautiful gameplay I've seen in an app since that one
game where we bounce around bubbles or something.

(I'd try to find a link, but I have no internet access now.)

Anyway, I think Monument Valley is worth $3.99 for any puzzle
enthusiast.
