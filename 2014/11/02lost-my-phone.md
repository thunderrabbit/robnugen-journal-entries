##11:37am Sunday 2 November 2014##

Got off the train, felt no cellphone in my front pocket!

Crap!

I turned around and (stupidly) started *angling* back toward the train
door where we had gotten off, instead of straight back to the train
and got on before the doors closed.

D'oh!

Went to the lost and found to report it.  I was like, "so where does
that train stop?" thinking they could look up that the train that left
at 11:37am and know when and where it was scheduled to stop for the
day (probably 大崎).  He was like, "it's a circle, mate."

True enough.

##13:00##

At Paola's house and called Softbank to ask them what to do.  The
rep was like, "do you want us to track it?"  Sure!  "Okay, we'll call
you back in an hour."

Great!

##14:00##

It took the better part of an hour, but Softbank called back and said
it's in Shinjuku Okubo 2 Chome, or around thereabouts.  I asked if the
phone is moving or if it's been stopped there for a while.

She was like, "we don't know, but when we called it, it was in Shinjuku Okubo 2 Chome."

(There goes my fantasy that they have giant maps with blinking lights
tracking phones around the city..)

So I go, "okay, can you call it back and see if it's still there?"

"We turned it off."

"Is there any way to turn it back on?"

"It's in Shinjuku Okubo 2 Chome."

" . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ? Umm, okay thank you very much."

wut.

##14:14##

We're going to walk to the local police box to ask them to be on the lookout.

ELI5 why the fuck would Softbank turn it off?

"so no one can make calls (can cost you a lot of money)"

Just don't charge me for the calls after I report it lost.

##15:something##

The guy at the police box was 元気 (happy/funny/helpful) and was
confident I'd get the phone back, though it might take some time.

##19:55##

After a lovely afternoon at Paola's, featuring home made Indian
cuisine, Lin and I *walked* to Shibuya station from Paola's house,
which took about 30 minutes, and brought us past Lin's old high school
and lots of other places she hadn't seen in several years.

Near 道玄坂 we saw some young men walking and brushing their teeth at
the same time.  Not sure what that was about, but I'm sure it was
either funny or cool.

Lin and I hopped on Yamanote Line and I commented that it was also on
Yamanote platform in Shibuya that I lost Francois some years ago.

We skipped one train because it only stopped in 大崎.

We got on the next train, and Lin got a call just as we arrived in 大崎.
"Did you lose a phone?", etc.

It's in 新大久保, so we're headed back now.

Now, I put "walked" in italics above because if we had taken the train
to Shibuya, we would have probably already been walking toward home in
川崎 (you can read that, right, Colleen?) which would have made it
more moe joe to go pick up the phone tonight.  Even if we had gotten
onto a train all the way to 品川 when we skipped that one train, we
might have been "too far" away to go back tonight.
