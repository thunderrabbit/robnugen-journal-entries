Thanks to Soness helping me prepare, I was well enough prepared for
the kids lesson even though I felt crazy afraid before the lesson. I
believed I wasn't prepared; I had forgotten to bring Johnny (the
stuffed bear) who I planned to use as a teaching assistant; I didn't
have a way to play music in the class, and I was just a frazzled nut
before the lesson.

I texted Soness, and she called me back immediately for support. She
got me sorted: "well, does the school have any stuffed animals you can
use?" (they did) "do they have any flashcards?" (oh yeah I had
forgotten), and just general confidence that I'd be fine.

The lessons were a bit chaotic, but everyone survived (including me)
and only a few people cried (not including me).  The second class had
23 students, so we counted to 25 in the circle (includind me and their
full time teacher), and since they did so well, I had us count up
to 50.
