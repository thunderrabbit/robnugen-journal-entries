Before the lesson started, there was an announcement on PA system.  I
couldn't really understand it,but they said "so don't use the
elevators or escalators."

Lessons were with Mutsumi, Mari, Manami, and Rin.

Mutsumi explained that the van der graffe generator had been used a
lot more than usual, so got a bit overheated, apparently setting off
an alarm.
