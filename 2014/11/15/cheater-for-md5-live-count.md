To simplify
[Counting with md5sum](http://www.reddit.com/live/thjep4nr9895), I
wrote a little javascript thing to recursively look for required md5
strings. Travis wrote a different version which I modified to make it
recursive.  He had done things like "use strict" and maybe something
else I hadn't done.

Once we got to 100, no one posted for a month.  I posted a few:

GivInG Up aLready? (100)
nah (101)
so sad (102)

/u/artbn mentioned that he was trying to search for strings one by
one.  I asked if he'd like a copy of the code for
[cheating at md5](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/live-md5-recursive-cheater).
He was like, "yep!" so I threw it up on Github.  Now the
[recursive-cheater](http://thunderrabbit.github.io/live-md5-recursive-cheater/)
is available as a github page.

After I posted the code, I realized I should have asked Travis about
the License, which he did before posting code for hakyll-journal.
Sorry!!
