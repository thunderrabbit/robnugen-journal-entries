Wow! This Sync product by BitTorrent seems pretty interesting! I
wonder where on my device it stores the data... right now I've got it
installed in my phone, but is that the only copy of my images?  If
not, whose data am I storing?  How does it deal with spotty
connectivity?  Hmmmm!

Get Sync at [http://www.getsync.com/](http://www.getsync.com/).

Oh, I think I understand!  It's basically a way for me to seed files
to other devices. The files don't go anywhere unless someone click the
link to receive a copy.
