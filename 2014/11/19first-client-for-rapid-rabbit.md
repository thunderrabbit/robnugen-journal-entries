I'm sure Rapid Rabbit is probably taken as a company name and website,
but I just thought of something to call my new(!) consulting
service. Basically, Soness was like, "can you help me organize my
stuff?" and I was like, "maybe!" and she was like, "I'll pay you!" and
I go "hmmmmmmmm!" So I went over to her place today and scanned a
bunch of business cards which I import into some kind of CSR software
(probably monkey mail for now); I'm going to go through a bunch of
receipts for her and I'll mail some papers to her accountant.  So I
guess this means I'm just acting as a personal assistant.  Also, I
washed dishes and she made lunch (in that order, so the dishes are
dirty again).
