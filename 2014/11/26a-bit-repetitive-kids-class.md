The first kids class yesterday included the song "Walking Walking"
about 20 times; I brought Johnny (the bear I bought in Thailand) and
had him join in the circle as we sang Walking Walking.  All the kids
wanted a chance to hold his hand, thought at first I tried to skip a
few kids to save time.  Not that I normally try to save time when it
comes to play, but I felt a sense that I was suppose to do something
productive during the class.  Some of the kids cried so we did a
little sit down circle and each one got to sing the song while moving
Johnny to the next kid.

During the second class one girl cried and went to the side of the
room while we played Hokey Pokey.  I had the entire class slowly move
from the other end of hte room to the side where she was sitting.  I
sat down beside her and she was still moe joe, but realized I was
there for *her* when I took her hand to help her stand up.  She was
all genki by the end and seemed happy.

A lot of the kids were all climbing on me, trying to high five me and
hang on my arms.  That part is fun and great, but trying to do a
lesson during the chaos is chaos.

"Can you say chaos?"
