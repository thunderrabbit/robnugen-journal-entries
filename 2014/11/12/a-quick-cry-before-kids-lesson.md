I'm prepping for the kids lesson today, and just had a good cry
regarding fear of standing and *performing* in front of groups!

I'm planning to use this
[Goodbye song](http://www.dreamenglish.com/goodbye) each day, and as
I'm here in front of my computer trying to learn it, I just felt this
surge of fear like OH FUCK! and just cried for a bit.

<del>Fuck this;</del> I can<del>'t</del> do it.

    HI Matt
    
    I've been teaching English to adults (1-to-1) for several years in Tokyo.
    
    Just recently I was asked to teach some kids classes.  :-O
    20+ kids!  age 5 or so!!   Such a new insane experience!
    
    Thank you for your resources; I linked to the Goodbye song from my
    journal, though my brain went blank when I tried to sing it today
    :-C
    
    I will dig through your site more before I start buggin' you with
	questions, but for now just want to say thank you.
    
        best
		- Rob
