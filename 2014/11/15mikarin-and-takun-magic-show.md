After ママ received presents and while we were eating cake, Mikarin
and Takumi did a magic show. Most of them were "look over there!"
tricks, but in one, Mikarin did a bit of memorization / card
manipulation. They didn't
[Fool Us](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1811179/) (or at least didn't
fool me), but it better than an obvious misdirect trick.
