Lin and I are packed and about to leave for 西武秩父駅 and then take a
bus to something something and then see Rohini!

##13:12pm

In about 15 minutes we'll arrive at 西武秩父駅.  Right now it's pretty
warm, though we have lots of jackets and coats!  I'm even wearing my
hiking boots!!

Lin has been a bit moe joe on the trains; she doesn't like having to
change trains so much and slog through crowds.

(I can imagine what Captain Hindsight would have to say!)
