I went to the toy shop near the Lotus dealership near Harajuku
station.  しばたさん recognized me, and I was all お待たせしました
[sorry to keep you waiting] when I came in.

They have a cool set of blocks to make marble tracks, including some big ones with near-baseball sized wooden balls that roll down the paths.

I showed her a video of marble track 2, but certainly didn't make her
sit through the whole thing.

She offered me a seat, though, when I got stuck trying to put together
a take-apart puzzle. Basically two rings bent in two directions until
they were horseshoe shaped.  It took me far too long to figure it out;
I was mm away from the solution, but hadn't wanted to squeeze them,
which is what was required to solve it.

Next time I go in, I'll solve the next take-apart puzzle: two giant
nails bent and interlinked.
