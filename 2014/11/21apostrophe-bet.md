[Longbets](http://longbets.org/) currently features 600+ predictions
about the future. The site encourages people to develop long-term
thinking to offset the instant gratification encouraged by
consumerism.

I came across this prediction:
["By 2030, the apostrophe will have functionally disappeared from American English."](http://longbets.org/658/).
To that I say "ha!"

I began to compose a dorky reply, 

    A post positing
    a post apostrophe society
    positively promotes
	the most promising
	deposit possible

but am not satisfied enough to post it on that site. It needs to reiterate ain't no way we're gonna give up on apostrophes!!
