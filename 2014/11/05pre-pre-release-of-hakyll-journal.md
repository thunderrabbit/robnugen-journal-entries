I'm so lucky to have an awesome programmer friend like Travis.  :-)

Over the past few days we have been emailing back and forth, mostly
with me going "uh huh" "yeah" "that's right" "great!" as he explains
the intricacies of the best way to create a haskell library.

I've been studying [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
and considering buying Graham Hutton's book, and am excited to have my
static journal back, very excited to have Travis making a kick-ass
library to seamlessly(?) connect with Hakyll to make it
journalistic...  I'm certain that some of the code he writes will end
up in the main Hakyll library.

I've been watching my new/old/new hakyll-journal repository, and just
happened to catch the first little bit, 3 minutes after he committed
it.
