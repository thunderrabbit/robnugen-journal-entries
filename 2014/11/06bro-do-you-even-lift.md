I ~~don't~~ didn't know what the meme "~~Bro,~~
[do you even lift?](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/do-you-even-lift)"
means (in fact, I thought "Bro" was part of it), but I wanted to title
this entry with a letter early in the alphabet because my entries are
sorted alphabetically (at the moment), and it's related to
[Lift](http://lift.do), specifically the
[Lift Open Coaching Program](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/lift-open-coaching-program-tickets-14004428623).

Anyway, I tried logging in to their coaching seminar, but was unable.  I had planned to live-blog it.

Here's how far I got:

Back to bed!
