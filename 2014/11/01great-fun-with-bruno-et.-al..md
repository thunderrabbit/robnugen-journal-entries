Mutsumi invited Lin and I to eat with her and hubby and nephew and
friends Bruno and Sachiko at a Taiwanese restaurant near their
house. I was enthralled as Lin spoke Mandarin with the proprietor for
a bit. So cool!

I was inspired to learn Japanese a bit more than before.

ブルノさんが９か月勉強してる、ペラペラできた。すごい！
