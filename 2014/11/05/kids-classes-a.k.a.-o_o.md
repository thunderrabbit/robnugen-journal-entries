Wow. Well, I survived the first day teaching a group of kids, they
seemed to have fun overall, and there was some semblence of learning
involved.

To be more specific, I just "taught" two classes of around 20 kids
each, the first group being a bit younger than the second; I'd guess 5
and 6 years old, but I heard they were 4 and 5 years old respectively.

I know the second class had 21 kids, because we counted everyone twice.

Yuuji (from JB, who introduced me to this school) and I agreed the
second class was better; I did the vocabulary game in a big circle
instead of two lines, and I had them not touch the cards, but just
point to the requested card.

Thanks to Mutsumi's friend Bruno, I had one song ready, to the tune of
*Fr√®re Jacques*:

    walking walking
    walking walking
    hop hop hop
    hop hop hop
    running running running
    running running running
    now we stop
    now we stop

We did some variants of that (flying, swimming, driving, riding
bicycle, walking backwards), usually not to the tune of anything but
pandemonium. :-)
