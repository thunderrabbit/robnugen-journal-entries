Good fun on the zipline course next to Pica Village.  I wanted to run
ahead, but it's physically impossible to pass people while on the
course (assuming everyone put their pulley on the zip line) (unless we
change harnesses!)

While waiting for people to move along on the course (so I could run
and catch up with them), I spoke with a staff person named Miyuki who
said she can finish the entire course in 30 minutes.  It took us 2
hours, though I'm certain I could finish it in one hour if not 45
minutes.
