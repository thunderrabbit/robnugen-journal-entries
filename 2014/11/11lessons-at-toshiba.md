Another first lesson today: 'twas the first time I taught at Toshiba
science museum near Lazona in Kawasaki.

I taught three lessons to three individuals, all of whom wore the same
uniform, so I'm not sure I could readily identify them in a lineup,
but the lessons were fun and I hope I will get to go back after
tomorrow, when I'm scheduled to be there for three hours.

The lessons ran from 4pm and they ended promptly at 6pm so I made it
in plenty of time to M&M lesson tonight.  I'm at Mini Stop having my
customary vanilla ice cream cone.
