And by "best" I mean, "well, I survived" though I'm mentally drained
and have no idea how I can do it next week. I read the book "Go, Dog,
Go" which they seemed to enjoy, but I didn't see any other English
books at the school.

I have no good way to start the lesson.  I've just done a crappy Hello
call and repeat thing but it's kind of shite.

After the crappy opening, I've been doing "Walking Walking" which they
definitely enjoy.

As I near the end of each song or section, I'm like "oh crap I have no
idea what to do next!" And today there were parents watching!  Eeeeeek!

The closing song, through crappy, has at least been consistent.  The
song I linked in previous entry is better and I hope I can remember it
next time.
