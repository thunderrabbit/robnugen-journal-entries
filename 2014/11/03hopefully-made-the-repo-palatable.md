I clobbered the git history of my hakyll-journal repo on GitHub so
that I could split my personal junk out of the basic journal.
Especially after Travis did a lot of nice refactoring, I wanted to
include that in a nice version that people could download and use.

It's done now, and I learned about ```git clone repo.git --single-branch```
