Sorry, that was Ted walking on my computer.

[Cloud 9](https://c9.io) is amazing!  How can they implement
SublimeText in a browser?  I can run emacs!  It's like I'm working in
a local shell..  So brilliant!

There's a ```.bash_aliases``` file, ```.bashrc``` so I can set up
aliases and stuff.  Wow.  I'd like the pricepoint to be a bit lower,
but dang it's pretty close to amazing.  If it can replace my local
computer, why not?

There are a couple of rough edges; I mentioned using emacs.  I can,
though C-b has to be pressed twice for each move-cursor-back command
(or whatever it is).  I guess some of the keystrokes are swallowed by
the something in the mix.

I was able to edit files in a repo, push the changes to github; wow wow wow!

This, for example, is being typed on Cloud 9's interface, which offers things
like visible whitespace,

drag and drop images(!), and though I haven't found it, apparently some type of image editor.
