Moe joe my back hurts, possibly from having been looking up at the sky
for hours last night.

Four guys in this cabin; one has already completely packed and made
his bed (he used to be in military, apparently).  Another guy is
nearly packed, and another is taking a shower, And I'm just here type
type typing with all my shit still unpacked hahaha.

Plan for this morning includes breakfast buffet and then zipline
course!

Okay gotta pack and go bye.
