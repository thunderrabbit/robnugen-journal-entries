<div class="dream">
Flying away from bad guys over a large hilly area, they were trying to
get me and my cat. We were in a city street and I was able to fly to
get away from them after a while.  I didn't realize I was dreaming
but I realized I could fly away so I did so.  I realized I could
control the situation a bit.  They were threatening me while inside a
room where I had been so I had to abandon that room.

<div class="dream">
Dreamed that some guys were hanging out talking about our lives and I
mentioned that my dad's dad hadn't been in his life and my dad wasn't
in my life now, and I wasn't in my kids' lives, but as I woke up I
realized actually my dad isn't in my kids' lives

and now as I type this I realize I don't have kids.
