Today Lin and I are at Charu's house (with the whole family of her
generation and under).

I accompanied Makarin and Takumi to the park where we played games
similar to Calvinball. While Takumi made up rules in realtime, Mikarin
was like はいはい.

I rather liked my game, basically throw a rubber ball onto a 3D
monkey-bar grid and get points based on where it first touches the
ground. It was conveniently a 5x5 grid, allowing for a sortof radial
scoring system (closer to center if more points)
