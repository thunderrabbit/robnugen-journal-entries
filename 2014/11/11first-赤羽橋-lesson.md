Today was my first lesson in 赤羽橋, a station whose kanji I cannot
really read yet, though I know each kanji individually if I read
slowly.

The lesson is a beginner level lesson, though I think the article I
brought was a bit too difficult for the level.  I'll bring an easier
article next time.

Only two students: A on the left wearing a necklace made by her friend
ten years ago, and A on the right with all his mobile devices.
