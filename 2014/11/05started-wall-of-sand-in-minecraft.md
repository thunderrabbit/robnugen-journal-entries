Back when Minefold was in business, I paid them to host a private
world for me.  They went out of business and I downloaded the world,
but couldn't get it working on my local machine until recently.

Since then, I built a relatively long minecart track in the nether put
a large portal at the end of it.  Delightfully, the overworld portal
happened to be quite close to a desert.  I moved the overworld portal
to the desert and started to build a big pile of sand for Fred and I
to use in making glass if we ever end up playing together in this
world.

I decided it would be cool/appropriate to make a pyramid of sand, so I
started doing that.

*Then* I realized I should bury something under the pyramid, so I dug
up the pyramid, built a little house, and rebuilt the pyramid,
thoroughly burying the house.  The house is actually connected via a
sub-surface tunnel, which is accessible by diving into a deep lake
nearby.

That was all maybe a month ago.

Today I realized it might be cool to make a huge wall of sand. So I've
started a wall which is probably about 200 blocks tall.
