<div class="dream">
We were walking around the kitchen / stores and a woman offered a
sample donut.  It was sticky raw on the inside but crispy on the
outside, just like the dough from which she pulled it.  She would rip
off part of the dough, including some crust and soft part inside and
fold it so that the crust would be outside.  I asked how she made them
and she showed me and I wondered if they were safe to eat, not being
cooked.  I got some other candy from a nearby place and then went back
to the corner of the room where M was sitting.

M came to SWUUSI with me though he wasn't fully "into it" as he had to
wake up early the next day and be in South Padre.  I was like, "that's
really far away, actually" so he decided to go there now and attend
SWUUSI from there.  I wasn't sure he'd have much time at SWUUSI that
way, but before I could say that his friends came up and jibed him
about a dog he had seen.  He denied it and and introduced me a bit and
I asked one of them his name.  He said Kelly or some other
could-be-a-girl's name.  I offered him some of the candy and he opened
his mouth.  Gross get it yourself.
