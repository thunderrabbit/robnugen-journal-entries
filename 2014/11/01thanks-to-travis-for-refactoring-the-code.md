Got an email from Travis today indicating that he refactored my Hakyll installation.  Whoohoo!!

The [refactorization he's done so far is visible here](https://github.com/TravisCardwell/hakyll-journal/commits/73c097622380ed70f30bcf51306c25c41d25fd92).

The biggest changes (in terms of me not understanding them well) are in one file.  [https://github.com/TravisCardwell/hakyll-journal/commit/05416e71fbbf0f910bcc19717ee88d7ae810c9bd](https://github.com/TravisCardwell/hakyll-journal/commit/05416e71fbbf0f910bcc19717ee88d7ae810c9bd).

I'm going to put all his changes into the 'master' branch, merge them into my recently created 'rob' branch, then replace my personalized content in master with some generic stuff so it's easier for people to use this repo for their own Hakyll installations.
