We were gonna take the express from 西武秩父駅 to 池袋駅, but the
seats were all sold out for the next train.  So we're on the local
train that terminates at a station halfway to Ikebukuro from
Seibu-Chichibu station.

I was willing to wait an hour (while eating ice cream) until the next
train, but the others wanted to get going.
