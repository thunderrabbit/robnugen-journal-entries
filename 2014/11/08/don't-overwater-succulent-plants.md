Their leaves rot when they are chilling in water.

Somone overwatered the aloe (?) Lin got from Mikako and its leaves
started to go black and fall off. ahem.

I dunno if it's revivable, but I put one of the still green leaves on
some course sand cactus soil and put the rootball in a separate
container with course sand cactus soil.

Next to the rootball, I put little still-green tips of leaves that had
otherwise turned black and mushy inside.  Dunno if those might grow,
but we shall see what happens.

The main problem for these plants here is lack of sunlight and excess
of cats.
