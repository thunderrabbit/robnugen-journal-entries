I saw a crappy transcription of a screenshot apparently taken from the
Sony hack.  It's even more amazing after they implied they had kept
the errors intact:

Original text:

    We've already warned you, and this is just a beginning.

Reported text:

    We've already wasned you, and this is just a beggining.
