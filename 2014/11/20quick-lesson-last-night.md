Last night JB school called me, "hey can you teach tonight??" and I go
"sure!" even though it was raining.

Got dressed, including a tie, rain pants, rain jacket, and even my waterproof
hiking boots.  Took Lin's bicycle because its seat is waterproof.

Smart me: I had my phone earphones in my ears (that's right,
future-people, we haven't had them permanently attached yet! (and we
certainly haven't re-achieved natural telepathy!)) because JB School
called me when I was halfway there.

"Nevermind!  sorry!  But we'll pay you half the lesson fee for your effort."

Fair enough.
