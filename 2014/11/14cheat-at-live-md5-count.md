/u/artbn commented on the
[MD5 live count](https://www.reddit.com/live/thjep4nr9895) thing that
he(?) spent 30 minutes searching for a string that would work for the
next number, but came up with nothing.  I offered to send him code to
help find strings.  He accepted so I pushed the code up to
[live md5 recursive cheater](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/live-md5-recursive-cheater)

I've also got a slew of precomputed values which, as of this writing,
I've pushed to an orphan branch (my first!) in my local repo, but not
pushed to github yet.
