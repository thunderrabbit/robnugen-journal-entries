I know the nimble cats can jump *over* it, but hopefully the mean
heavy cats will not.  There's a small brown cat who likes to chill on
our balcony.  We're not ready for three (3) cats, so haven't let him
inside.  But we have been feeding him because... cat!

However, there's a big bully cat who wants the same balcony space so I
blocked the small gap where they usually enter the balcony.  Lin says
she has seen the little cat jump over the railing, and I hope my
little fence will disuade the big cat from coming in.

Many thanks to the staff of our local tool+building materials shop.  I
like shopping there because I like to imagine it's closer to nature
than going to a 100 yen shop with plastic crap everywhere.

Though, ironically, I bought metal fences at the 100 yen shop and
plastic ties from my preferred shop.
