<div class="dream">
Floating on a rubber aft, lofted by the wind I was disconnected from
thwe ship's mast for a while, but was able to swim through the air to
get back to it a few times.  After a bit, I seemed not able to get
back, so my friend went to ask for help, but while he was gone, I made
it back and shimmied down the mast along with the raft. The crew who
came to help saw the equipment I had and praised me saying that I did
everything correctly and wouldn't have had a problem even without
their help.
