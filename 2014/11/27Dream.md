"ohhhh, those are *our* boxes!" we kept repeating it because the reality was setting in  We had decided to start a restaurant.  "Oh, those are *our* boxes"
Oh my goodness, we started a restaurant,  that's *rtight*!
I wondered how we were even going to get the boxes upstairs where we had space to put tables for people to eat.  I tried to wonder what it would be like with people inn our home, eating; who was going to cook? I guess I would have to do lots of dishes from here on out.  I realized that it wouldn't be that I had to wash every dish every niht, at least at first because they wouldn't have found out about our restaurant at first.  I consoled myelf that we'd have maybe a single couple as guests on the first night.

Loking at the refridgerator I knew it was full of food but we'd have to buy a lot more, and then carry it upstairs to be cooked or maybe serverd if we cooked down there.One guy was leaving just as the boxes came in.  he had been talking about something but we didn't need any, so we were liek "okay thanks an let him go


Lin got a phone call from Meg, who was related to the first person like her mom or daughter and I thought, oh it's related to the other news; someone had gotten hurt and then it turns out she was dying from yeras of smoking, and I was like, "well..." (ya should ahve thought of that before you started smoking) and Rita came over talking about a non-smoking campaign and I said yeah they have some resources in Shibuya to give peoplefor free and I'd take hero over there if she wanted.  She aaid no, politely, but I understood she was still in grief over the death to want to deal with something new. she needed to go or I jusat wanted her to go so I was like, "okay, so we'll see you later!" and got up so she left and as she was leaving a guy was brining in a bunch of boxes.  Who the hell are those for? We wondered...
