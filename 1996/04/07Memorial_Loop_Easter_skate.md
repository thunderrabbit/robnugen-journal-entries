<p class=date>Happy Easter!!  7 April 1996</p>

<p>Today I joined some of my friends out at Memorial Picnic Loop to
skate and have a picnic and skate some more.  The place was *packed*.
At first this kinda bugged me, but then I realized that the cars
slowly driving through the loop made great obstacles!  I carefully
skated past them, around them, or between them, (not over them) at
high speed.  I found that essentially no matter how close the cars
drove together, they would leave at least 6 inches between the
mirrors.  That allowed me to tuck and skate under the mirrors between
the cars if necessary.  I totally loved it.</p>

<p>At one point, about 8 or 9 such daring (or stupid) skaters were ziggin and 
zaggin through the cars.  We had great fun.</p>

<p>At one other point, I zigged when I should have zagged, and suddenly there 
was a skater in front of me where I wanted to go.  Doh!  I could not put 
on the brakes fast enough to stop before I kaplowed over the skater, so 
I grunched into the car beside him.  My shin made a resounding thunk on the
trunk and has a pretty good lump on it.  I made amends with the driver before
I continued.</p>

<p>At a different other point, I saw some of the guys I had been skating with
stopped in a parking area.  So I stopped over and they said they had a ramp.
I was all, "um, no- I don't have knee pads on today so I shouldn't"  One 
of them brought it out and I noted it was a straight ramp, as opposed to
a launch ramp.  Hmmm..  Okay.. so I did it.  The first time, no sweat.
The second time, I kinda messed up my landing, so I slid on my skate boots
and wrist guards.   "Did you hit your knees?" they called.   "Nope!  I was
like Bambi on the ice, but I did not hit my knees."     Whew.     
I jumped once more very small jump with no problem.</p>

<p>I skated around the loop a total of about 12 times, I'm guessing.  That would
make it about 14 miles total.  Great skate for a great afternoon.</p>
