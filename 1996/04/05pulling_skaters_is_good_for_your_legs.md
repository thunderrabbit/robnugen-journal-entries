<p class=date>5 April 1996</p>

<p>Last night my adventure started at Fuzzies, which, actually has been closed
for non-payment of taxes for a while now.  We've been meeting in the parking
lot across the street.</p>

<p>I saw my friend Danielle, who was in her car on her way to the Jones Plaza.
I was on my way there, so I had her pull me!  It was pretty cool, though we
"only" went about 20 mph, which is the speed at which the traffic lights are
timed.  (Sometime in my life I want to skate 60 mph.)  I simply hung onto 
her open window.  That way I was able to see any potholes or bumps in the 
road and easily avoid them. She pulled me about 6 or 8 blocks.  I was a bit 
nervous about cops, but it was way too much fun to be *that* nervous about 
them...</p>

<p>At the Plaza, I watched the skateboarders and aggressive skaters do all 
variety of grinds and jumps that I feel would necessitate wearing a helmet.
The only pads that I saw were some knee pads and shin guards.  One of them had
on a shirt that said, "IF IT CAN'T KILL YOU, IT'S NOT A SPORT."  That 
actually is about what I think, but I *do* wear a helmet.</p>

<p>I personally didn't do anything amazing at that point; I'm still
letting my bruised hip heal.  (I didn't even do a single parking
garage last night...)  I want it to heal before I go back to the skate
park tomorrow.</p>

<p>A group of us skated to The Big Easy, via Domino's Pizza, where there was a 
live band playing (at Big Easy, not the pizza place).</p>

<p>I met a guy named Scott, who is starting a business of renting time on 
paragliders.  To fly a paraglider, you have a big parachute thing over your 
head, and a big fan tied to your chair and you can fly around!  They have 
about an 80 mile range, so I think I'll rent one, and fly over to my dad's 
house!!  Ohmygoodness, the more I think about that, the better it sounds.</p>

<p>I also heard about some other *cooler* (cooler = faster and more
dangerous) sports that I want to try, like roller "surfing" using a
big ram-air parachute-looking thing to pull a person on wheels across
the salt flats in California..</p>

<p>And about some guys who had tremendous-wheel-size skates and totally flying 
down an amazingly steep smooth mountain highway..  I have *got* to try that.</p>

<p>With all variety of amazing ideas in my head, I mundanely skated on flat smooth
ground back to downtown.  Once I got there, I found a pack of guys on mountain
bikes, so I skated around with them a bit.  For about 2 blocks, I was able to 
maintain 17 miles per hour with one of them.  After that I let him pull me a
couple of blocks.  "It's good for your legs!" I told him after he complained 
about how hard it was.</p>

<p>We skated/biked down the steps at Alley Theater a few times.  The bike dudes
were doing bunny hops down them, trying to ride up them and lots of different 
variations of riding on the steps.</p>

<p>After that I stopped by Power Tools (skaters get in *free*!) for a bit.  
They had a live mexican-rock-rap band (whatever that means) and I didn't 
stay for long.  I stopped by the Plaza to watch the padless skaters on my 
way home.</p>
