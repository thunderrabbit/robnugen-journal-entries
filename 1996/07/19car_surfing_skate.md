<p>Last night when I went skating, I did some car surfing.  It's similar to 
people surfing, but I use cars.  The streets are all one way, so traffic is 
pretty predictable.  At the top of a hill (a hill for Houston), on the left
hand side of the street, I wait for the light to turn green and I start off 
with the cars as they go through the light.  Cars are parked in the left hand
lane, so at the next intersection, sometimes I have to get between the second 
and third lanes as a car turns left from the second lane; I don't want it to 
squish me.  Then I zip back to between the parked cars in the first lane with
the moving cars in the second lane.</p>

<p>Twice in the five times I did it last night, I crouched down underneath a
moving truck's side mirror as I zipped by within the four foot space between
the truck and the parked cars.</p>

<p>At the intersection at the bottom of the hill, I'm usually ahead of all the 
cars and I zip over to the left hand sidewalk to go back do it agian.</p>

<p>It's extraordinary.</p>
