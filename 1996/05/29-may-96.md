(I will figure out how to make the timestamp the way I want it.)

Last night I went to Nancy's wonderful dinner party and met Mandy, Lisa &
Evan Daily (sp), Pamela & Ford.  Ben Easton was there and me and Nancy.
Everyone was so *real* though I first thought Lisa looked a bit too good
for the rest of us, but after sending the talking rock around at opening
circle (at a dinner party!) we had all described where we were and Lisa's
seemed nearly the most emotional.  Wow.

Dinner was tremendous.. Practically too good for me. ;)

Talked to Ben, who hang glides out in Katy!!!!  I'm totally interested in
going to watch this weekend.  After that, I'm totally interested in going to
fly sometime.    
Ben played for us an audio tape of an orchestra performance he wrote and
conducted.  Way major cool.  It sounded like the background of a cartoon for
me, deep an menacing at first, and then light and airy near the end.  His
project was to use as many instruments as possible.

Mandy creates art out of sections of cloth.  Nearly quilting them together,
for a totally unique artform.  She loves to do it, and it appears she'll
start making money at it.
