I'm chilling at home (apartment in 高石５丁目) on this overcast day.
Sliding glass door is open facing greenery of hill also hosting a
single bamboo growing right up to the sky.

I skipped Mika's New York Yoga today because I woke up a bit late and
decided to work on AB instead.  3 hours of work on AB for a win.  6
hours for amazeballs.

Ready, go!
