<p class=note>(transcribed out of my diary)</p>
<p>
Sunday night Wende and I drove to Denton to harass Fred in class Monday.
<p>
We played 2 versions of the Alphabet Game (*) and had wonderful conversation on the way up there.  I don't remember what we talked about, but it was great.
<p>
Once we got there, I essentially fell asleep immediately after we got back from shopping for milk, OJ & pizza.  I ate one slice then slept.
<p>
Woke up and went to Fred's class.  Tamara was all nervous that it wouldn't work just right.  It was perfect.  I sat in the back with some dudes.  Test day and one of them was all, "you gonna take the test?"  <br>
"I'm just gonna put some bullshit down."<br>
He's all, "oh."<br>
I know he wanted to get answers from me.
<p>
Test was pretty easy pre-algebra.  I solved for 5 in (3x - 4) / (2x - 5) = (4x - 3) / 5 or something, and I drew a picture on the page.
<p>
The bonus was "describe how to solve inequalities using absolute values."  I wrote, "absolute values such as absolute love or absolute compassion for one's fellow man would solve all racial inequalities."
<p>
When class was doen, Fred went to his class and Wende graded the exams and I surfed and walked around campus.  When Fred was done, me Wende, G, Tamara all played frisbee and ran around and went to the Flying Tomato and harassed the guy behind the counter.  The girl behind the counter had amazing blue eyes and smile.
<p>
Went to a store filled with books and bells and crystals and drums and positive energy and all sorts of cool stuff.  Wende bought a cute wiggly toe ring and I enjoyed a $350 drum for a while.
<p>
Drove Fred's car a bit during that time and then went to the park.  They had a cool-ass swing set thing..  The top portion would spin!  We spun the girls who were sitting and screaming and Wende got sick to her stomach.  We got 'em going 'round pretty fast and pretty high.
<p>
Climbed all over a bridge-connected slide set and made up a game where you couldn't switch walls easily no tag people not on your wall. It was a crazy game.
<p>
We lay on the sidewalk to rest and talk.
<p>
Went back to Tamara's.
<p>
Slept from 5pm to 7pm and then drove home.
