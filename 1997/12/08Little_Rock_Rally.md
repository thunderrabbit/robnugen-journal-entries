<h1>1997 Little Rock rally review by Rob</h1>

<hr>

<p>
5 - 007 December 1997
<p>
The Little Rock Rally was, of course, absolutely incredible.  
<p>
I didn't look forward to the 9.5 hour drive, but as I expected, the
conversation was plenty invigorating to keep us chatting the entire
way up there.  In the rental car was Cathy S, KT H and I.  I brought
up a question that's been bouncing through my head for a while.
<p>
What are emotions?  Best I can tell is they *must* be experienced, and
maybe emotions are the reason we are alive.  The conversation turned
toward to What are instincts?  Are they related to emotions?
<p>
Notice how on an evolutionary scale, instincts (of a mosquito or
"lesser" animal) seem to be replaced by the emotions of dogs and humans
and other "greater" animals..  Hmmm..
<p>
(If you are intrigued, write me back and I'll send you my essay on the
subject)
<p>
We got there and it was **cold**!!  Well, chilly and late.. about 1:30
in the AM, I believe.  The rally craziness indicator was at a low
simmer.  Marc L and Tera L (different Ls) were already there and I was
glad to talk with them for a while.  Marc taught us some new songs and
games. "Little Sally Walker" was one song we learned that night.
<p>
Opening circle was cool.  Everyone tossed in their shoes and then we
all chose someone else's shoes and thereby randomly selected our new
neighbors in the circle, and the order in which we introduced
ourselves.  After that, we just stayed up late yakin' and talkin' and
having a lovely time.  I crashed at about 5 AM or so..
<p>
The next day I joined a group playing _Assassin_ and got promptly
tagged by Tera the first game.  I did better in the second game,
chasing Max around the parking lot for a bit.  That was a good
stretch, especially since I was running barefoot, and I haven't
otherwise been going barefoot much lately.
<p>
We also played _Animal Tag_ and that was pretty fun..  Oh yeah!  We
played a small game of _Wink_ and then a game of _Slaughter_, which one
of the other advisors taught me.
<p>
The YAC meeting was longer that most of our previous in-rally
meetings, but we had a lot to cover.  We YACked about the age limits
and brainstormed some ideas on how to convince the board to allow them
to be 14-20.
<p>
Dinner was a delightful ordeal for me.  I got to sit by Marc L and we
sat patiently waiting for our food while writing and drawing on the
huge spread of butcher paper on the table before us.
<p>
When our salad came, I immediately used my fork and grabbed a bite off
Marc's plate.  So he had a bite off my plate.  We continued this, and
actually ate our entire dinners from the other's plate.  The various
people (adults and young adults) serving us would shake their heads
gently as if to say, "whatever makes you happy" as Marc and I would
refer to each other in 3rd person to ask the servers for food for the
other..  Does that make sense?  Nope.. You should have been there!!
<p>
We had delicious fun.
<p>
After dinner, (I believe it was after dinner) Tera L, Marc L, Kat J
and I were chillin' in the sanctuary.  Marc's eyes suddenly
brightened, "we should make a fort out of chairs!"
Crazy!  Brilliant.
<p>
We unstacked and aligned a few chairs when Marc and Tera announced
they were going to build their own fort and we could have a war!
<p>
Kat and I randomly grabbed sleeping bags and carefully placed the
chairs to hold the bags as our roof.  With permission, we used Mark
A's massage table, which turned out to be a great part of our
fortress.
<p>
After not too long, Tera ran over to our side to spy on us or
something equally benign, and I captured her as our first prisoner!  I
led her into our fort, and underneath the massage table to her jail
cell.  She escaped without too much trouble, so we reinforced it with
more chairs and stuff.
<p>
The playfulness was delightful.  Kat was captured at least twice, and
at one point we had both Marc and Tera in our jail.
<p>
But the very funniest thing was when I was following one of our
prisoners into the fort and instead of going straight to the jail,
they stood up through a hole in the top (designed for throwing socks)
and climbed right out!
<p>
Yes, you had to be there.
<p>
I was dragging tired and had to miss the worship service, which I
believe was led by Marc.  I would have enjoyed attending, but I had to
*sleep*!
<p>
I was gently woken by some youth (I think Anna M and KT H) who really
really really wanted me to see the Talent Show.  I felt greatly loved
and went right up there.
<p>
Marc and Meghan R had just finished a whipped cream skit.  I was
going to be Marc's partner in it, but I was sleepin'.  
Whew..  It woulda been fun, but I was glad to remain whipped-cream-less.
<p>
I don't remember much of what I saw at the talent show; my contacts
were out and my brain was sleeping.
<p>
The next morning after closing circle where we handed out Houston
Rally Registration forms (send me email if you want one) and sang and
had a great time, several youth stayed for Marc L's sermon.
<p>
The topic was "Sacred Silliness," describing the value of silliness in
spiritual and emotional growth, especially as it applies to YRUU.
Afterwards I asked if we could put it on the webpage.  With an
emphatic "yes!" Marc said he would mail it to me (but I haven't gotten
it yet!!!  (MARC, ARE YOU READING??))
<p>
As we collected in the parking lot for the trip home, youth from OKC
and Cathy S and KT H were all goofing around.  It was decided we would
take Scott to Houston and they would take Cathy to OKC.  Nancy M was
all, "wha???  OKC is not exactly on the way to Houston," not
recognizing that we were jokin'.
<p>
We did, however, join them for lunch at Subway, extending the rally
love one more hour.  Scott gave me a big swig of the Groovy Juice and
KT got to drive the car (don't tell!) from our parking spot to the pay
phone and back.  (a whole 500 feet!)
<p>
The weather rained on the way home, but we had big fun.  The best game
we played was "Read All The Traffic Signs On The Side Of The Road."
Read all the words and say what the symbol signs mean ("merge left",
"slippery when wet") and say "dot" for each small circular reflector.
Design your own such game!  It was enough to keep us entertained for
50 minutes, the entire way from before Conroe till we got into Houston
area.
<p>
Amazing fun and see you all at Houston Rally!!
