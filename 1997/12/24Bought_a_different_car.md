This weekend I purchased a car.  I bought a 1990 Toyota Camry, 5 speed manual transmission, 94242 miles, beautifully clean silver exterior and grey velure interior.
<p>
Wende and I had just looked again at the first Camry I looked at.  I was all, "welll ..  maybe I'll get it."  Wende suggested that we go see what was available at the Toyota dealership we happened to be passing.
<p>
It was 9pm when we walked in. I told Stan I wanted a 1989 or 90 Camry and he went to check.  They had just received one that day at 4pm. Nice.<br>
We went to see the car, and Stan said their mechanics had not looked at it yet and he had no idea what to expect.  We found the car to be immaculately clean and Wende hopped in the driver's seat.  She couldn't start it.  "Push the clutch all the way in," we suggested. Nothing. Stan tried and it started no problem.  Hmmm.
<p>
So I drove us around and we found that the left turn signal didn't work quite properly, and the right front tire was out of balance.  Other than that the car's cool. <font size=-2>( - Jules in <em>Pulp Fiction</em>)</font>
<p>
We got back to the lot and I announced firmly, "I'll take it!" because my inner me said YES for sure. (Other cool things: there is an "evolve" fish with legs on the back, and a blood donor sticker on one window, and umbrella & windshield shade in the back seat)
<p>
Stan quoted $5000 plus or minus $300 depending on what the mechanics find.
<p>
(I'll keep the story short)
<p>
The next day, I signed papers for $5300 + TT&L for the car.  They had to replace the clutch, and the A/C compressor.  The wheels were still out of balance so the next day I got two new front tires and they fixed the left turn signal. Bonus. Partytime.  I am <em>happy</em>!
<p>
I named the car Scott.

Last night Scott and I went to my dad's house for Christmas celebration with my brother Fred. No tree, no muss, no fuss, just hugs and love and a few gifts.  Fred and I had the most fun with a set of colored blocks that are a gift for Noah, our first cousin once removed.

This morning, my dad and I went grocery shopping. I enjoyed spending the time talking with him.

<p>

On the way home today, Scott and I witnessed an accident. I parked Scott and hopped out to take notes. A Blazer had smashed into a pickup truck that hadn't yet moved at a green light, and another pickup truck slightly smashed into the Blazer.
<p>
The cops arrived fairly quickly and I gave them my version of the story and my phone number and stuff.

Now I'm at work watching to make sure the computers stay happy.
<p>
When I leave in a couple hours, it will be straight to my mom's house in College Station, 1.5 hours away.
