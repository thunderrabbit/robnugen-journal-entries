<p>
Today I felt really bummed out at work and I just wanted to quit. That was actually my impetus for starting my previous journal entry. After getting nothing done almost all day, I talked to Dave my supervisor, who I've known from back in the days since before he was a supervisor.
<p>
"Grrr." I essentially said. That helped.
<p>
We talked a bit and I determined that I've felt all bummed out and useless at work since my project deadline keeps getting set back(!) and I don't have the deadline pressure, so I just surf the web all day and feel like a lump.
<p>
I felt better and we set the deadline to tomorrow. Excellent.
<p>
On the way home, realizing having things to do keeps me moving and happy, I made a list and I'm doing quite well at getting it all done tonight.
