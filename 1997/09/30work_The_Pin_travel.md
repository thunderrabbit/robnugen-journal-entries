Today the president of the corporation that owns my company is coming to visit. They put up a big sign, hollerin' a "Big Texas Howdy!" 
<br>
gag me.

I showed off my project to Leila, who said it looked really good and she was quite pleased and impressed. Yay! She's a manager or something over the group that will be using the application, so I was glad she liked it.
<p>
I worked on <em>The Past Is Now</em>, my novel for a couple hours today. I made the chapter called "Androids" available, and shaped up a few of the other chapters.
<p>
I goofed around on <a href="http://www.backpackers.com">
www.backpackers.com</a> for a while today, and found that there
are people traveling all the time!!!  Me too!! me too!! me too!!
I wrote to a guy here in Houston who plans to trek from Houston to Anchorage Alaska starting in May 1998.  Wow.  That's a bit too soon; I'm planning my quest starting in August, but I wrote to him to see if I can get some tips from him.  
<p>
Tonight I'm going to install DOS and Windows for a guy who is not entirely computer literate yet. I enjoy being able to help others. Plus it makes the days go by faster so August 1998 will come sooner. I'm crazy, I know.
