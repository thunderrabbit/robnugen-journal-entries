<p>
As of earlier this month, I became totally debt free. 
Well, except for a $4000 medical bill that I still owe as a result of Wild Skating Adventure Six, totally debt free.
<p>
I'm a financial anomaly in this society!
<p>
As for the 4 grand, I'm probably not going to pay it off really fast- just pay several dollars per month to keep 'em off my back. Instead, I'm saving up all my dollars for my Extended Remix Roadtrip that will begin in about August 1998.  (God that seems so far away!!!)
<p>
I'm going to purchase a vehicle and new skates and a new bicycle and camping gear and a small tent or maybe just a sleeping bag tent thing (whatever they are called) and I'm going to drive around, half camping, half staying at friends' houses and stuff.
<p>
At this point, my trip is only in the planning stages. I have an itenerary sketched out: start in Houston, go up to Tomball to see my dad, then to College Station to see my mom, then maybe to Austin to see my step sister Karina, who I've known since long before our respective parents met.
Then up to Garland to see Carrie and then through Denton to say HI to Tamara.  Then through Oklahoma City and Tulsa over toward Springfield Missouri and then Jonesboro and Little Rock Arkansas.  Probably through Hot Springs Arkansas to check out the hot springs.
<p>
Then over to Radcliff Kentucky where I was born and then to Flat Top, West Virginia to see my dad's family, and probably park it there for the winter.
<p>
In the spring I'll emerge and probably drive west along the northern states (gotta go by Great America and that park in Sandusky (?) Ohio to ride The Raptor) and then swing down through Columbia, Missouri where I lived for 4 years, then to Colorado to see my friend Rocky (really that's his name) and then my brother in Las Cruces, New Mexico (if he's still attending school there).
Otherwise I'll just check out the latest craziness in Roswell.
<p>
Then check out the Grand Canyon and then Joshua Tree California and then to seem my friend Jen in Palm Springs.  Then San Francisco area and maybe I'll park it there for a while.
<p>
Now all of this is quite up for change at any minute.  That's the beauty of being free!!!!
