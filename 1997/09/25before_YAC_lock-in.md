I'm not totally sure what I'm doing with this webpage; it's
been idle for a while.  I haven't been working on my novel, or writing Wild Skating Adventures, or out of body adventures, or 
much of anything. 
<p>
So what *have* I been doing?
<p>
I've been working at work as a professional programmer, but that is not what I want to do all my life.  (More on that in a second)
<p>
I've been an advisor for high school youth in my district. I love it. The work is absolutely rewarding; it's the one part of my life where I feel like I'm actually making a difference in the world. The youth love me and I do everything in my power to help  their spiritual, emotional, physical growth. I love them all dearly.
<p>
This weekend the YAC members are meeting at Horizon Church in Carrolton, Texas.  We are planning for our Summit meeting in mid-October. This is the first lock-in this new YAC has experienced; I expect it to be quite fun and productive.
<p>
Jason Fricke and I are driving up from Houston tomorrow, picking up the key to the church from my friend Carrie Bruce and then I'll drop off Jason at the church so we can let everyone (who has  arrived) in. I'll go to DFW airport where I'll pick up Marc Lousteau and Tera Little. Then back to the church and the weekend begins. Yay!
<p>
Right now as I type this at work, I am listening to nine inch nails remix version of "perfect drug" as loud as my little CDRom headphones will let me. Nice, but I would like it louder.
