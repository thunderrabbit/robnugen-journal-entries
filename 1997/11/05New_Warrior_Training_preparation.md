<p>
Yesterday I got a call from Matt about the New Warrior Training weekend I'll attend November 14-16. He was all, "did you have any plans for how to get there?"  I told him I was just gonna go with my dad, who is attending as staff.  He said, "you're not going with your dad."  That settled that.
<p>
He gave me the phone numbers of two men who live in my area: Don and Fred, and asked if I would take responsibility for calling them and arranging rides.  No problem, I said.
<p>
"New Warrior Training?" you ask.  "What the hell is that?"
<p>
Well, I don't entirely know, but I have an idea that this weekend is designed to help men get in touch with their emotional nature and to dig way back into their brains and dig up a lot of repressed crap from childhood and growing up and life in general so this crap can be examined and processed as necessary. 
<p>
Hmmm.
<p>
Sounds refreshing, scary, liberating, and crazy.  Probably so.
<br>
I'll be certain to let you know how it goes.
