<h1>1997 San Antonio rally review by Mike</h1>

<hr>

<p>

Ok, first tera little picked me up at my house in plano at about 4 pm friday.
<p>
 Then tera and nathan sexton and i drove down to san antonio. it was kinda
bad though cuz tera's car doesn't have a clock or a radio, but we survived. 
Anyway, this is a good part. right before we got to the church, we called
from the texaco station and got bryan beck on the phone. we told bryan tera
got lost in waco and somehow ended up in this small town called sealy
somewhere near houston.
<br>
So bryan ran around the church looking for a map and we drove to the church
and tapped bryan on the back, said hey bryan what up? bryan almost started
crying. it was hilarious....
<p>
anyway, friday night we got there really early so there wasn't much going on
for a while. but opening circle was really good, they read a summary of what
samhain was and then everybody wrote a little samhain resolution and taped it
on the wall.
then broke into touch groups, that was fun i guess.
<p>
rest of night, nothing much happened.
<br>
Oh hold on, we watched South Park which was really good, i had never seen it
before since i dont get cable.
<p>
In the morning, had breakfast, the apple jacks were REAL good stuff.
The morning workshop I went to was the discussion with Drake Baer and Greg
Faron, the guys from Metro NY District (Princeton UU Church). This was really
good, we got to discuss a lot of the problems the Southwest District was
having and some solutions. I think it really helped me out...
<p>
Lunch was excellent, i loved that turkey.
Afternoon tarot workshop was awesome, those cards were really weird, they
predicted my life so well i was shocked!
then there was the smoking workshop, i didn't go, but most people who did go
said it was a lot of propaganda that they had already heard 10 million times
before, a waste of time...
<p>
Then dinner was awesome, yet again. I got deja vu looking at the dinner
table, cause it looked exactly the same as last years.
then sat. nite was really busy. The YAC meeting was interesting, my first.
 the bylaws were passed by YRUU, so the age range is increased to 20 and YAC
is going to be 8 youth and 4 adults now.
Then there were yac elections and after some confusion Maia Cudhea and Nathan
Ryan were elected.
Then the talent show.......
<p>
that was basically the night.
in the morning, clean up and breakfast.
Very fun rally.....

PS This isn't really part of the rally, part of getting there, but on the way
down there i had to listen to tera sing her silly song she sang to her kid:
<p>
I'm a Unitarian Universalist<br>
Oh Yes I am<br>
I believe in the<br>
inherent worth and dignity<br>
of every woman and man..
<p>
Ill sing the tune 4 anybody who wants....
