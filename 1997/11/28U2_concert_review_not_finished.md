<p>
My brother Fred and I went to see U2 in concert this night.  I had won tickets on KRBE several days earlier, and after much deliberation with myself and Wende, decided to invite Fred. 
Fred lives in Las Cruces, New Mexico, but he happened to be in Denton, Texas for the Thanksgiving holidays.  It was only a 5 hour drive from there, but he borrowed Tamara's car and drove down for the concert.
<p>
As soon as he got to the apartment, we left for the show.  We certainly didn't want to be late, and wanted to scope out the place to see if we could rush the stage.  In our haste, we forgot  cash to pay for parking (I did remember the tickets) so we got to the gate, and were all, "do you take anything besides cash?"
<p>
The dude goes, "nope cashownly."
<p>
"Okay, we don't have it. What should we do?"
<p>
"You can turn round and go out that last boof on the lef."
<p>
His pronounciation was fun.
<p>
We turned around and out the booth on the left (which was on the right after we turned around) and got cash and Fred fueled up the truck while we were at the gas station.
<p>
I got fifty bucks and we spent $4 to get back in (we went to the same guy) and $25 to get a T-shirt for me.  That left $21 and Fred couldn't get a shirt until he found a place that accepted credit cards.
<p>
(more to come)
