<p class=date>Saturday 15 November 1997</p>

<p>
This weekend changed my life.
<p>
When I first heard about <a href=http://www.mkp.org>New Warrior Training</a> I was quite not interested.  Some kind of initiation into manhood... and I wanted nothing to do with it.  That was two years ago.
<p>
The reason I wanted nothing to do with it:  I was afraid of men.<br>
I certainly didn't want to become a man.  And I doubly certaintly didn't want to be associated with men and known as a man.  No way.
<p>
Almost a year ago I attended a New Warrior graduation ceremony.
<br>
The men I saw on stage were not too scary.  They were acting as real humans, with feelings, and expressing their emotions.<br>
Hmmmm.<br>
Maybe it's not so bad after all.
<p>
After I attended a second graduation, I knew I wanted to do it.
<p>
I called my dad and asked if he had ever heard of it.
<p>
"Yep!  And I've signed up for the weekend in August!"
<p>
Wow.  I was actually kinda jealous, but really happy for him.
<p>
My weekend was this weekend. It really changed my life, but as I write this, I recognize I don't wish to share all the details with the world (even though this site gets so few hits per day...)<p>
But I learned a few things:<p>
<ul>
<li>I can trust men and survive.</li>
<li>Without realizing it, I have grown to be a man.</li>
<li>There is still a lot more to learn.</li>
</ul>
