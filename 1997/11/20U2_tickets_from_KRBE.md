Cool!  Just this morning I was listening to <a href=http://www.krbe.com>krbe</a> on the radio, and the DJ was all, "we don't have a copy of Young MC's "Busta Move"" and I was all, "I've got it!"  And I played it for them over the phone and on the air and they were all singin' and dancin' and basically goin crazy with it.<p>
And they gave me tickets to Astroworld!  Yay!!
<p>
I went in to the station to pick up my tickets, and after a few minutes, I got to go back to the broadcasting studio and be on the air!  Totally fabulous and Sam Malone and I were jokin' a bit about how we could go on tour... "it'd be two white guys," he said, "trying to bust a move on tour."  Silly wacky stuff. Then as I was leaving, he's all, "we're gonna give you Rockets Tickets
and you can be in the 104 KRBE Suite!"  YES!!
<p>
Out of the studio, Chuck was about to sign me up for the tickets, and I said, "hey, uh I can't go to the Rockets game.."  He was all, "um, okay.. I'm not sure what other tickets we have.." and them someone was like, "we might have some U2 tickets."<p>
My eyes and face lit up.  <b>"YES!"</b><p>
I got two U2 tickets, which went on sale in April for the concert 28 November, and normally cost 75 bucks each!!!<p>
<b>YES!!!!</b>
