<p class=date>Friday 7 November 1997</p>

<p>
Today I am sick as crap and I'm home from work. I just slept 4 hours and it's about 4pm.  I'm writing because I just had an awesomely detailed and useable dream.
<p>
I was at work and we had some kind of meeting to evalutate how we felt about our jobs and such.  No one could find my evaluation, so I just straight told them.
<p>
"I hate this job and what I really want to be doing is working with youth."
<p>
Kate looked quite seriously at me, "what do you mean?"
<p>
"All this corprate bullshit I totally hate and I want to get out of here."
<p>
She told me what a true friend would say, "Well, if that's what you want then totally go for it!"  She leveled with me, "we've got about 8 more weeks of difficult work ahead of us, and after that time, I can see no problem whatsoever with you leaving."
<p>
My other coworkers were just as helpful and supportive, suggesting places I could live or go to school to get a Master's in Education or something.
<p>
Hmmm.
<p>
At that point the dream started to get wacky and we were looking at pictures of people in a magazine and saying "I hate you," which I interpret as "I take all my stresses out on the world when it's due simply to my lifestyle which I hate."
<p>
I woke up soon thereafter and pondered the dream.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
I am now remembering that as I woke up this morning, I had another dream, one that I was working as a camp counselor for elementary and junior high aged youth.
<p>
I currently shudder at the thought of any kind of instruction toward that age group, but the counselor idea doesn't seem too far off base.
<p>
Hmmmm.
<p>
