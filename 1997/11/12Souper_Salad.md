<p>
Tonight was our Souper Salad hangout dinner and it was crazy!!
<p>
I misunderstood exactly where it was located, and I parked closer to San Felipe than to Westheimer. I just figured it was right around the corner so I walked.<br>
It wasn't toooo far, only 2 city blocks, but it made me a bit late.
<p>
As I approached, I could see kT and Jon crouched on the floor, peeking out the windows at me. Jon snuck out in an attempt to ambush me, but I saw him and kept some parked cars between us and ran toward the door and inside, to find kT and Dennis huddled in mock fear by the front counter. <em>Oh my goodness this is going to be a crazy night.</em><p>
I couldn't figure out what to say to them; I turned without a word and got my tray. They jumped up laffin'
<p>
They were just silly this night! This was our waiter's first night, so they harrassed him well, even to the point of embarassing <em>me</em> by clonking their cups together and on the table to indicate they were still without water.
<p>
Maggie and Wende arrived late, and we all had a great time.  The manager was quite chill about the antics at our table, even when kT and Dennis had salt and pepper wars with me, and even after our meal when we ate sugar out of the packets.
<p>
Jon was the last to leave, and I told him about Thunder Rabbit and a new surprise.
