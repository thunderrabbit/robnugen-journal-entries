A few days ago I paid bills. My medical bill sticks out like a sore thumb among all the rest.  It's $3853.  I have paid off all my other debt, but I didn't want to pay off my medical bill because it doesn't charge interest and who cares, anyway?
<p>
I consulted my runes.  I had decided if I choose a rune upright, I would pay a significant portion of my debt, and just do it. I chose a rune in its upright position, but I can't seem to remember which one it was.  
<p>
I paid $2000 and felt good but with a tinge of loss.
<p>
A couple days later I got a check in the mail for $677.  Not 2 grand, but wow.  I thought it was pretty cool.
