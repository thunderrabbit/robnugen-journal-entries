<p class=date>weekend of 21-23 November 1997</p>

<p>
This weekend we had our Construct-O-Con planning rally for the 
full blown rally in January.  
Anna M, Charlotte B, Christina L, Jason F, Jim M, Jon M, Jon W, KT H, Nick C, Rob N and Wende W were all there for most of the weekend.
<p>
We were way more productive than I had expected. The first night we got the theme figured out: "Imagine The Cat in the Hat (burning the flag)"  (or something like that.) (Last year we didn't even start planning until 5pm Saturday.) We wanted an imagination-provoking theme, and one of the main speakers will be discussing First Amendment rights, including (but not necessarily encouraging) the right to burn the US flag.
<p>
The next day, we hammered out the schedule and disbursed the various tasks to those who were present.  I look forward to a super great rally with these guys.
<p>
Though we were dragging by the end of Saturday, we got the T-Shirt design completed, and it was all good.
<p>
Also during the weekend, we play much hackey sack, listened to Jason's bump while playing frisbee, watched 3 or 4 movies, including <em>Brain Candy</em> (which we watched at last year's Construct-O-Con), <em>Mars Attacks</em>, and a freaky stop action animation film by Frank Zappa, which was mostly clay animation, and I was amazed at the detail they created, especially for such a long movie!  It was pretty incredible.
<p>
Sunday morning we cleaned up and got up.  I'm thankful for Wende who was much better at describing to the LRY group (who were mostly not at the lock-in) about the joy of rallies and designing them and all that.<br>
Next rally is Little Rock Rally 5-007 December 1997
