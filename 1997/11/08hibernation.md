<p class=date>Saturday 8 November 1997</p>

<p>
I have hibernated in my apartment this entire weekend. I've been sleeping about two-thirds of the time and doing a bit of writing in The PIN. 
<p>
My sleep has been sporadic; once I woke up hacking and gagging on phlegm and snot and bluh.  I locked myself in the bathroom and took a hot shower until all the hot water was gone.<br>
Some of my dreams are lucid; I don't recall any out-of-body excursions.
<p>
I definitely had to skip Ultimate tonight.  Unfortunately, I'll be skipping it the next two weeks, and I have already skipped it the past two weeks.  Nuts.
<p>
Interestingly, Wende is gone this entire weekend, from Friday morning to Monday evening.  Apparently, this is time for me to take care of myself.  I've enjoyed it.
<p>
I plan to be well enough to attend church tomorrow.
