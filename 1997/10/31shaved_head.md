This morning I shaved my head. Down to my bare scalp; did it myself in the shower. Quite a fun costume for Halloween.
<p>
I'm dressed as a bald guy!

I'm excited about the Rally <b>(tonight!)</b> in San Antonio, and the youth going, "whoah dude! you shaved your head again!" (I shaved it at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/heartland/2735/rob_swuusi_1997.html" target="resource window">SWUUSI</a> this past summer.)
<p>
I enjoy having my head shaved. The surprising sensation when I touch my head still pleasantly shocks my hand each time. Try it. Your hair will grow back.
