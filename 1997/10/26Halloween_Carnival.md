<p class=date>Sunday 26 October 1997</p>

<p>
At 5:45 in the am, after we had slept about 3 or 4 hours, the lights flashed on and immediately back off as Gerald came in to set up the chairs for the day.
<p>
I popped awake and hopped up and went to talk with him.  "Um, we spent the night here last night, can you open the LRY room so we can sleep in there instead?"<br>
He said, "no problem" or something equally positive and we trudged outside to the LRY room to crash.  kT claimed the larger of the two couches, so I stole a cushion off it.  <em>Whoah!</em> it's a couch bed!!
<p>
So we pulled out the mattress and kT and Paul crashed on the bed.  I burrowed in between them, stating, "I'm making sure you guys don't try to get busy together."
<p>
We slept for a few more hours (actually Paul didn't sleep because the mattress was at a slant where he lay. I felt really bad about that when I found out) until people started arriving at church.
<p>
Wende and Paul got up and got donuts and orange juice for us to munch, which we did happily, chatting and acting silly.
<p>
The carnival was great fun, especially after rumors that it wouldn't happen. I most enjoyed
<ol>
<li>sneaking into the back door of the haunted house and scaring the boogies out of Emory and whoever else was back there. Once he regained his composure, he was all, "hey! you can't do that!" but he was wearing a glowing retainer thing and it sounded like, "hey oo an oo ah!" Funny!</li>
<li>after a while we went back to the LRY room, dreading the clean-up process. We were so tired... But I walked over to the haunted house and people were already cleaning it up! Three adults and some of the younger kids, and I zipped back to our room.  (I don't feel 1 iota bad after all the effort we put into building the thing.)</li>
</ol>
<p>
Wende's truck, Bill, had a flattening tire, so we got it fixed on the way home.
