Tonight we had super great fun at California Pizza Kitchen! In this case, we = Wende W, Jon W, kT H, Laura M, Dennis ?, Paul R, and me Rob N. This was the first of at least 2 Wednesday night LRY outings. Wende and I told the youth that she and I will go eat at CPK, and if they wanna show up, that would be great!
<p>
Heidi, our waitress, joked a lot, making references to our invisible friends before everyone had arrived. When she came back with our water, I said, "Yay!" and she teased, "it's only water."
That was funny. I kept saying "Yay!" each time she refilled my glass.
<p>
Jon and I sat at one end of the table and talked about the existence of non-physical beings called Allies. All the stuff he described to me that he had figured out for himself matched quite well with what I had read in the book <em>Bringers of the Dawn</em> by Barbara Marciniak. (This is the third time that Jon has told me stuff he has figured out himself without knowing I had read it in a book somewhere. Amazing!)
<p>
The other portion of the table mostly talked amongst themselves, though I kept an ear listening to them as well. Paul participated in both conversations.
<p>
kT and I made several comments about what Annie likes. Annie is a friend of ours (who we've never met); Annie likes some things and doesn't like others. The trick is to figure out the pattern of things that she does or does not like. Wende gets so frustrated when we play!
<p>
We had a fun night, though a bit expensive, so we probably won't eat there again next week. We will keep lookin' around to find just the perfect spot for our weekly friendly gatherings.
