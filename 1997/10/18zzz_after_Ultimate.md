<p class=date>3AM Sunday 19 October 1997</p>

<p>
After Ultimate, I walked Kat and Nikki(sp) back to the dorms. They invited me in for Gatorade down in the basement.  We got down there and some people were already watching the movie <em>Daylight</em> starring Sylvester Stallone. So we watched and Sly was climbing through a huge exhaust fan, blowing up mud to stop a leak, using a radiator tube to save a guy from drowning, risking his life to save the dog, and then he and <em>the girl</em> got separated from the rest of the group. 
<p>
The rest of the group was promptly saved by rescuers, and then Sly and she had to go back the way they had come, which was now way more treacherous since the water was way deeper. And then
<p>
Some dumb western movie began! They didn't show the end of the movie swear to God it was like the TV had changed channels!
Noooooooooooooooooooo!!!!   We cried.    Noooooooooooooo!!  WHERE'S THE REST OF THE MOVIE????????
No use. It was gone. 
<p>
The TV station showing the movie was the Student Video Network, local only to University of Houston, and I guess they just screwed up or assumed no one would be watching, or they are just very twisted and evil.
<p>
So I went home. On Allen Parkway, there were zillions of bicyclists and several skaters all with green glo-lites and stuff biking or skating their way toward downtown! I did a U-turn at Montrose.  
<p>
"What's this all about?" I asked.
<p>
"The Moonlight Bicycle Ramble!  Happens each October"
<p>
"Awww man!!! I've wanted to do this!!!"
<p>
"Come join us then!!"
<p>
Greatly enthused, I zipped home and stepped inside around 3AM.
<br>
3AM... should I go?  I consulted my runes. If you pick a rune upright, that means "YES."  If you pick a rune reversed, that means "NO."
<p>
First I chose <em>Gebo</em>, then <em>Sowelu</em>. They each look the same upright and reversed. On the third selection, I chose <em>Uruz reversed</em>, so I didn't go.
