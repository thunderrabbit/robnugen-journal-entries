Today I changed the format of my journal index to this calendar
look.  Yeah it looks kinda weird with various width columns and such, but I like it better.  Gives me a better sense of when things happened.

Today things are kinda screwed up at work.  My supervisor said,
"people should be jumping through their asshole to get this fixed."  I
thought that was a really funny phrase. He said I could use it anytime
I wanted.  :)
