Found out yesterday that all is not perfect with the new invoice service. The program is fine, but the group in charge of making the data files it uses have not got their stuff straight...
Oh yeah- that's my group in charge of that.  shit.
<p>
So today I'm here writing the batch files that will produce the data files and I think I'm all done; I'm testing them now.
<p>
Tonight I'm picking up Jason F at 7pm to drive out to Austin so we can discuss the future of youth programming with the district board. We want to make sure that youth programming remains controlled by the youth.
<br>I'll tell ya later how it all went.
<p>
"Howdy!" to all my friends at Ultimate tomorrow night who I won't get to see.
