<p class=date>Monday 20 October 1997</p>

<p>
This night Jon W and I went to the Board meeting at church to request permission to hold the Houston Rally at Emerson Church this year (well, January 1998). I let Jon do essentially all the talking and he did great and we got it!
<p>
Pam B said "Yes!" before he even finished asking the request; she helped the rest of the members understand the value of the event.
<p>
After we left, Jon and I talked for easily an hour about spirituality: Allies, god, Pleiadians, Mayans, the end of the 3D world, and about awareness techniques: lucid dreaming, opening one's third eye, meditation, and astral projection.
<p>
"I see my hands, therefore I am dreaming."
