Last night I played Ultimate at University of Houston as we do each Saturday night. Ultimate is the best frisbee game in the world, for those who don't know.
<p>
The coolest thing lately is that a lot of new players (incoming freshman who live in the residence halls) have joined us this year. And they're all good; some of them play super excellently!
<p>
HellKat, Mike, Jenny (sp), Rick, John, and Terry arrived (in that order) to play.  Jenny is the best of the new group; she has played in the past.
<p>
We played either 4 or 5 games, and I did relatively well, including a surprise difficult sideways one handed catch (scored a point), and a tumbling on my back roll non catch (but close) and fun stuff like that.
<p>
After the games it was like 2:45 in the am, and I walked Kat back to the dorms. We drank Gatorade and talked down in the basement. John said HI a couple of times as he was doing his laundry.
<p>
Got home and to bed around 3:45, super exhausted after a great time playing.
