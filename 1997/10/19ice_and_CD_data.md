<p>
This night Wende and I drove out to my dad's house to say HI to him and my brother Fred, who has been in from Las Cruces, New Mexico, pursuing a Masters degree in Engineering or something crazy like that.
<p>
Fred and I have fun playing together. When asked to go get ice, we went to the store and got a five pound block of ice. "We followed the letter of the law, but not the spirit," Fred would say later.
<p>
We took turns <em><b>WACK</b></em>ing it with a framing hammer to break it up into pieces that would fit into drinking glasses.
<p>
Fred described to me how information is stored on a compact
disc. Pretty interesting stuff, with all the data correction stuff
stored on the CD. The end result: Have you noticed that your CDs will
play fine on one player and then skip like crazy on another? <em>"This
CD worked perfectly yesterday!"</em> The player you played it on
yesterday has a processor that can better calculate the correct
information, given that there's a scratch on the CD. Fred said the
difference in price in CD players often simply indicates how good of
an error correcting algorithm it uses.
<p>
Fred and I stayed up talking until like 12:30 Monday morning.
