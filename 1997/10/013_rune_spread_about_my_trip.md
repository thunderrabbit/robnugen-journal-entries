<p>
Today I felt moved to consult my Runes about my travel plans, and how I am so
excited and want to travel *now*!
<p>

I did a 3 Rune spread.  The first Rune (reading from right to left) describes the 
"overview of the situation;" the second Rune (center) identifies the "challenge;"
and the third Rune (left) indicates the "course of action called for"
<p>

I had selected <em>Laguz</em>, <em>Eihwaz</em>, and <em>Sowelu</em> 

<p>
I don't consciously know their meanings very well yet, so I consulted my book.
<p>

<p>
Overview of the Situation:  <em>Laguz</em>:
<p>
Unseen powers are active here, powers that nourish, shape and connect.  
The attributes of this Rune are water, fluidity, the ebb and flow of emotions,
careers and relationships.  <em>Laguz</em> encourages you to immerse yourself in
the experience of living without having to evaluate or understand.  It speaks
to the satisfaction of emotional needs, to the awakening of the intuitive or 
lunar side of your nature.  For while the sun strives for differentiation, the
moon draws us toward union and merging.
<p>
This Rune often signals a time for cleansing: for revaluing, reorganizing,
realigning.  A Rune of deep knowing, it may call you to study spiritual matters
in readiness for self-transformation.  Success now lies in contacting your
intuitive wisdom and attuning to your own rhythms.  A Rune of self relating
rightly to the Self, <em>Laguz</em>, signifies what alchemists called the conjunctio or
sacred marriage.  In fairy tales, it is the end where the hero and heroine live
happily ever after.

"self-transformation"   <br>
I hear <em>this will be a rebirth of myself</em>   )
<p>

<p>
Challenge: <em>Eihwaz</em>:
As we are tested we fund the power to avert blockage and defeat.  At the same
time, we develop in ourselves an aversion to the conduct that creates stress
in our lives.
<p>
If there appears to be an obstacle in  your path, consider that even a delay may 
prove beneficial.  Do not be overly eager to press forward, for this is not a time
or situation in which you can make your influence felt.  patience is the counsel <em>Eihwaz</em> offers:
nothing hectic, no acting needy, or lusting after a desired outcome.  This rune speaks to 
the difficulties that can arise at the beginning of a new life.  Often it announces a time
of waiting--for a spring to fill up with water, for fruit to ripen on the bough.
<p>
Perseverance and foresight are called for here.  The ability to foresee consequences
before you act is a mark of the profound person.  Avert anticipated difficulties through
right action, this Rune is saying.  And yet even more than we are doers, we are
deciders.  Once the decision is clear, the doing becomes effortless, for then the 
universe supports and empowers our action.
<p>
Receiving <em>Eihwaz</em>, you are put on notice that, through inconvenience and discomfort,
growth is promoted.  This may well be a trying time; certainly it is a meaningful one.
So set your house in order, tend to business, be clear, and wait on the Will of Heaven.
<p>
(This is not the first time I've been counseled "patience."
"do not be overly eager to press forward" "avert anticipated difficulties
through right action"
"once the decision is clear, the doing becomes effortless"
"wait on the Will of Heaven"<br>
I hear <em>it is good and necessary that you plan and wait until the right time. </em> )
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Finally, the Course of Action Called For: <em>Sowelu</em>:
<p>
<em>Sowelu</em> stands for wholeness, that which our nature requires.  It embodies the impulse toward self-realization
and indicates a path you must follow, not from ulterior motives but from the core of your individuality.
<p>
Seeking after wholeness is the Spiritual Warrior's quest.  And yet what you are striving to become in actuality is what, by nature,
you already are.  Become conscious of your essence and bring it into form, express it in a creative way.  A Rune of great power,
making life force available to you, <em>Sowelu</em> marks a time for regineration down to the cellular level.
<p>
Although this Rune has no Reversed position, there is reason for caution.  You may see fit to withdraw, or even to retreat in the
face of a pressing situation, especially if events or people are demanding that you expend your energy now.  Know that such a retreat
is a retreat in strength, a voyage inward for centering, for balance.  Timely retreat is among the skills of the Spiritual Warrior.
<p>
<em>Sowelu</em>counsels opening yourself up, letting the light into part of your life that has been secret, shut away.  To accomplish this
may call for a profound recognition, for admitting to yourself something that you have long denied.
<p>
There is a prayer, known as the <em>Gayatri</em>, that embodies the spirit of the Rune of Wholeness.  Address the sun in this fashion:
<blockquote><em>
You who are the source of all power,<br>
Whose rays illuminate the world,<br>
Illuminate also my heart<br>
So that it too can do Your work.<br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
While reciting the <em>Gayatri</em>, visualize the sun's rays streaming forth into the world, entering your heart, then streaming out from
your heart's center and back into the world.  This is a powerful and life-enhancing payer.
<p>
There is a caution here not to five yourself airs. Even in a time of bountiful energy you are required to face and vanquish your refusal to let
right action flow through you.  Nourish this capacity, for it is a mark of true humility.
<p>
Practice the art of doing without doing: Aim yourself truly and then maintain your aim without manipulative effort.  Meditate on Christ's words:
<em>I can of mine own self do nothing</em> (John 5:30).  For by our own power we can do nothing: Even in loving, it is Love that loves
through us. This way of thinking and being integrates new energies and permits us to fow into wholeness, which is the ultimate goal of the
Spiritual Warrior.

(Holy cow. Since August, I have been planning to attend a New Warrior Training weekend in November 1997. 
This weekend allows opening of the heart and digging up old crap and getting that stuff out so it can leave 
your being or be properly expressed!
I hear <em>Continue living the path of the heart; it's challenging, but you can do it.</em> )
