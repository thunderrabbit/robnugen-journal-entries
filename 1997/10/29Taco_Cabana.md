<p>
This evening at Taco Cabana for our weekly LRY Dinner Hangout, Jon W was already there when we arrived. He showed off his new braces and new pager; "what's different about me?" he asked as I greeted him.
<p>
We ordered and Paul R arrived as our food appeared on the counter. I got a Suicide as my tasty beverage and we sat outside to chat and chew.
<p>
We talked Rally stuff, as this coming weekend is the San Antonio Rally, and Jon and I are working on the Houston Rally for January, and the Houston Planning Rally for next month! We had just gotten out the registration forms for the Planning Rally ("Construct-O-Con") a few days previously.
<p>
Jon practiced intonations (I guess that's what one might call them) for his drama class: practicing articulating various vowel sounds without getting tongue tied. (say that 10 times quickly)
