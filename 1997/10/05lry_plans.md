<p class=date>5 October 1997</p>
<p>
Today at church, the youth group got some great plans underway for this year's activities.  First on our calendar is planning for a church-wide fund raising (for Unicef) Talent Show! 
<p>
I absolutely love how the youth are brainstorming, planning, organizing all their own activities. Wende and I are just there to help guide them but let them pretty much do their own thing.
<p>
Next planned thing (which will actually occur before the talent show) is a lock-in / haunted house creating day on the weekend of the 26 of October. We'll come in early on Saturday and help the younger kids build their haunted house. Once we're done and they're gone, we'll go to a professional haunted house and then come back and play and whatever until Sunday morning.
<p>
Sunday morning we'll help run the kids' haunted house or whatever. Should be great fun.
