<p class=date>Wednesday 22 October 1997</p>

<p>
Wende and I went to Taco Cabana for our Weekly LRY Hangout thingy. I was amazed that we made it on time; Wende had been in College Station about an hour previously. She said, "I didn't exactly get here legally."
<p>
Paul R arrived essentially on time and we waited for a few minutes for any stragglers. We talked physics and about the Mars Sojourner and the Mars Sample Return programs.
<p>
Wende got more involved with the conversation once kT and Dennis arrived, talking about school and French III classes and all kinds of fun stuff.
<p>
At some point, Dennis said something really funny and kT snarfed her tasty beverage. Conversation turned to various snarf stories, and I think snarfing warm orange juice was the worst. (Who would drink warm orange juice in the first place??? (Apparently Dennis))
<p>
The goal quickly became "who can make kT snarf again?" and we all started getting silly silly.  Dennis made a crown out of his cup, but it wouldn't stay on his puffy hair. (It wouldn't stay on my lack of hair either...) Dennis started throwing bits of tortilla, and I made a tortilla mask out of mine.
<p>
Once the silliness sobered up, kT went to use the phone. I put my tortilla mask in her jacket pocket, which seemed appropriate since conversation had turned to pocket watches. Why not pocket tortillas??
<p>
As far as I know, she didn't figure it out until after we all left. Heh.
