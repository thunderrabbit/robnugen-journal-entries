Today Wende and I walked to Marble Slab for some ice cream. Yummy delicious! We rationalized that by walking, we would work off the calories gained by eating there.
<p>
On the way back, we stopped at TravelFest, which is like a splashy jazzy colorful fresh new multi-service travel center, where you can watch videos of where you want to go, purchase luggage to take, and then purchase a ticket and away you go!  
<p>
I watched a video of some dudes snow skiing, snow boarding, and snow kayaking!! Incredible steep fast breathtaking way to travel 3000 feet. I totally wanna do that!! My friend Rocky, who lives in the Rocky Mountains has invited me to come snow boarding. That video certainly reminded me that I have that option open.
<p>
Wow.
