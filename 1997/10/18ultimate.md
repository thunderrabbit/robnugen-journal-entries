Ultimate was super fun tonight.  Cold dew on long grass froze my toes unless I kept running, dancing around all night (or stayed out of the grass).  I played fairly well all night, scoring a few points and making a couple great catches, sliding, tumbling, and/or jump-thudding* to catch the disc.  My teams lost the first two games we played, then I think won the second two.

* Jump-thud is a leaping, diving catch where the body is prone about 2 or 3 feet off the ground and then <em>thuds</em> upon landing.  Tim is well known for this move.
