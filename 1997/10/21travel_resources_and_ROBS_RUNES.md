<p class=date>Tuesday 21 October 1997</p>

<p>
Today at work I mostly read <em>The Pleiadian Agenda</em>, and "Communities" magazine. And I surfed the web, starting with <a href=http://www.ic.org>www.ic.org</a> Intentional Communities page.
<p>
In the past several weeks, I have been finding many diverse resources that will help with my trip!
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href=http://www.backpackers.com>Backpackers.com</a>, designed to give travelers an email address and forum for communication and resources</li>
<li><a href=http://www.hiayh.org>American Youth Hostels</a>, nonprofit organization dedicated to making travel possible for those on a budget through its low-cost, self-service network of accommodations</li>
<li><a href=http://www.ic.org>Intentional Communities</a>, an organizational network thingy of communities around the country</li>
</ul>
<p>
And I'm excited!!!!

Today I started my book called <em>ROB'S RUNES</em> in which I intend to record any consultations I make with my runes.
