<p class=date>Saturday 25 October 1997</p>

<p>
This day the LRY helped the Schweitzer Club with building their haunted house for the younger kids at church! Normally this project belongs to the Schweitzer Club, but they have only a few members this year and asked for our help.
<p>
My task included bringing big boxes for building whatever they wanted to build. Wende had brought a large box from work a few days previously, which stood grandly in our living room until Saturday morning.<br>
In the past, we've been able to find tons of boxes at her work, but not this day. Almost all the boxes were smushed and bailed for recycling.  Doh!! There were a couple of long panels of cardboard, so we grabbed those. We also grabbed one big huge thick box that probably wasn't meant to be recycled just yet.
<p>
Wende stayed at work cause she had to work, and I drove our box collection back home to get everything else ready for the day.
<p>
As I was sending <a href="/writing/old/fgnet/index.html">The Feel Good Net</a>, Jon W called and indicated he hadn't gotten quite as much completed with the Construct-O-Con Registration forms as he wanted.
<p>
No problem! We went to Kinko's with what he had completed, and totally blatantly used the OKC Rally Registration form as our form. We got the whole thing completed and all good in about 25 minutes.  Awesome.
<p>
Drove to the church, and in a huge collision of cardboard, 3 mil plastic, staple guns, weird lights and youth, they built a haunted house. 
<p>
The greatest part is the youth design it, the youth direct the creation, the youth are in charge of their own project! I got to crawl inside a big box and simply watch it unfold.
<p>
At around 5 or 6 in the pm, the haunted house was declared complete. We chilled and chilled for a while, waiting for a couple youth to return from whatever they had to do, and decided what to do the rest of the night.
<p>
Finally, it was Sarah L, Paul R, Laura M, Adam W, Wende and I who went to 59 Diner to munch before we cruised out to The Haunted Hotel. Unfortunately, Laura began to feel blechy and had to call her parental units to come pick her up. I finished my Diner Salad and went outside with her to wait. We intended good health for her, and hoped she'd be able to come see us at church the next day.
<p>
The rest of us drove to Haunted Hotel, but the line was like 5 million people and we were all "no way!" and rented <em>The Exorcist</em> instead.
<p>
We got back to the church around 11pm. Sarah had to leave and kT joined us to watch the movie and spend the night. So at this point it was me, Wende, Paul, Adam and kT.
<p>
Paul and Adam watched the movie. I watched it mostly from such an oblique angle that the image was all distorted and really didn't seem quite as scary. kT kinda watched and kinda bounced around the room on warm Dr Pepper energy. Wende did not watch, instead spent her time making bead bracelets.
<p>
kT and I each made a bracelet for one another. I made her a green one and she made me a blue one. I love it.
<p>
Then at 2am (or is it 1am because we set the clock back?) we crashed for the night.
