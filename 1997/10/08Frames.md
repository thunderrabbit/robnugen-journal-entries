Today I added frames to my website! My <a href=../../skate/frame.html>Wild Skating Adventures</a> and <a href=../../gravity/frame.html>Gravity</a> now use frames to let you view them.
<p>
I certainly don't know if it's any better this way, but now I've had practice with making some simple frames, and I'm happy.
<p>
I learned all about how to do it at a great HTML tutorial site: <a href=http://www.htmlgoodies.com>www.htmlgoodies.com</a>!
