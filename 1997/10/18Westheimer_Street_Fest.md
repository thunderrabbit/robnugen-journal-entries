<p>
Today Wende and I had major big fun at the Westheimer Street Festival, a semi-annual gathering of booths, street performers,  bands and crowds of people dressed to be noticed.
<p>
Wende and I went on skates, of course.  The crowd is too thick to do much people surfing, so I did a bit of car surfing down on one end where traffic is all slow and crunchy where they have to exuse themselves off Westheimer.
<p>
The coolest things I saw:
<ul>
<li>A group of three youth, including Andrew L who used to attend the youth group at my church, drumming excellently like mad on hand drums.  They drummed for like 20 minutes, with enough excellence and variety to hold a stable crowd the entire time.</li>
<li>Two people from <a href=http://www.eden.com/~zendik>Zendik Farm</a> a tribal community on 300 acres near Austin. (When I embark on my roadtrip, I will definitely spend some time there.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
There was no "skater thing." Last time the Urban Animals had a joust, and the time before that a group sponsored a street course of ramps and rails and stuff on which good skaters could compete.
<p>
I still had fun car surfing a bit.
