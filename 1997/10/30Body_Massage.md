<p class=date>30 October 1997</p>

<p>
This night I went to Kathy F's to get balanced. Specifically, she worked on my cranial-sacral balance (and I'm still not sure how to spell it) to help get my physical body aligned.
<p>
During the process, my consciousness stayed mostly aware as my physical body took a nap. I love that state of awareness! (I still believe that state is one step away from etheric projection; I'll continue practicing.)
<p>
Upon completion, I paged Wende while Kathy and I talked about various excellent books we've read. Wende arrived with halloween colored Oreos which we munched and generally had a yummy good time.
<p>
There's so much I want to read!
