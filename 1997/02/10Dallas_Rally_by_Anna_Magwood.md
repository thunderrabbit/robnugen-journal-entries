<h1>1997 Dallas rally review by Anna Magwood</h1>

My First Rally Experience
<p>
My first rally was Dallas 1997.  <br>
I didn't know quite what to expect, but I had
heard from others that they were a lot of fun.  This was an 
understatement.
<p>
We met at our church at about 6:15 and were on the road by 6:30.
Originally we were taking 6 to 8 people.  But in the end, 
there was only me, Meagan Holt, Ben Hatfield, a friend of 
mine from school Brandy Winans, and our
advisor Mark Holt.  We slept for most of the trip, except 
Mark, and arrived at the
church around 10:30.  In the main hall there was loud music, a game of keep
away with a stuffed frog, and dancing.  This, paired with the fact that it
was freezing cold outside, woke us up pretty quickly.
<p> Opening circle included the reading of the rules and general introductions.
About half-way through opening circle Little Rock showed up and joined us.
<p>
 After that we separated into touch groups where we introduced ourselves, talked
about
what workshops there were, and what kind of underwear we had on.  I was sick
that night so I decided to go to sleep early, around 3:00 am.
<p>Saturday morning I felt much better.  Breakfast included:  a couple
different kinds of fruit, multiple cereal choices, and juice.  After
breakfast, the
workshops began.  I went to the symbols workshop and we talked about ancient
and modern symbols.  Then we had lunch which was make-it-yourself
sandwiches.  After lunch I went to the clay workshop where we were given a
big
hunk of clay and told to let our imagination run wild.  I began to work on
something abstract, but  in the end I had a plate, a cup, and something
coming
out of a pot.  Someone gave me a rose they had made.  It was beautiful.  I
was
going to keep it forever, but it got squished in my bag on the way home.
 <p>
 My touch group had dinner prep so I headed for the kitchen.  Dinner was
Mexican food.  My job was to shred lettuce.  Shredding done, I was just
standing
around in the kitchen with some other people when a youth walked up to me and
said that he did not know me, but just saying, "Hi, my name is Dane Dormio",
made him uncomfortable because it was so 'normal.'  So, he introduced himself
in
Spanish and I responded in French.  After we talked a bit he offered me a
stick of
Carefree gum, bubblegum flavor, which I happily accepted.  I had made a
friend.
<p>By the time everything was ready to eat, a monster line had formed.  But
before the masses could charge the kitchen, the advisors made them all sit
down
in one big circle and they had a dicussion, about rocks I think.  I was in
the kitchen
at the time with about 5 other youths because we didn't want to sit in the
group.
We soon got very hungry, so we just made a couple of tacos for ourselves and
had a jolly good time.
<p> When dinner was over I wandered into the movie room.  Everyone in there
wanted to watch some Mr. Bean.  This was when the feeling of belonging first
hit
me.  These people were my age and like me.  After a couple Mr. Bean episodes
we decided to switch to some Star Wars.  The Empire Strikes Back was put in
and I watched about 30 minutes of it before I started to get sleepy.  I
didn't want to
go to sleep just yet so I left and just wandered around the church until
someone
snagged me and hauled me to another building for the No Talent-Talent Show.
That was when I learned The Nun Joke, which I have since told to all my
friends.
Overall, the talent show was pretty good with Keith Lawlor winning with
"Giraffe".
 <p>Immedately following the show was worship.  I felt so happy and secure
then.  I didn't quite know what I was feeling.  I only knew that I was in
shock.  A
sort of happy, excited, wonderful state of shock.  These teens were like me,
we
had the same kind of thoughts, ideas, and feelings.  All these years I had
been
thinking that I was alone with no one to really understand me.  My parents
understood me, but your parents aren't your peers.  Being accepted and loved
by
your peers is very different than being accepted and loved by your parents.
<p>The next morning we cleaned up the church and had breakfast.  Closing
circle had interesting readings about Zion.  Then we sang some songs I didn't
know and Bish-Bish which I had heard before.  It was great.  Bish-Bish always
gives me a rush.  Then suddenly everyone was saying good-bye.  Dane picked me
up from behind and gave me a hug.
<p>The ride home was quiet except for the ever present Beatles music, which
rocked.  I drifted between sleep and deep thoughts about what had happened
that
weekend.  I was so incredibly happy that I smiled nearly the whole way home
and
for days after that.  I have never done that before and it made me feel so
good that
I smiled even more.  The change that happened in me was not just something
inside my mind.  My friends noticed it too.  I am hardly ever shy anymore.  I
have
become more active in my classes and I voice my opinion much more.
<p>I love you all and I don't know what I'll do next year when I have to
graduate.  I hope I will be prepared for it because right now a month apart
seems
just too damn long to be away from your family.
