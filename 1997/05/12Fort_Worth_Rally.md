<h1>1997 Fort Worth rally review by Rob</h1>

<hr>
Driving up from Houston in my truck were just Cathy Saur and 
myself.<br>
The entire way up there we talked about what is most important 
in the world.  The discussion resulted 
in us defining 4 types of love:<p>
<ol>
<li> Love, the emotion, that people have when they fall in love 
with other people.  This is the type of love people usually mean
 when they say, "I love you."</li>
<li> Love, the non-love, when people love things that are 
inanimate.  "I love that dress!"  "I love that picture!"  
"I love to ski."</li>
<li> Love, the instinct, which all humans intrinsically have for
 all other humans.</li>
<li> And Rally Love, that amazing thing that allows us to form 
greater relationships in one weekend than in a whole semester in school.   Incredible!</li>
</ol>
I believe the most important thing in the world is to love yourself and everyone else, and I think the 
perfect life for me would be to "walk the earth" like Jules in Pulp Fiction and love so many people that I wouldn't need money to live- just be a bum, but not begging for money, just being helpful and
getting a place to sleep in return.      <br>
Really.  That would be cool.<p>
We drove the entire way nonstop once we got out of Houston rush hour traffic.<p>
Walked into the rally and upon seeing my short short haircut (1/8th inch all over), James Meine said,
"can I lick it?"   I said sure....  Rally Love.<p>
We played hackysack & skateboarded around the big flat hard concrete sanctuary, after playing with a weird plus-shape green flying foam thing until one of its arms was ripped off.   I got out my Ballzack, basically a big cloth beach ball.  We knocked it around for quite a while and soon developed a game we called Deadball.  Essentially the same rules as Ultimate.  We played that until dog tired 5:30AM and I lay down and slept about 30 minutes in the movie room, where they were watching <em>Holy Grail</em>.  I got back up and played hackysack with the few remaining players.  I did better than usual, though we were all obviously tired.  We played Deadball again as the sun was coming up.  At 7AM or so I slept 2 hours until breakfast at 9.<p>
Adam Lock and I went outside and tossed the frisbee around and practiced various types of throws.  After a couple other people came out, I went in to check the schedule and talked to Bernest Cain, Melissa's dad, and then went to the Sexuality Workshop.
The workshop was cool; I learned that babies must be lovingly touched or they will die.  Wow.<p>
During lunch I sat with Gabe Rendon and Mike Noyse and asked them about Wu-Tang Clan, to understand what/why/whatever about the "lyrics" describing graphic ways of torturing people.  I decided that it can be seen as a form of humor in that it's exaggerating stupid hurtful thing people have done.  And as a game to see who can gross the other out.   hmm.<p>
After that, we got a group together and played Ultimate out in the field.  It was super great fun.  I hope the youth had as much fun as I.  The game ended as PM workshops started.<p>   I attended the workshop that showed the <em>Powers of Ten</em> video and then had discussion afterward.  Great discussion afterward about "what kind of a difference can we make at this particular magnitude of life?" and  "why life anyway?"  or "why sentience and self awarness?" and we talked about the structure of the universe.  Pretty interesting stuff.     I described briefly the experiences of one man who has had 2 near death experiences, and how he believes the most important thing in the world is for each individual to be responsible for his or her own actions.<p>
Soon after the workshop, I described to Gavin, et. al. the flatland universe big bang, and how the book <em>Stalking the Wild Pendulum</em> described the universe as continuously big banging and continuously big crunching.  (Don't worry; it didn't make any more sense when I described it than as I'm typing it here.)<p>
Then we cut about 4 variations of mobius strips with 1/2, 1, and 1&1/2 twists.  Cool.<p>
I talked to Aisha, who has been to 9 SWUUSIs but this was her first rally.  She said she felt a bit out of place, so I asked if she would play a game if I got one started.  She would, so I did.<br>
We played the Zoo Game and it degenerated to a slow motion version  of the game with people all playing really slowly, taunting the other players and making the game suck.  I singled out 1 person as slowness instigator and I asked him privately to play more enthusiastically- to actually run and try to play...  He did better and that helped but people were still playing apathetically...<p>
My belief is that by playing enthusiastically, the game thrives; it becomes more enjoyable for all involved.  By playing the other way, people were actually sucking energy out of the game and out of the other players (read <em>Celestine Prophecy</em> to see what I'm talking about).<p>
Unfortunately, the only way I knew to explain this was to adamantly tell people "play better, play harder blah blah blah" and then (more unfortunate) for me to RUN and play to the point it was too hard for some players, and made at least one not want to play.   This was not working out at all and I didn't know what to do.    Fortunately, "dinner is ready!" was shouted into the room, and everyone vanished, except for me; I collapsed onto the comforting cold concrete floor to recover some energy.<p>
In the dinner line, I asked a few people if I played too hard.  
I had, so next time we play, I will explain logically why we 
might want to play passionately instead of otherwise.  
(Zoo Gamers, be ready!)<p>
During dinner we had the YAC candidates run for election and I 
ran for the adult position, and I got it!  My term officially 
starts at SWUUSI this year.  Yayyy!!<p>
After dinner I talked with other adults who had congregated at 
one table and told them about the web page, and we brainstormed 
stuff to put on it.<p>
Then we had the dance, then the YAC transfer of 
power/description of accomplishments meeting, then the talent 
show<p>
Much to my pleasant surprise, when I jokingly started the talent show with the Fuck You Clown Joke, everyone was like, "yeah yeah!! tell it!"   So I did.  Tera Little apparently hadn't heard it before and said, "that's *terrible*!" when I sat down.<p>
Then Kristian Scott, Dane Dormio, and I performed "Dead Puppies." 
  Dane sang, Kristian fingered the chords on the guitar, and I 
strummed the guitar and laughed because it truly was terrible.  
We had great fun, though.<p>
Then Gabe Rendon and Mike Noyse performed with Gabe doing beat 
box and Mike rapping and I was envious at how well Gabe can 
beatbox and I could practically hear the deep mega low ultra 
bass woofers and hear and see the scratch as they danced around 
the stage and performed so passionately loving and beautifully 
ad libbed the whole thing!  How do they do it???  I would pay 50 
bucks to have it on tape.
(Gabe, Mike, you listenin?)<p>
Then I fell asleep.<p>
Then my first YAC meeting as a YAC member and we decided what 
positions people will have and what overall goals we have for 
YAC this year.<p>
Then Silent Football until 2am or so.  How nice it was to sit 
by Carina Dormio and play nicely instead of always play fighting 
as we had done in the past.<p>
Then Tera Little and I stayed up until 4AM yackin' about life, 
love and everything.   Julie Sexton sat with us, until I was 
literally falling asleep while sitting up.  Time for bed.<p>
Slept until around 7am when the funniest thing was hearing Debe 
Barnes holler in her sleepy voice to someone trying to wake us 
up, "is it clean yet??  Don't wake me up until the church is 
clean!"  That was hilarious.<p>
That morning, I realized that Shawn McDaniel, who went to 
rallies with me back in the good ol' days, had been there the 
whole weekend knowing it was me and just waiting for me to 
realize it.  Wow!!  We swapped emails and reminisced and it was 
great.  <p>
I took a long time hugging everyone, and especially all the 
seniors as everybody was leaving.  I will miss them all.  <p>
Drove home and Cathy slept the entire way.  I slept for 30 
minutes after we arrived at the church until her parents got 
there and knocked on the truck window.  Got home and slept.<p>
Great rally.<p>
With Love<br>
