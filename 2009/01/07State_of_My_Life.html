<li><p>Fred and I are in Manboo internet cafe in Shibuya.  It's our second time here, and T minus 6
days until he heads home.</p></li>

<li><p>Foodwise, we've been to The Pink Cow, Sweets Paradise, CoCo Curry near Motosumiyoshi station,
a cafe even closer to Motosumiyoshi station, and several home-cooked meals at home, generally cooked
by Fred or Ami.</p></li>

<li><p>Fred has been diligently working on his PhD homework, getting his brain wrapped around his
massive, cryptically written FORTRAN program that he inherited as a way to solve for X where X is a
matrix of points around a ring of invertibrate tubes or something.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been enjoying being lazy for the time we've been together, though parts of me thinks
I've been tooo lazy; my room has become messier overall; I haven't written an End of Year Rob Update
(though I started
a <a href="/journal.pl?type=all&date=2008/12/22#ROB_Update_December_2008">Rob Update on 22
December</a>); I haven't done much on MT3.</p>

<p>But I have been meditative more than once in the past week; enjoyed chatting with Ami some;
enjoyed chatting with Fred a lot; signed up for a tumblr account
(<a href="http://thunderrabbit.tumblr.com/">Rob Nugen on Tumblr</a>), and worked on the Flash game
that Tariq and I have been doing for several weeks (8?)</p>

<p>Oh, and I finished Colleen's painting!</p></li>

<li><p>I'll be headed to Kagoshima on Tuesday.  At the same time, Fred will be leaving for Narita,
then arriving in Atlanta before he leaves.  In Kagoshima, I'll be chillin' for two weeks in the
same clinic where I chilled in February, but this time for 30 more 万円, so that's nice.</p></li>

<li><p>After that, I'll have the equivalent money of 6 months at my old job, so I'll put that
toward taking intensive Japanese lessons, and finally spend some time to learn this language.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'll start writing in my mixi account at that point.  Proabably haven't written in it
for a year.</p>/li>

<li><p>I really like Colleen's painting, and I want to scan it at a high DPI and make some posters
of it.  Oh, and while I'm in Kagoshima, I plant to work on several pieces during my free time
there.</p></li>

<li><p>I posted on Facebook a note about Israel destroying the shit out of civilians in Gaza.
Really not happy about them doing that, and have visualized world peace in that zone.  Peace, man.
Peace.</p>

<p>Watched a <a href="http://www.brasschecktv.com/page/517.html">snippet from _Why We Fight_ by
BrasscheckTV</a>. I've seen the whole video before, and this abbreviated version is just 10
minutes, so check it out.</p></li>

<li><p>going to get some more hot chocolate now.</p></li>

<li><p>Just read about twitter getting their admin site hacked because of a terrible password.  I
hereby recommend <a href="http://supergenpass.com/">SuperGenPass</a> for creating passwords for
websites.  It hashes your master password with the site domain to create a strong unique password
for each domain you visit.</p></li>

<li><p>Ah. I'm reminded that Fred and I wanted to sort out a way to use GPG or PGP to send secured
messages to each other.</p></li>
