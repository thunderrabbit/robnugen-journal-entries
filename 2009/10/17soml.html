<b>the question and answer to what is up</b>

I've been workin' 9 to 7pm most days for the past couple weeks..  doing website+database
programming, and learning a lot about front end website programming while I'm at it.  Everything
we're writing is in PHP + Mootools, which allows "Web 2.0" functionality pretty easily.

In other news, I'm slowly (!) writing in Python a set of indices that may be come my new journal
indexer (to work alongside journal.pl (written in Perl at <a href="http://robnugen.com/journal.pl">http://robnugen.com/journal.pl</a>)
Also learning some code management software called git.

I recently brought my awesome bicycle from my old apartment to the house where I'm
living/camping-in-the-living-room now.  My bike's name is TJ Bike, with whom I rode from Tokyo,
through Kobe, around Kyoto, and almost back in 2006.  I should make a page for him in my wiki.  A
few pics are online
<a href="http://robnugen.com/images/travel/tjbike/kyoto2006/almost_finished/Page3_no_blood.shtml">http://robnugen.com/images/travel/tjbike/kyoto2006/almost_finished/Page3_no_blood.shtml</a> and nearby
pages (remove "_no_blood" to see pics from *during* my surgery).  ((( but that's all old old news
you may have seen before )))

Coming soon to an apartment in Tokyo, I'll be the guest artist at a little art show thing on 31
October to which my aspiring-art-dealer friend Rimi has invited me to show some art and speak for
about 45 minutes on art.  Wow!

Just today I finished a series of 6 pieces to sorta show a thought process indicative of my
brainwaves when I paint/draw.  Scans of them are online at a URL available via
<a href="http://art.robnugen.com/outlines">http://art.robnugen.com/outlines</a> (I think).

Still enjoying living near the beach in Chigasaki with my friend Soness.

What's up with you?
    - Rob!
