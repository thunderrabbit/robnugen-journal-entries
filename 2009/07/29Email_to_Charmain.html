Charmain!!

Aight, I am composing this while offline, and now that you've helped us switch from asking "what's
up wit' you???" to actually *answering*, I hope we can switch from FB to "real" email, just because
my brain likes to have all the important bits in one place.

&gt; It's hard to sum up the past, ooooh, 14 years or so, in a couple
&gt; of sentences but you did a really nice job of that!  ;-)

I actually have no idea what I wrote as a summary, but here's a start of more than a couple
sentences (I'll have to change trains before I finish).

I ended up in Japan after deciding I wanted to learn a &quot;difficult&quot; language, one with
letters I didn't know how to pronounce.  I also wanted a &quot;safe&quot; country with fresh water
and stable government.  With my limited world knowledge and even less research, I came up with
Japan.  Sometimes I wish I had chosen China or an Arabic speaking country, but I don't really want
to start over again now.


&gt; I'm not really surprised you live in a place where, rumor has it, they prefer you remove your shoes.

Yah, we get to take off shoes inside, but I want to take them off *outside*!!  Now that I live near
the beach, I've been doing that; I'm just wearing flipflops today, but I'm getting way ahead of my
14 year biomary (biography-summary)

Went to UH for 5 happily barefoot years, during which I chased a lot of girls and studied enough to
get a 2.? GPA overall and a Comp Science degree to boot.

Got engaged to a lovely woman named Wende, bought a house with her, then realized I wouldn't be
happy if I settled so soon, and told her I had to go.  Super huge blessings to her for being so
understanding!  I'm glad to hear she's married with babies now.  Perhaps next lifetime we'll
reconnect.

Before going to Japan, I figured I should see my own country so I drove around the US 11,000 miles
in two road trips from my new base in Dallas at my lovely g/f janette's house.

Ah shipes; my station has arrived.  er, we have arrived at the station.

Okay, I'm going to interrupt this biomary for a little rant.  I'm pissed that I have to go through
useless security checkpoint including taking off my belt, my computer out of my backpack, and having
my *water* examined because some arrogant motherfuckers destroyed the World Trade Center so they
could make big bucks and start wars in middle east.  I'm lookin' at Dick Cheney as the prime suspect
and Larry Silverstein as prime initial benefactor.

Start your research with WTC 7, if you haven't already.

Bah humbug.  I don't want to write anymore.

Okay, it's a few hours and two ice creams later; I can continue writing about the past 14 years.

Um, came to Japan, worked as an &quot;English teacher&quot; (some call it edutainment) for 2 years,
then got to do the most amazing trip in the world: sailing around the world on PB.  Short stops in
each port, but a lot of ports!  The itinerary is on my website somewhere...

Met many amazing people including a woman who said she was from Palestine.  I was like, &quot;yeah
I've heard of Pakistan, but never been there,&quot; &quot;Not Pakistan; <em>Palestine</em>.&quot;

So after the PB voyage, I went to Palestine for 6 weeks to see what's the real story between the
Israeli and Palestinian conflict (a whole separate story, but my short version is the Palestinians
are not being treated humanely by the Israeli police-army)

Then went on PB *again*, this time around the world focusing on the southern hemisphere (though we
didn't visit Antarctica, Australia nor New Zealand, all three of which I woulda enjoyed)... we *did*
stop at Easter Island, which is amazingly beautiful!!

Arrived back in Japan with no job, only $200 dollars, my bicycle and a plan to ride from Tokyo to
Kyoto for a 10 day vipassana meditation course.  Did the course (quite difficult, but quite
recommended if you're interested in a silent meditation for 10 days, free of charge) and then rode
my bicycle back toward Tokyo but hit a car a broke my shoulder when I was just one day away from my
goal.

Damn.  Didn't have insurance, so I borrowed money and paid $4000 in medical bills over the next two
years, during which I worked as an English teacher and then as a programmer.

Lost my job in December thanks to badly managed company (that's my story and I'm stickin' to it),
then got a &quot;job&quot; as a lab rat and made $10,000 for a month's hospital stay taking
anti-depressants (which didn't work, btw), after which I started living with my friend Soness near
the beach, and now have a new programming job that starts on Monday.

I've basically skipped all the relationship-side of my life: was engaged to wonderful Wende, but
wasn't ready to settle; then great connection with janette (before and start of Japan) but wasn't
ready to settle, then chaotic relationship with Hitomi in Japan and on PB, then much nicer
relationship with Ami after my bicycle accident, but just recently broke up with her, citing core
value, activity and language differences as unworkable for me.

Now I'm single and reading a book called No More Mr. Nice Guy, which seems to have suggestions for
how I can stop chasing women and be happy just being me.

&gt; Myself, I doubt I can be that concise...

Well, I kept it pretty short above; you can waste a lot of time reading all the details starting at
http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=all&amp;date=1988/08/23 to get caught up since high
school.

&gt; I was in Alaska for 9 of those years... it's great there... during the summer.  I threaten to
move back every once in awhile, although I don't REALLY want to endure 50 below EVER again!

OMG 50 below would be a nightmare for me... Perhaps for like 5 minutes it would be a fun novelty,
but man... 9 years????  In which city?  Why?  PB stopped in a city on the southern coast of Alaska,
though I can't remember the name at the moment.

&gt; I'm single, well, sorta... "it's complicated" is probably a better description...
&gt; but content with the un-relationship, as I like to call it, that I'm in.

Good to hear!  Where did you meet this mysterious shadow?

&gt; Currently, I work at Dow chemical as a lab tech, but I'm about to go back to college this fall
Sounds great!  I'm considering going back to school; for me it would be a school called Clairvision,
which says it helps raise the voltage of consciousness.  Meditation, and awareness of subtle
energies around us.


&gt; I'm gonna go try out Reflexion since you've got my curiosity up now...

Cool!  Do you have an iPhone to play reflexion?  Either way, you should make some levels and tell me
what they're called so I can test them out for you!

   Love Love
    - Rob!
