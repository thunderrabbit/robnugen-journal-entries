<p>I now hereby declare &quot;sedimail&quot; to mean the stack of emails in one's inbox, that
accumulate over time, hiding the older messages from view.</p>

How in the where are you?

I'm still in Tokyo, and have recently sent out a Rob Update, though I
don't know if you were on the list.
<a href="/journal.pl?type=all&date=2009/04/16#poke_poke_soml">http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=all&date=2009/04/16#poke_poke_soml</a>

Not sure if you still use this email address.

I wish you all the best of the best of the best.

Your email has been chillin' in my inbox, buried by miles of sediment.
 Maybe sedimail is a new term we can use.

&gt; Good Evening Rob Nugen...
&gt; The unofficial sanctions began after the election of the Hamas government.
&gt; The EU and US won't pay the aid normally paid to the PA because they are a
&gt; "terrorist organisation", for the same reason Israel is holding back tax
&gt; payments to the PA. So....all the work normally done by the state and it's
&gt; employees (including health, education, sanitation etc) isn't funded...there
&gt; are a couple of articles below that sum up the situation here pretty well!

&gt; The year has indeed flown by....a year ago I was a full time social worker
&gt; with a mortgage...now I'm an unemployed-homeless-activist-bum. Social
&gt; mobility eh?!
&gt; I didn't get one question when coming in this year...and it's my third
&gt; time...i'm sure you get back in if you want to...
&gt;
&gt; I hope you are well in...Tokyo(?), doing exciting things along with the
&gt; daily routine.
&gt;
&gt; Oh, so far so good on the not getting eaten during Ramadan front!

&gt; &gt; HI cutie pie
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I like to feel some sort of connection; I can visualize most of the
&gt; &gt; places you described in your message.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Did you get eaten at Ramadan? I sure hope not, cause then this email
&gt; &gt; would be wasted!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So ... amazing to think that it's been a year since I was there.
&gt; &gt; Fucking hell that was a quick year. Lots of times I want to go back,
&gt; &gt; but I don't because I know I would have to get to work and really do
&gt; &gt; something, not just be a tourist. I bet it would be a trick to get
&gt; &gt; back into the country, as well.

&gt; &gt; I don't really know the story about international community holding
&gt; &gt; back funds which subsequently has put a halt in the Nablus economy,
&gt; &gt; save for IOUs. If you have time, I could read a few links on that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Love and Love
&gt; &gt; - Rob
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; thank you for following your dream. You're an inspiration to me and
&gt; &gt; others. (smooch)
