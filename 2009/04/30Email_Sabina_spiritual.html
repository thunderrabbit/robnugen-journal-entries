&gt; And there are so many unanswered questions! What would a soul be made of,
&gt; exactly? If simply pure energy, then what could hold it together? Why
&gt; doesn't it dissipate into the environment? And if something else, why hasn't
&gt; somebody identified the substance?

If the soul is non-physical, these questions can't actually be applied
to it in our conventional way of thinking.

i.e. I have no idea!


&gt; What system would ensure that the allotting of bodies to souls goes smoothly?
Good question!

&gt; And why would souls need bodies in the first place?
So they can experience separation, physical sensations..  I think
basically coming into physical bodies is a type of growth process for
souls to find out who they are.

&gt; They can clearly function on
&gt; their own, as indicated by their time spent between human bodies. And why do
&gt; souls need to come into the human world at all? If they do have this other
&gt; realm, why not stay there? It's peaceful, nobody has to pay taxes, from what
&gt; I hear everyone lives in harmony... So why ditch it for this comparative
&gt; hellhole?

I like "nobody has to pay taxes..."  hahahaha  you think souls don't pay taxes??

Oh wait, you're right.  I'm sure they don't.

j/k..

Seriously, um, basically because such an existence of pure peace all
the time would be *boring*.


&gt; I just don't buy that experience on the human world would really
&gt; enhance one's spiritual growth. It seems to me that any soul who left their
&gt; peaceful, harmonious realm for the earth would in fact be regressing
&gt; spiritually during the time they spend here.

I think it's easy to be all loving and all harmony when one is
connected to everything one needs.

But to be loving toward others when one is in hell... that's
challenging.  To achieve that requires magnificent spiritual growth.

&gt; I also see no way for the
&gt; souls, soul realm, and mechanisms for linking souls to bodies to have been
&gt; created.

This is another genre of good questions.

In Deepak Chopra's book _Quantum Healing_, he points out that we can't
find an interface between non-physical thoughts and physical results.
As I'm typing, what translates my thoughts into keystrokes on the
keyboard?  We can point to physical processes of muscle contraction
after nerve impulses after brain impulse after ... what exactly?

From Sabina's point of view, the brain is a self-contained system
which has thoughts and makes the body do things.

Are thoughts / thinking / consciousness the result of atom alignment?
I think not, but you're right; it raises a lot of questions that I
can't answer yet.

Back in the day, I had an interesting experience, dreaming that I was
doing some gymnastics (I was a gymnast during high school and some in
college).  I was showing off my flexibility with my face down flat
against my knees.  I realized after a bit "I can't do this in real
life; I must be dreaming!" and then as I was slightly waking up, I
realized through proprioception (*) that my legs _*really were*_
folded back over my head in a way that made no sense for a sleeping
body.

(*) Though I had heard it before, I had to look up this word with a
reverse dictionary.

I internally scanned all my parts, and everything added up correctly,
and everything agreed my legs were folded over my head.  I thought
"hmmm I'm halfway out of my body" and tried to lift/float/fly myself
the rest of the way out, and got my entire body out of my body except
for my head.  I tried several times, and eventually moved my physical
jaw, thinking that maybe I was clenching my teeth.  That motion
triggered the beginning of the end, and my body slowly floated down
and reconnected with my physical body.

I gently lay there for several moments, doing more internal scans and
the carefully remembering the whole experience so I could write it
down.  It's somewhere in one of my journals, perhaps even online.
(hmmm this includes a reference to the event, but I don't find the
original <a href="/journal.pl?type=all&date=2002/08/02#Religion">http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=all&date=2002/08/02#Religion</a>)

After that experience, I *knew* that we are more than just our
physical bodies.  I had existed outside my physical body.


&gt; But if reincarnation does exists, and operates by some mechanism beyond my
&gt; comprehension, I still wonder why it exists. Why would a soul, which has the
&gt; clear advantage over the human body, sacrifice its freedom for an existence
&gt; where it is essentially animating a dead cluster of cells? The whole general
&gt; concept of reincarnation seems very illogical to me. How can reincarnation
&gt; be reconciled with evolution? The shaky nature of the whole theory makes me

Perhaps souls only start to inhabit physical bodies once the physical
bodies are developed enough to be self aware.

&gt; what would happen as the
&gt; world's population continues to grow at an ever-increasing rate? Would we
&gt; eventually run out of souls to fill bodies?)

The best answer I know for this one is another mind-blower:  Time
doesn't exist in the way we experience it.  We experience time as a
never-ending series of events, cause and effect, eggs and chickens,
thoughts and keystrokes.  But the reality is that everything that ever
was,is,will be exists in the infinite now.

Speaking of now,

Now, I can't get my brain around this one really at all, but it's the
answer I keep hearing from people who are far more spiritually
advanced and experienced than me.


&gt; So there you have it. I can't prove reincarnation doesn't exist. I can't
&gt; even prove it to myself. But I find the thought of it illogical and
&gt; unfounded in any branch of modern science.

What is modern science?   What does it look for?

&gt; Anyway, I'm still curious about why you believe in reincarnation and how you
&gt; first got into it. You said you originally started meditating to find
&gt; evidence of past lives. So you became interested in reincarnation and then
&gt; went looking for proof. What about it convinced you to try and look for your
&gt; own past lives?

It started with the idea of lucid dreaming, and that same research
quickly showed me the concept of astral travel.  I thought, "what an
amazing way to learn; to actually be *out* of Flatland.." and from
there, past lives and future lives and remote viewing, etc etc.

&gt; Anyway, please tell me what you think of my thoughts. I would love to hear
&gt; any criticism you had of them. I think I often get stuck in my own mindsets
&gt; and don't realize that they are faulty.

"The search for truth is never faulty."
