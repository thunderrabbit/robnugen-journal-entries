<p>And now, thought I should be in bed 3+ hours ago, I'm testing putting a second set of comments on the same page, but for a different entry.  How will this be handled?</p>

<div class="js-kit-comments" path="/journal/2009/03/20/second_instance_of_comment_on_page"> permalink="http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=all&date=2009/03/20#second_instance_of_comment_on_page"></div>

<p>Hmmm.  Doesn't work.  Er, the comments are the same on both instances (as would be expected since they are on the same URI.</p>

<p>Ohhhhh I didn't set the permalink on the first one.  I'll set it on both that one and this one.  BRB.</p>

<p>permalink attribute didn't do it, but the <a href="http://wiki.js-kit.com/Admin-Guide#Path">path attribute</a> did it.</p>
