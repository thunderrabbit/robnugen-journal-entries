<p class=date>6:54am Tuesday 17 August 1999</p>

<p>Today I have jury duty.  The summons came by mail to my apartment while I was in Iowa.  When I saw the summons, I was like, "uh oh- I hope I didn't miss it!"

<p>I didn't miss it.  But I did miss the fact that I am scheduled for KTRU on the same day.  Doh!  I caught this too late and requested a sub only a couple days ago.  I dunno what's going to happen.

<p>Maybe the station will be off the air for 3 hours.  Maybe I can shout, "guilty!" and be removed from the case.

<p>I'll try to call some DJs today at a more decent hour.
