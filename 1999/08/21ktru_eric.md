<p class=date>15:46 Saturday 21 August 1999</p>

<p>Last night (and every Friday night) KTRU broadcast MK Ultra show - 3 hours of live DJs mixing jungle or techno or breakbeat or any basic rave music.  I love the show so I go to watch the DJs spin and basically just think, "wow! [I wonder if I would enjoy spending enough time to get that good?]"

<p>Last night Chris Anderson was spinning; he's big in the Houston rave scene and maybe way bigger than that; I know he's spinning in Santa Fe tonight.

<p>So he's just echelons beyond me in all aspects of the skillz, but I enjoyed watching and talking to him.  All the DJs I've talked to just said, "practice."

<p>Turntables are an integral part of this "practice" so I'm thinking, "where do I get turntables?"

<p>At 12:50am, 10 minutes before the show was to end, Eric arrived to cover his 1 to 4am shift.  This surprised me because I was at the station exactly to cover for him (he had sent an email requesting a sub for his show; I was going to be at the station already, so I said yes).  This surprised him because he hadn't gotten my response to his request.

<p>So we both stayed.

<p>Eric and I had <em>so much <b>fun</b></em> cutting up laughing, cutting up vinyl and CDs, experimenting with sounds and stuff; it was great!

<p>We took turns at the console; encouraging each other, "you're doing great!" and just generally having fun.

<p>I mixed up DJ Silver "Don't Panic" with Francis Dhomont "Scherzo", which simply don't mix at all, but was great fun to experiment.  We'll bring tapes next week to record the fun for later playback.
