<p class=date>6:12am Wednesday 11 August 1999</p>

<p>A couple of nights ago I had a super funny experience!

<p>I went to my dad's house to borrow some dollars (that's a different story) at about 11:30pm.  It was late, so I pretty much left by 11:45pm.

<p>The stars were beautiful above, reminding me of my recent two weeks in Iowa, where I spent several hours just looking up at the stars.  I was kinda tired, so I decided to take a moment to lay down and stargaze in front of my dad's house.

<p>My dad lives at the end of a street about 45 minutes north of Houston.  No traffic or lights or anything.  So I parked my car on the street (just in case some car came down, they would see my car and not squish me) and lay down in the street in front of it.

<p>I chose the street to keep grass-dwelling insects off me and it offers a wide view of the sky.

<p>Watching the stars, thinking of Iowa, I fell asleep.

<p>[dramatic pause]

<p>I woke suddenly when a guy was shining a flashlight in my face, his truck with lights on idling nearby.  He asked "where are you from?"

<p>My brain was still in Iowa, so I articulated clearly, "Houston, Texas."

<p>"What? You from around here?"

<p>"No, I am really from Houston Texas."

<p>"What's your name?"

<p>"Rob Nugen."

<p>"This is your end of the street?"

<p>"What?  I'm from Houston."

<p>At this moment, my brain suddenly realized I was not in Iowa.  But I couldn't figure out where I was!  The flashlight effectively blinded me from seeing my surroundings.

<p>"This is your dad's house?" he asked.  "Won't he let you in?"

<p>Recognition washed over me.  Oh yeah!  But why was I here?

<p>"Wait.  I've been in Iowa for two weeks, so I thought I was still there.  Okay, this is a true story:"

<p>I told him I had just been to Iowa, came to my dad's, saw him, left, saw the stars, fell asleep, and here I was.

<p>"Well that's okay, just so long as you weren't hurt or anything. I drive up and see some body lying in the road..."

<p>Turns out the man is my dad's neighbor and a sherrif - type person driving around the area on his normal patrol.  Funny funny funny!!
