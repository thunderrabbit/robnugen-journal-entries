<p class=date>11:45pm Tuesday 17 August 1999</p>

<p>Skated from TX art Supply down to Herrman Park around by medical center around rice University.  Oh- I zipped down the hill by Miller Outdoor Theater twice and around Rice and got ice cream at Walgreens in Rice Village area. and I met Gwen and Kelly and Darwin ("Like Charles") and Roberta and then skated back toward my house along Hazard hauling ass and <font size="+1">BLUH LAM</font> I hit sand and my skates stopped and I fell <em>bang</em> on the sandy asphalt almost into a parked car.  Ow knocked the wind outta me and I rested for a sec.  Jeff waited there with me as others continued on (with my frisbee that I dropped in the process).  Caught up with the group and got my disk and said bye and broke off to say HI to Jennifer at The Mad Potter.  Chilled and talk talked about her life a lot and she invited me to go swim at her house.  Yes.

<p>Swim was fun, watched Tarantula the kitten cutely play in the living room, climbing all over the couches.  Hugged and I went home.
