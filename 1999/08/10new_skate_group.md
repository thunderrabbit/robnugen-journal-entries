<p class=date>10 August 1999</p>

<p>Last night I went skating with a group called Inline Swine.  Far as I can tell, they don't associate themselves with the name so much as associating themselves with, "we meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8pm at Texas Art Supply."

<p>I found the group while skating alone downtown 3 weeks ago.  They were about a block away so I caught up with them. I discovered they were cool and they skate regularly so I may hook up with this group regularly!

<p>Last night (back to the story) we skated about mmmm 12 miles?  Through lots of places I wouldn't go normally, simply because I didn't know they existed, or wouldn't feel safe by myself.  (mom, please note this example of common sense)

<p>Skate skate skated from montrose and Fairview, down to Waugh, west along Memorial, then north through some back-ass streets until we crossed over I-10. As we were crossing this narrow bridge (it did have walls and a fence-cage over it, I waved and waved at the traffic!!  "Hey!  Flash your lights!!!!" for about 2 minutes and not a single car flashed its lights.  Not that they could hear me, but c'mon some kind of acknowledgement is in order...  maybe a light tap on the horn or wave a hand out the window... something! Not this time.

<p>On and on east across TC Jester and then stopped at Durham and 11th street in the Heights for drinks at a convenience store.  I was glad to stop.  I hadn't really skate-exerted myself that much in quite a while, plus I started out the night with kinda ripped up wheels on my right skate.  The back center wheel (inline skates) was shredded to the point of being useless.  Kinda like when a truck tire on the highway shreds, long strips of rubber peel off, I peeled off about 1 & 1/2 pi worth of tread from my wheel hub.  (That's 270 degrees worth. (That's 75%.  (That is, my wheel was useless for skating.)))

<p>Scott said it looked to him like my front wheel on the same skate was going to shred next.  Scott and Jeff and someone else offered me some hand-me-down wheels once we got back.  I absolutely accepted.  (If I could make it back.)

<p>Through more back streets east of Shepherd as we headed back toward downtown, my remaining wheels seemed to work fine.  Back over I-10 on some street I waved at cars, and again got no response.  Hmpf.

<p>Then we did more and more and more skating in a generally going-back type of manner.  Crossed over Memorial on Sawyer, which is kinda cool because Sawyer forms a nice hill over Memorial, allowing for a quick zip down the hill after skating up.

<p>Got back to Texas Art Supply and was offered some wheels by Scott.  I thanked him profusely and said bye to all my new friends and skated home.  Put on the new wheels and I'm excited about trying them out on Thursday!!
