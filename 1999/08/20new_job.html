<p>Awesome!

<p>Some days ago, my friend Brian called me to see if I was interested, or if I knew of anyone who might be interested, in replacing him in his current job.

<p>He described the requirements and stuff, and at first I was like, um um..  maybe but probably not.  In continuing to talk with him, that thinking shifted to more like, maybe yes!

<p>I went to visit the place (5 minutes from my house) on Wednesday afternoon for a preliminary interview. I enjoyed the whole atmosphere of the place: friendly people wearing casual clothing in a homey environment.  Posters on the walls, pictures of kids, a bucket of Super Bubble gum on the table..  Definitely my kind of place!  I met Carla the president of the company who queried me about my background and interests and everything.  We were both enthusiastic at the end of that interview.  I still needed to meet with Kevin, who wasn't there at the time.

<p>Met with Kevin and Carla today and everything is super double plus good, but from their point of view, almost too good. They haven't interviewed anyone else, or even looked for anyone else.  Brian gave his one month notice, called me and I was there the next day.

<p>So Kevin and Carla will talk about it over lunch, and I'm here chillin' at home happily expecting the best.
