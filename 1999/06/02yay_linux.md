<p>Yay!

<p>After pretty much working on it all day, I got my linux box up and running ppp, I downloaded netscape, installed it, created user accounts for myself and Wende, and all is great!!

<p>I've even customized things a bit more this time around (as opposed to last time I had linux on my machine) making it easier to set up new accounts and stuff.  I'm happy.

<p>I had two major problems with getting ppp to work.  First, the modem I had purchased was a PNP for Windows and it hadn't a Prayer on linux.  I returned the modem and reconfigured the jumpers to make it /dev/cua2  (COM3 in DOS/Win terminology) and it worked.  ppp still didn't work though..  After a lot of poking around, I finally went through the book step by step.  Turns out I had forgotten to make one of the scripts an executable script. That fixed it and ppp now works on linux!

<p>I was therefore able to finger and talk my brother's account, but he didn't answer.

<p>I downloaded netscape 4.08 (4.51 was available, but I wasn't impressed with 4.51 on Win; so I chose not to try it on linux) and that's what I'm using now for this entry!

<p>My intention is to ween myself off of Windows and Microsoft stuff entirely.  I'll keep the old box for a while, but for internet stuff I'm pretty much on linux now for good.  I still have my Quicken stuff on my other machine..  is Quicken available for linux?

<p>So that's it.  I'm quite pleased with myself for getting it all to work; pleased with linux for being a free operating system (and one that is stable) and just plain pleased.
