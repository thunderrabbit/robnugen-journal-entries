<p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>

<p><ol>

<p><li>I have reviewed 48 CDs for KTRU, many of them this semester!  I like being able to listen and shout in my mind, "I reviewed that!!"    "Review" in this context means listen to the CD to see if it's broadcastable by KTRU standards. We rate the songs on a 5 point scale basically and DJs know what's good on the CD before they've ever heard it or even heard of it. I usually randomly grab CDs I've never heard and play them when I'm there.</li>

<p><li>A couple nights ago while talking to my dad he was all, "if you choose to attend USM, I'll help pay for tuition.  There is a 1/2 tuition scholarship available for first year students, so you could have your first year tuition paid.   ....  if you drop out, you'll owe me the money back."

<p>Wow.

<p>USM is Univeristy of Santa Monica, where he received his masters in Spiritual Psycology with and emphasis in consciousness, health and healing. I have felt myself pulled in that direction-ish.</li>

<p><li>I was dating someone until... Monday night I guess.  Now we are broken up.  It didn't happen in one swoop; she was distant over the weekend, I called her on it, and she said "I have 
been feeling weird about us lately, like I'm not getting what I need from our relationship."

<p>I was basically, "okay," and "I'm glad you told me."  When I said, "maybe we should just be friends," she said "okay" as soon as I uttered "friends."  Fair enough.

<p>Oddly, I felt a sort of positive surge of energy, like I had been pushing my energy toward her to try to draw her to me maybe.  When I recognized it was over, my energy came back and I felt better. Hmm. Nice.</li>

<p><li>In a subsequent conversation with a friend of mine, I described the afforementioned events and five years of my relationship history. The question came back to me, "let me get this straight: you've been in 'relationship' with someone for essentially all of your adult life?"

<p>That hit me pretty well. "Um, yes." How pathetic of me.  For how long have I been saying, "I need to just *not* date anyone for a while." ??  How long does the while last?  A month at most.  Okay, maybe 3.  Not a year.  Maybe I should try a one month at a time committment to myself. That feels right.</li>

<p><li>I have ordered a new domain. Am I too computer nerdy for my own good?  This will be 3 (technically 4) domains that I own. It should be working in a day or so.  I should have it full of data within a couple weeks.  or more.
</li>

<p><li>On Tuesday night, I went to KTRU to talk with Dennis (DL on the airwaves) who hosts the Hip Hop show every Tuesday night.

<p>Oh oh oh oh and!!!  AND!!!!  I got a ticket to DJ Shadow!  The Music Directors or the Promotions Director or somehow the right people knew that I wanted a ticket and I got a message all, "Rob, there is an extra Zap Mama CD; it's in my box if you want it" from Michael, one of the music directors. (I reviewed and enjoyed our first copy of it.) I was all, Thanks!!! and went to get the CD this morning and BANG there's a DJ Shadow ticket in my CD case!!!  Too too cool.</li>

<p><li>I finished my plate that I've been painting at <a href="http://www.themadpotter.com">The Mad Potter</a>! It's a paint-your-own pottery studio on my street. They provide white pottery and paint. Customers provide creativity and a few dollars and get to take home dishwasher safe, totally useable dish!

<p>I had been working on this plate since 16 August. I estimate I put about 37 hours into it.  It's pretty detailed, - not an image <em>per se</em> but swirly twisty weaving ribbons of lines and dots.

<p>I also did a plate that sports the logo for FSD Data Services on it. I like my job, and wanted my own FSD plate.</li>

<p><li>Tonight is DJ Shadow concert at Numbers!  1.25 hours until doors open.</li>

<p><li>Tomorrow (Friday) begins San Antonio Rally, to which I'll be driving a vanload of youth for 35+ hours of talking, play, music, zany antics, and just about any fun (legal) thing one can think of.</li>
