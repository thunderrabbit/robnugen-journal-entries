<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p class=date>31 October 1999</p>

<p>After dropping off youth at church, I went home, showered, picked up my friend Nancy and went to Molly's Halloween Simpson's party!

<p>Marcel and Kayse were there!  Big hugs to him (and dainty hug to her) Also John, Maggie, Eric, Meredith, Melanie, Steve, Nancy, my Nancy, and Kerry.

<p>Apple bobbing contest was great fun!  Boys against girls and we won barely! Steve was pretty slow and I was pretty fast to make up. Marcel was our anchor and we barely won!  Nancy filmed, Nancy watched, Meredith took pictures, and the rest of us got soaked and had great fun!

<p>Inside for video games (Sega) and then Silent Football!  I was super excited to play since we didn't play at the rally.  We didn't play too long and probably that was for the best because we had new players, but afterward they were all, "I had more fun than expected!"  Awesome.

<p>Watched Trick-or-Treaters and Simpson's Halloween Specials.

<p>Wende called during the evening and I got to talk to her some!

<p>Watched X-Files (I was anti-impressed) and then Nancy and I left.  Dropped her off at her house and I went home and wrote this entry.
