<p class=date>1:55am Sunday 10 october 1999</p>

<p>Tonight Ultimate was great fun.  I played three games (lost two) and made some good catch attempts.

<p>One was a wacked out tall throw that put me near the fence and a bench (with Kristen on it) and I went sky for the disc, and had both hands on it, but they weren't together so it flipped out of my grasp.  doh!  I landed and scraped my arm on concrete (where the old benches were), but didn't stop at all.

<p>A different time I had an equally wacked out catch and I caught it, super tall in the air one hand catch!  And I even had a great throw after that!  (There exists an unverified theory that the quality of the catch times the quality of the throw is a constant.)

<p>Another time in an attempt to zip the disc down the fence to Becca, I totally threw it perfectly along the fence, but way over her head. "Wonder!  She's not the bionic woman!"

<p>Stinky sweaty came home, tons of dirt down my shower drain, wrote this entry now going to bed.

<p>Tomorrow is beach with Kristen and Farrah!

<p>Oh, I named this file ultimate_population because at one point there were 28 people on the field -- 14 against 14.  Crazy!
