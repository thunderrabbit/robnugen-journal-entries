<p class=date>4 October 1999</p>

<p>Today at work we had problems with our web server.  The CPU was being maxed out, but low disk activity, and low web data activity.  I watched as my boss did troubleshooting; I was just getting a feel for how everything goes together.  Finally he was able to track it down that a database access was taking way too long to occur.

<p>Turns out that while fetching a password for the web user, the database was being locked and just all kinds of crap.  I'm not going to explain it because I'm not impressed with how it was st up.  The problem has been temporarily fixed, and I will talk with my boss soon to see how it can be made better.

<p>But!! I had fun on my website today!  <!-- Go check out the <a href="../../index.html">front page</a>. --> I added an applet (3 times)!!  I'm not sure who wrote the applet, but I have a feeling it comes with JDK, so I don't feel bad using it.  I'm thankful for <a href="https://www.unfpa.org">unfpa</a> using it so I could swipe it from them.
