<p class=date>7 october 1999</p>

<p>Today it was decidedly cold when I woke up!  I've been sleepin' with only a sheet for the past some weeks, and my bedroom window is open so Spot can get in and out via his tree.  But this morning I woke up and brrrr!  It was like 60 degrees!  I couldn't find my comforter in my sleepy state, so I grabbed my sleeping bag and recuddled myself up for a bit.

<p>It was about 6:30 am.

<p>Oh wait.  Today I was going to do laundry.  So I got up, took a soothing hot shower and collected my ton of dirty clothes, and headed off to the laundry mat.

<p>I listened to the Ben and Sarah show on KTRU while waiting for my laundry to complete. They're fun.

<p>Finished laundry (that was quick!) and went straight to work.

<p>Here at work I've been reading about DSL and getting some good basic knowledge about how to decide what options to choose and good stuff like that.  But, I even got to show off my smart html / web brain on a question my boss had.

<p>He wanted to block all but only certain IP addresses to a set of files.  I figured out how to do it blocking a single IP address, but when it came to blocking a set of addresses, I wasn't sure how Network ID and Subnet Masking came into play.  Hmm.  So I called super smart Marcel and he was able to get me straightened out enough to get it.

<p>I got it.

<p>Good thing too because tomorrow at 8am we're going to implement the changes!

<p>I'm splitting now; will pay bills and stuff then go skating at 8pm!  See ya!
