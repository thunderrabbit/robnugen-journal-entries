<p>Yay!

<p>Today was payday at my work.  $823 for me for two weeks' work. Today I scoured the internet for a bulk email management program, but found only 2 possibilities for us.

<p>We need one that will allow us to send a unique attachment to 30000 email addresses, keep track of bounces, easily resend to a few addresses, and that's about it.

<p>I found tons and tons of software to help spammers scour the Internet for email addresses, and how to send email "without your ISP knowing you're sending bulk email!" and "free 50,000 fresh email addresses with your order!" and stuff like that. No wonder spam is so prolific!

<p>Did a little bit of javascript stuff, making some windows refresh as a different window is clicked.  I did that for Dude for some project he's doing at his work.

<p>My friend Jennie sent me a super <b>sick</b>ening photo of a crocodile with his gut cut open and... nevermind. It's gross. Don't click here<a href="http://www.artbell.com/images/amercroc.jpg">!</a>

<p>After work I filled out a form for my insurance company so they will pay for my stitches from back in JUNE! Ack.  I am anti-impressed with them.

<p>Yay!  Going to skate now!  It's 7:45pm
