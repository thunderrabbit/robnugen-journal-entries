Yesterday after doing laundry my nose got all totally stopped up and I
was blucky all day at work.  Even this morning at 4am I had like major
sinus headache and couldn't breathe so I took two pseudophedrine
hydrochloride tablets.  Oh so much better.  Today I could breath but
my headache was still there off and on throughout the day.  This
evening at 8pm I took two aspirin.  (I don't know how to spell the
chemical name.)  Oh so much better now at 9:30pm.

Today at work I essentially created a firewall for a small portion of
our website.  One set of files must only be accessed by a certain IP
address, so I told our server to only serve that portion to the
particular IP address.  My boss thought I was pretty smart.  :-)

Tomorrow I will upgrade one Windows 95 machine to Windows 98 to see if
that corrects an intermittant printing problem.  Hopefull that will
fix it and I can look even smarter.

Kristen and I are going to watch a movie or something at her parents,
either Pulp Fiction or something else they might possibly maybe have
that I'd prefer to watch.

OH!!! I found on the internet the complete text to Hitchhiker's Guide
To The Galaxy trilogy!  I have the URL bookmarked at work..  hang on..

I can't find it now.  I found one that included Book I, but not all 5
books in the trilogy.

Okay, now we're going to watch a movie.
