Wende and I watched <em>Blast From The Past</em> last night.  It was great!

I was actually pretty surprised at how well I liked it.  I thought it
would just be a cheesy romance thing, but I was laughing at the
situations and all the wacky funny stuff!

Given the plot, the resulting situations were believable (assuming
they could in fact survive 35 years in a large hole) and quite
entertaining.  Good ending and all that.

The funniest scene to me: he was outside skating, and some beautiful
women skated by and smiled hugely at him.  His eyes kinda went gaga,
but it turns out, not at the skaters!

Go check it out!
