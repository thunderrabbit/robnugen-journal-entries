<p>nice.  My Card A balance is 0 dollars.  Soon as I finish this entry, I'll have them pay Card D (or was it C?)

<p>Until yesterday I have had just one computer (PII 350Mhz) running with 2 hard disks in it - a 1 gig and 8 gig, with 300 megs given to Windows 95 and the rest to linux.  I've been using linux to access the internet and everything.

<p>I had 2 disks sitting on my desk and a shell of my old linux machine (PII 233Mhz) with no hard disks in it.  I began the process of installing those disks in the machine.  One of the disks was reporting bad media or faulty track 0, and could not be used.  Doh!  That was a 2.5 gig.  The other (1 gig) formatted okay, and I got Win 95 installed on it, but it seems to have some surface errors that I'm having scandisk fix now.  It's taken all night because it keeps restarting (even though I'm running in safe mode with no other drivers up; MS is such crap).

<p>Yesterday at KTRU, I was thrilled to see 2 or 3 more of the CDs I reviewed recently are in playlist!  Yay!  Mostly thrilled to see Momus <em>Stars Forever</em>; I really enjoyed that one.  I waited until I got some callers (so I knew people were listening. (I had announced as soon as I got on the air, "if you're listening, call me and I'll give you free bumper stickers!" and no one called.  (Maybe free bumper stickers are not enough to get a call.))) and then played one of my favorite tracks.  I don't remember the name of it, but it's a hard rap in first person about how shy the rapper is.  Very funny.

<p>Also at KTRU, I got to give away passes to <a href="https://www.theminusman.com">The Minus Man</a>.  I had helped myself to a pass (we had a stack; I assume it was okay.) and Kristen and I went last night.  The movie was Okay, but not thrilling or even quite captivating, but more odd. It was basically about some guy who was a bit mentally unstable and seemed very nice, but gently killed people.  At least Janeane Garafulo (sp) was cute.

<p>Right now I'm going to update my credit card stuff on my front page and go to work.  See ya!
