<p>I came in to work today for the speedy internet connection, and so I could review CDs while I'm online.  At home, I use linux to be online, but I haven't set it up to be able to listen to CDs.

<p>Today I reviewed <i>pro audio</i> by neil landstrumm, and <i>a ma zone</i> by zap mama.

<p>Neil CD was techno-esque with mostly two step (boom tik boom tik boom tik sound) and lots of layers of electronics on that.

<p>Zap Mama features beautiful melodious female vocals with a grand variety of instruments backing them up.  The sounds ranged from jazz, to hip hop, to tribal, to funk, to reggae.  Lots of great stuff.

<p>Last night I went to a party with a friend of mine (I'm going to keep this entirely anonymous).  A friend of my friend called the party, with an odd question/concern: had his fiance' and a mutual friend showed up at the party?

<p>He was at a payphone, slightly intoxicated (he had mostly sobered up after being on the phone with our party for an hour), and had been left there essentially, by his fiance' and a friend of his and another friend, because he didn't want to go with them, but wanted to stay home and study.  They refused to take him home, his fiance' refused to give him even his house keys... I don't know the whole story, but he was worried/angry about them, they were no where to be found, and it was just so melodramatic!

<p>I don't even really have a point, but it just seemed so odd to me that people would act like that.

<p>I called Card A today and I have a balance of $5603.22 on it!  Yay!  This is good because it means the balance is being carried at 4.9%, instead of 18 or 13 percent on the other cards.  The 4.9% interest rate is good for 6 months from now, so I will have to move it again in April.
