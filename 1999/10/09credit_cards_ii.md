<p>Hmmm.

<p>Card A said it might take 2 weeks to make the balance transfers, but I called them tonight anyway to see what was up.  Turns out that neither one was processed; it would have put me over my credit limit.  Doh.  I think a finance charge was applied to Card A and the balance transfers would have therefore put me over my limit.  They were carefully measured to put me right exactly at my limit.  

<p>So I asked the guy if I could make a balance transfer.  He reminded me that the current balance that I carry would stay at the higher interest rate of 13.15% until I pay off the balance transfer.

<p>Fair enough.  So I believe I will transfer Card A balance to Card C and then back to Card A.  He said that would be no problem.

<p>Called Card C and they said they didn't do balance transfers.  Hmf.   So I'm going to now call Card D.

<p>Called Card D and the woman said no problem and they will pay $640.09 to Card A within 3 to 5 days.  "To be safe," she said, "we have to say that. It will probably be more like 1 or 2 days."

<p>So as soon as that goes through, I'll have Card A pay Card D for the entire Card D balance, effectively moving the balance from 12.99% to 4.9% interest. 

<p>Nice!

<p>In other news, I'm going to play Ultimate tonight and Kristen is coming to watch.  

<p>Then tomorrow Kristen, Farrah and I are going to Galveston.  Yay!
