<p>It's 11:15; I'm going and I'll let you know what happens!

<p>I sat in the glorious weather reading my KTRU DJ manual, taking the KTRU DJ Aptitude Test (KDAT) when Dude walked up.

<p>"Did I tell you that I have no idea what she looks like?" he asked.

<p>"Nope.  Do you know her name?"

<p>"Umm..  Dawn."

<p>I wrote "DAWN" bigly on a napkin and Dude went to get a burrito. He came back a few minutes later with Dawn.

<p>Dawn is cool. She has an awesome travel job, driving to a remote location and testing pipelines for corrosion by hiking along the line. (That's my short version of what she does.)  Dude was like, "whoah! you get paid to hike?"  

<p>We talked job stuff a lot and then Dude had to leave and Dawn and I talked coaster stuff. My sense is that she loves coasters like I did last year.. loves them, but hasn't been to a lot of parks. I described some of my adventures during the summer armed with Six Flags Season Pass.

<p>I had to return to work, so here I am.
