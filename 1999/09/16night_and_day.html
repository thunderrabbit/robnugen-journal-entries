<p>Last night after work I drove to KTRU to drop off a CD I had reviewed.  It's a good CD; got a good review. I had one problem, though; I left the CD at home and had just brought the case.  Doh!

<p>After that I cruised to Mad Potter to paint my plate and Jennifer was there, "hey let's go for a walk."  We walked and she expressed a large amount of confusion and general unhappiness about some people in her life.  I listened and (hopefully) helped her make some decisions about how to handle the various situations.

<p>Then went over to Kristen's to watch a movie. We talked and stuff and when her brother Matt got home, he was all, "where's the dogs?"

<p>"What?"

<p>Apparently they had gotten out of the outside gate when Kristen let them outside.  We hung out outside in the street for a bit while Matt drove around the neighborhood looking for them. Two relatively big german shepherds. Found them and turns out one had hurt her foot; couldn't walk. We determined it was just a surface wound and not a broken bone or anything. That's good, but still bad in a way.

<p>Then we started the movie and it <em>*SUCKED*!!</em>

<p>I encourage everyone to not see <em>Another Day in Paradise</em>.

<p>We didn't finish the movie.

<p>I left late, went to Wende's to help her eat the ice cream that was slowly melting in her freezer that's not working very well.  Then it was even later, so I spent the night at Wende's house and had good breakfast and ice cream in the morning before work.

<p>Today at work I've been mostly spending the whole morning messing with a UPS (not United Parcel Service, but Uninterruptable Power Supply) that doesn't seem to work correctly no matter what combination of com ports, cables, or software versions I've tried.

<p>At one point, a peer of mine was talking to the rep at the UPS place and they were both frustrated and almost got grouchy at one another. Fortunately my peer got a phone call and had to leave the room.

<p>Still no success on the UPS. So now I'm going through the process of renewing our digital ID key thing with VeriSign, so we can have a secure web server.  So much stuff to learn!
