<p class=date>27 September 1999</p>

Today I had a great day at work.

This was the first day I worked on one project pretty much all day.
The goal was to get our NT workstations to act as secure web servers.
We already have Personal Web Server installed on them, but they had no
option to be secure servers.

The call to Microsoft helped fix that.  It took a couple of phone
calls, and actually Kristian called me back (I misspelled his name
previously) at one point and helped me get all set up.

So my PC is able to be used as a secure server for testing purposes.
Great!

I also had fun chatting with Zara and kT over ICQ.  Zara is in San
Antonio, kT here in H-town.  We just talked random silly stuff, a lot
while I was on hold.  I'm now zipping off to I-group.  Have a great
day!
