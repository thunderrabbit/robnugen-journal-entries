<p class=date>7 September 1999</p>

<p>Today started a new semester at KTRU.  My new shift is now Tuesdays from 9am to 11am. 

<p>This is my first semester with only a 2 hour shift!  Holy cow it went by so quickly today!

<p>The coolest thing is that at 9am, no one is on before me, so I get to turn on the station in the morning.  So check it out each Tuesday at 9am CST (<a href="http://www.ktru.org/ktru.html">www.ktru.org</a>) and you can hear me make the official Sign On Announcement about the station and 50,000 watts and all that.

<p>No one called me today at the station, well except for one person, but she was trying to reach someone else.  Oh well.

<p>Maybe I'll have a contest this next Tuesday for free bumper stickers!!

<p>Oh!!! And the funniest thing!  I gave the opening announcement and then was all, if you have any requests, call 713-___  and I gave <em>my</em> phone number!  No one called; apparently no one was listening.  Good thing because I said, "holy shit that's my number!  Ooops I'll just stop talking now and play a song."

<p>That (saying "shit") was my first FCC violation and I could be fined up to $10,000 dollars and be imprisoned for up to 2 years.  Doh!!
