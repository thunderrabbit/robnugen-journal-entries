<p class=date>27 September 1999</p>

I'm currently on hold with Microsoft support.  Christian is helping me 
figure out how to get MS Personal Web Server to support SSL encryption. 

Relatively speaking, the support has been good though Christian is the 
third person I've spoken with (let me transfer you to the correct 
department)

But that's not why I'm writing.

I got my linux box back up!!

The saga is long and arduous - here is a short version:

Problem:  I ran out of disk space on my 1 gig linux disk
Resources:  I have an 8 gig disk with windows on it
Goal: put windows on 1 gig disk, and linux on 8 gig disk
Saga:
* I archived windows stuff
* Installed linux 5.0 on 8 gig disk, but it wouldn't boot
* Tried Boot Magic; tried Partition Magic
  this required reinstalling windows because BM and PM won't install
  on linux
* Tried linux 6.0
** got linux 6.0 installed but it wouldn't boot
* Tried Boot Magic; tried Partition Magic
  this required reinstalling windows because BM and PM won't install
  on linux
* Reached a point where I had windows on a small partition and linux
  6.0 across the other partitions
* Was able to boot linux 6.0 with a floppy
* Could not get linux 6.0 to connect to internet (PPP)
* Said forget 6.0
* Reinstalled linux 5.0 and magically, it is able to boot.

The ** above indicates a error on my part: I installed linux 6.0 on my
linux 5.0 drive and wiped out all my old linux info, unfortunately
including all old email messages and the current in-progress Feel Good
Net issue.

The good thing is that I now have grand incentive to find a driver for
linux to use my ZIP drive.  Also, I learned several cool things about
linux, making me even happier with my choice to use it.

Over the four or five days my computer was down, I received 81 email
messages. Many of them, yes are from email lists: youth related and
Flashnet related. But most of them by far are people sending me crap,
with a few good messages mixed in. I have added filters to my inbox to
help with the load.

So tonight I'll be working more on my computer (after my I-group
meeting); maybe I'll figure out how to get java to work so I can have
ICQ at AIM at my house again!

Oh, the other cool thing is that because both disks are on the same
machine, (I have an extra computer with no drives, and) linux is able
to write directly to the windows directory, making it TONS easier for
me to transfer between the systems on the rare occasions that I need
to. Nice.

Maybe I'll trade my other PC for a laptop.  It's a PII 233mhz with a
KILLER video card.  Hmmmm.
