<p class=date>11 September 1999</p>

<p>On Friday night around 9pm, my brother Fred left Slidell, Louisiana for Houston to say HI to family and friends before going to Stanford for school.  He drove for a few hours, slept 5 hours, got to my apartment at 8am Saturday.

<p>A few hours later, we were at Astroworld.  I'll omit the detail about crappy traffic due to some sporting event at the Astrodome.

<p>We both have Six Flags season passes, and we've both attended several different parks this season.  He's attended more than I, but I did see Six Flags Great America in Chicago while he did not.

<p>I had great fun bantering with him in line, talking about coasters and similarities, cool variations, the best, oldest, fastest, newest, most inversions...  We cracked each other up with old and new jokes and fairly entertained or maybe annoyed the people around us.  

<p>Started at Serial Thriller, which I've ridden about 6 times, but he had not yet. I put him in a right hand seat (we didn't wait for front seat) so he could experience the thrill of thinking his leg might get wacked at a particularly close-looking encounter with another part of the track.

<p>It was cool, but the line too long for us to wanna ride it again, so we headed to Viper.  Rode Viper about 5 times in a row, usually without waiting for a train, just off then run around and back on same train, or not even have to leave the station and just change seats.

<p>Viper begins its descent through a tunnel, and Fred noticed that just outside the tunnel, there is a track that is <em>really</em> close and maybe he could hit it on the way down!

<p>He asked one of the ride ops if he could do it (not asking for permission, but if someone could possibly reach the other track).  The ride op didn't know but said, "try it!"

<p>Around that moment, I got a call on my cell phone.  It was Kristen.  I was all practically yelling, "yeah we're at Astroworld and Fred is about to try something cool on Viper!"

<p>While still talking to Kristen, the ride started and I narrated while we rode and described Fred's endeavors.  Down through the tunnel zoom <em>whap!</em> he got it!  "Whoo hoo!!" we shouted with glee through most of the rest of the ride.  He showed me his hand all greasy smeared and a bit red. We hopped triumphantly off the ride and Fred showed off the grease.  "Don't try it; it hurts a lot."

<p>As we walked to the next ride, I explained to Kristen everything that had happened, then hung up with her as we skipped Texas Tornado which was out of service probably until Fright Fest in October.  Doh.

<p>Then we also skipped XLR8, which was the first suspended ride of its kind when built, but now it's so outdated that I've heard this is its last season.  I'm greatly looking forward to some HUGE and INCREDIBLE coaster in 2000!!!

<p>To Greezed Lightnin' where we rode it about 8 times in a row, in various seats, in various apparent moods:  "Poker Face!" and we would sit upright and blank stare straight ahead the entire ride.  "Sleep!" and we would feign sleep the entire ride.  It's a shuttle loop coaster; the entire ride is only like 35 seconds.

<p>While on that ride, we met some woman and her kid, for both of whom this was their first time to ride.  We were all, "you gotta put up your hands!!!" and we demonstrated for them, waving to the  small crowd that often gathers below the loop. They (new riders) were fun.

<p>Then to Batman the Escape, where the line was pretty darn short, but Fred wasn't super impressed with the ride so we only did it once.  Funny thing was Marcel called me and I almost got to talk to him while on the ride but the ride ops wouldn't let me.  Oh well.  One coaster-phone-call is good for a day.

<p>Then Ultra Twister, which was ho hum; I'm still kinda upset they wasted such an amazing design potential on an essentially 2D track. Fred tried to be all, "well it's the first of its kind blah blah blah" but I'm not really buying it.

<p>Then to Texas Cyclone, which we rode once in the front seat of the back car and once in the front seat of the front car.

<p>Coolest thing about that is when we got off, they have pictures available that were taken while we were on the ride.  Some kid in the very back seat spray-spat some kind of water just at that moment; it was a very cool effect to see captured on film.  Good timing, man!

<p>Then we were pretty much hot and bored, so we left.

<p>This time the traffic was even <em>worse</em>, as the same sporting event was now finished and flooded the streets with cars again!  Augh!!

<p>We made it out though, and joined Wende for lunch at Taco Bell. Yay!
