<p class=date>7 September 1999</p>

<p>Yesterday we went to Waterworld, the wet and wild theme park next to Six Flags Astroworld.  (We in the above sentence = me, Jennifer, Charyl, Mark, Lynn, and Kyle.  Charyl organized the trip; she had some extra free tickets from something else.  I have my season pass, so I invited Jennifer.  Anyway, we all went.)

<p>There's a pretty cool slide there - 90 feet tall and nearly straight down at first, with a smooth transition to flat at the bottom.  I and the three girls went down that, but Mark and Kyle politely declined.  Kyle openly expressed his fear.

<p>Some of the park employees went down the slide, and I was super envious that they got to go down head first.  I begged the various life guards during the day to let me go down head first, but none let me.  It wasn't worth getting kicked out of the park to do it, so I didn't.

<p>I did, however, tread water for 15 minutes (in two intervals), including 10 minutes while the big waves were pouring from the back of the wave pool.  How do they make those waves?  Big giant paddles behind the wall?  Very interesting to me, that.

<p>As a group we went to The Big Red Slide, which turned out to be <em>fabulous</em> fun.  All six of us could ride at once down in these big innertube things, and the walls were all curvy and we would whooosh!!  way up on the side and the person at the top of the turn would almost fall onto those at the bottom.  We yelled and had a great time twice down this ride.

<p>We also spent a significant amount of time climbing all over a giant climby splashy maze of netting and tubes and tunnels and water hoses and buckets and squirt guns and had a crazy fun time.  Every couple of minutes, a giant bucket at the very top would be tipped over and a huge torrent of water would flood the entire thing, much to the excitement of everyone climbing all over.

<p>Unfortunately, one of my favorite water slide things was "broken," according to a life guard.  It was a lazy stream of slides and pools where people in innertubes like blood cells would float toward the bottom.  From the Big Red Slide steps, I could see portions of the broken slide filled with pine needles instead of water.

<p>Fun was had by all for several hours.  We pretty much got tired and changed and headed back to our cars just in time before a tremendous deluge of rain covered the whole city for a few minutes.  Yay us!
