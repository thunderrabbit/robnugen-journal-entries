<p class=date>17 September 1999</p>

<p>Friday night is <a href="http://mkultra.txraves.org">MK Ultra</a> night at KTRU, so I cruised out there to say HI to Tejus and Eric, who was spinning ambient techno on the air!  Eric is great fun (same Eric who I DJed with about a month ago 1-4am) and I feel a certain comradery with him, since he's just getting started a spinning and mixing vinyl. It was great to watch and talk and see him get better.  He had great segues in his hour set except for one killer that elicited an agonizing groan from him as my ears went, "ouch!"

<p>When he was finished, Eric went home and Dustin came in to mix.  He scratched some records, including some old classical albums that are free for the taking at the station and Tejus and I were so impressed!

<p>At 1am when the next DJs came in for their general shift, the input level for the mixing turntables is supposed to be turned off. (The DJs mix in a room different from the control room.) Tejus went in to get some lessons from Dustin on scratching and I noticed it was being broadcast over the music that was supposed to be playing! A caller called and asked for Tejus and I was all, "um, he's busy being broadcast but he doesn't know it; are you listening now?"  The caller was, and we all had a good laugh. Even Tejus when he found out about it.
