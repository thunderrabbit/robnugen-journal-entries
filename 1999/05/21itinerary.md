##21 May 1999

<p>Here is our itinerary as faxed from my travel agent. It may change, but probably will not.

<p>Quote: Qantas Vacations

<ul>
<li>Nov 5 - Depart Houston to Sydney
<li>Nov 6 - Arrive Sydney 1 night hotel reserved
<li>.
<li>Nov 10 - Depart Sydney to Ayers Rock (Qantas)
<br>3 nights at Emu Walk Apartments [eating grubs with aborigines]
<li>.
<li>Nov 13 - Depart Ayers Rock to Sydney (Qantas) 1 night hotel reserved
<li>. [ go to Gladstone (Great Barrier Reef area) ]
<li>Nov 17 - Helicopter from Gladstone to Heron Island
<li>5 nights at Heron Island Resort [lots of scuba diving]
<li>Nov 22 - Catamaran from Heron Island to Gladstone
<li>.
<li>Dec 11 - Depart Cairns to Houston
</ul>

<p>Price per person is $3500, unless we share a bathroom with someone at Heron Island, it's $3280.

<p>Notice the big chunks of time indicated by gaps on the list.  I'm thinking I'll request that the [ go to Gladstone ] gap be enlarged and shrink the Nov 22 to Dec 11 gap some, unless Gladstone is a long ass way to Cairns.  Maybe we'll hop over to New Zealand during that time.
