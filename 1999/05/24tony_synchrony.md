##11am Sunday 24 May 1999

<p>Crazy!

<p>I just finished doing laundry and thought, "I'm hungry."  My inner voice pointed toward Kroger.  "Go eat."

<p>So I'm sittin' in Kroger, eating eggs and biscuits and contemplating life.

<p>Suddenly I see Tony, one of my warrior brothers.  Recognition smiles across our faces.  "Hey!"

<p>He's all, "what are you up to?"

<p>"I'm just sittin' in Kroger, eating eggs and biscuits and contemplating life.   In general I'm working saving money to go to Australia in November."

<p>"You're kidding."

<p>"No; I'm very excited about it!"

<p>Turns out Tony lived in Australia for 5 years, and still has contacts there who he said would be happy to give Jason and I a place to stay!!  WOW!!

<p>Great stories he told of racing yachts and of Sydney and beaches and the whole fun lifestyle the Aussies live.  We only talked for like 10 minutes, but I gave him my card and he'll get me in touch with his homies.  So awesome.

<p>Thank you Angels.
