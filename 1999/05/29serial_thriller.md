<p>Wende and I went to Astroworld today to ride Serial Thriller. We spent the night at her house (since it's closer to the park) and got up, bought bagels at Einstein's and got to the Astroworld parking lot gate at 8:30 as it opened.  They still had a secondary gate locked so we waited.  We were the second car to arrive, but there were two lanes so we were beside them at least.

<p>More cars crowded behind us; some saw that the gates were locked and they left.  A dad and two kids were dropped off at the gate; we offered them a ride across the parking lot once the gates opened.  They thankfully accepted the offer so they and I all piled into the back of Wende's truck as we waited and chatted with them until 9am when the parking lot gates were opened.

<p>The race was on.  Across the parking lot people drove; to the front gates of Astroworld people ran.  Wende and I ended up second in line in one of 6 or so lines.  At 9:35 we were let into the park, but again had to wait behind a security-guarded rope.

<p>"Jennifer" was written on the security guard's nametag, and she boosted the energy by having us cheer and all kinds of wacky stuff.  I was totally into it; we were about to ride Serial Thriller.  She asked trivia questions about the park and let people go "first" if they knew the answers!!!  I knew lots of answers and even stumped her with a few, but for some reason I never got called forward.  I must say it was pretty frustrating; I had to take a zen-like approach and believe everything will happen as it should.  Apparently I was not to be called forward.

<p>When it was time to let us in, a small miscommunication between the security guards (Dwayne said "don't go yet;"  Jennifer waved for the group to go) and the crowd split for an instant then flooded toward the ride.  Another thing that was wack: there are train tracks for the Astroworld train just in front of the entrance.  Just as we approached, I joked, "watch the crossing guards go down"  and they did!!  With the train approaching, I was all, "come on!" and grabbed Wende's hand as we ducked under the arms with a few other peeps.  Wende and I ended up in line about 200 people back.

<p>It was all good; we played Egyptian Rat Screw while waiting.  I got some cool closer-up shots of the ride as park security got to ride, park employees got to ride, then Jennifer's group got to ride.  The crowd cheered as we were allowed to move forward.

<p>The line woulda taken only like 30 minutes, but we waited for the coveted front seats, so it took an extra 15 or so.  One thing that was cool for one girl:  she mosied (past tense of mosey) into the line for the third seat on the train.  She was riding alone, as was the guy in the front seat.  She got to join him in the front, while Wende and I still had like 14 people in front of us in line.  Amazing good timing for that girl.  (I hope she enjoyed the front)

<p>Finally it was time.  I sat on the right hand side; I saw one point of the circuit where the right hand side flew higher and asked Wende for that side.  

<p>We left the station, up up up up up up up up up up up up up down down down (as the back of the train was still going up) then WHOOOOOSH!!!  I was singing and expressing joyful noises unto the coaster, mostly aware of everything the ride had to offer as I had studied each move it made while I was in line.  I had my hands up and my legs up like flying and having a great time until near the end, "YAAAA!!  HOLY SHmoley my leg!!!"  

<p>Nothing happened to my leg, but adrenaline surged through my system!  That was so close!!

<p><blockquote>On Serial Thriller, the train is suspended below the track, allowing riders' legs to dangle and swing freely about.  At one point, the tracks are essentially "back to back."  The train passes just under this point, makes a short 270 degree turn (plus a half twist) and crosses just <em>above</em> the same point.  To make this all possible, the half twist flips the train upside down at the last possible second in the world.  Never before has a half twist procrastenated so carelessly.</blockquote>

<p>Sheer thrilldom that my leg was still there and <em>WOW</em> that seemed so close!!!  Gotta ride it again.  Gotta get some pics!!  I waited for the next train and got a picture of that point.  I don't think the picture quite captured the essence of the thrill, but we'll see.

<p>Back in line; this time we didn't play Egyptian Rat Screw, but met some high school youth from Corpus Christi.  We talked coasters and stuff during the 53 minutes in line.  This time we rode in the very back seat.  I sat on the right hand side again, but this time I took pictures.

<p>Up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up WHOOOOSH!!!!!!  and I took a pic.  Shot after shot; I tried to keep the camera steady (the ride is super smooth for a coaster, but it's like trying to write neatly while in a car.  It may feel smooth, but the writing looks like crap.)  Picture picture picture.  In 45 seconds of ride, I took 11 pictures.  I even got a shot of the leg remover.

<p>The ride over, I squiggled to get my camera hidden back in my pocket.  I did an okay job of it, and used my shirt to cover the rest.

<p>Rode again.  (This time the line was a bit shorter)  Talked to some different people in line.  They had just moved to Houston from California, near Great America (not Great America in Chicago) where they have awesome coasters as well.  Anyway talk talk talk and the line was like 45 minutes and we rode about 4 seats from the back.

<p>Wende rode on the right and I was back to singing and waving and stuff.  I even rode barefoot for the occasion.  Wende didn't get freaked at the leg thing, but I told her to ride in the front seat and see how she feels about it.

<p>Tons of fun.

<p>Wende had to pee, so we didn't get back in line.  The weather said "fine" and a big storm blew in and they quit running the ride about 10 trains after we got off.

<p>We ate a chili cheese dog as crowds walked past us out of the park.  (I got a cheesy picture of Wende with chili and cheese on her face after I unhelpfully helped her have a bite.)  We soakingly rode Warp 2000, but it was pretty cold rain and not quite as enjoyable as other Astroworld rain experiences I've had when I was in high school.  Warm deep puddles of water through which we could splash and slide and play.  Not today, so we went home.

<p>Back toward the truck we walked barefootedly.  I put on my shoes and surfed down a grassy hill.  Fun fun fun.  I'll get the pictures developed soon.
