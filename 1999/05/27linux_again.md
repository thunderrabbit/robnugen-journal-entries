<p class=date>Thursday 27 May 1999</p>

<p>Back some months (year?) ago, I worked on installing Linux and Windows on one machine.  I had big problems at first with Windows trying to be the main boot manager, but finally was able to get it to all work in relative harmony.  When I installed Windows 98 on the same machine, intending for it to replace only the Windows 95 partition, tragedy struck, I lost Linux accessibility altogether, and Win98 was unstable like anything, so I started from scratch again.

<p>Since then I have purchased a new machine (that I'm using now) and for some reason though I have 128 megs of RAM, Netscape is complaining about out-of-memory when I pull up more than like 3 netscape windows.  It didn't previously have a problem with this; I don't know what is the problem.  (If you know please email me at <a href="mailto:rob-nugen@flash.net">rob-nugen@flash.net</a> (take out the spam reducing hyphen))

<p>So I've got two machines (actually 3 counting my cute 486/33 DOS based machine with some cool old files) and I intend to put linux on the other and use it for web browsing type stuff.  We'll see how it all goes.

<p>I went to Astroworld yesterday and Serial Thriller was running, but not open to the public.  The ride has some great inversions, including 1/2 a loop, a full corkscrew, then the other 1/2 of the loop.  Other maneuvers were there, but I couldn't really see them because of trees.

<p>It opens on Saturday to the public.  I will be there.

<p>I rode all the cool coasters at least twice (Texas Tornado I rode 6 times) to get them out of my system for a bit.  Saturday total focus will be Serial Thriller.

<p>Today I'll be at KTRU from 1-4 covering for Robert, and then I'll learn how to broadcast the Rice baseball game so I can make 35 bucks doing that in an afternoon.
