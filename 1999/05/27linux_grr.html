<p>The machine I wanted to convert to linux, apparently, for no apparent reason, has broken.

<p>It was so cute - Win 95 with almost no drivers, almost nothing on the disk..  I copied to floppies a couple of files that I wanted to keep, and I was ready to install linux.  

<p>Taking an inventory of the machine, I booted it a couple times to see what chipset was on the video card.  It didn't say how much memory was on the card, so I powered down and removed the card.  I couldn't really tell, so I put the card back in.

<p>Turned it on and got angry BEEEEEPs back.  No signal to the monitor.  What???  All I did was remove and replace the video card.

<p>I've tried another video card and it did not work.  I have no idea what I may have done.  Sigh.  It was a PII 233.  Do I need a new motherboard?  New CPU?  What could I have done?
