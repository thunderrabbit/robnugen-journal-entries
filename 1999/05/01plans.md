<p class="note">(14 Feb 2015, as I process old entries, I see this file didn't have a date, so I estimated)</p>

## May 1999 (estimated)

<p>Jason called me and we began discussing plans.  He's been before, and wants to re-experience Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef, but this time scuba certified.

<p>I've been before and want to re-experience Katoomba Falls, but this time when their roller coaster is open (Australian summer).

<p>So we created the following plan:

<table border="1">
<caption><b>Things to do before we go</b></caption>
<tr><td><b>Item</b></td><td><b>Complete</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>determine dates</td><td>5 November 1999 - 11 December 1999</td></tr>
<tr><td>Scuba Certification</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>Australian visas</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>get tickets</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>get a laptop</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>collect snail addresses of people in US to write</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>cable</td><td>I don't know what this is or why it's on my list.</td></tr>

<tr><td> </td><td> </td></tr>
</table>

<p><table border="1">
<caption><b>Things to do while there</b></caption>
<tr><td><b>Item</b></td><td><b>Complete</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>purchase an overhead spinner instrument thing like on Crocodile Dundee</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>ride <em>Orphan Rocker</em> at Katoomba Falls</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>scuba at Heron Island</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>bungee jump off something cool</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>see Ayers Rock</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td> </td><td> </td></tr>
</table>
