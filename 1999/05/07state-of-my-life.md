<p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>

<p><ol>

<p><li>Jason Fricke called me back on the morning of the Friday that Wende and I went to Six Flags over Texas.  The short version is that he invited me to Australia with him for four months.  Four months!!!???  Nope nope nope couldn't do it, and turned him down altogether, but I thought about it and decided I could go for one month.  So the plan is for Jason and I to go to Australia(!!!) from 5 November to like 11 December 1999. More <a href="australia/index.html">here</a>.</li>

<p><li>I found a super cool applet composer by <a href="http://www.opencube.com">www.opencube.com</a> and I made a cool applet with it, but turns out that not all of them are free.  I'll have to pay $189 to get this applet on my site.</li>

<p><li>I lost my camera.  I had it after Six Flags over Texas, but not at Astroworld when we went last weekend.  Pooh.  I'm taking Wende's tomorrow.</li>

<p><li>Tomorrow (actually today in 6 hours) I'm going to fly to Chicago to attend Six Flags Great America!!!!!!!!  My friend Carina will pick me up from the airport and I'll crash at her crib and we'll check out the park Saturday and maybe Sunday.</li>

<p><li>Today I had fun at KTRU.  I played both sides of a 12 inch vinyl called something like "Alice in Wonderland" by Magilla Gorilla.  Cute and funny.  Also funny was when Side One ended, I played DJ Silver "Don't Panic" and told listeners "don't panic; I'm turning the record over."  No one panicked.  No one even called during my shift.  'Cept for Wende, but that doesn't count.</li>

<p><li>I just started my <a href="australia/index.html">Australia</a> pages. Now it's 2:40am.  I have to pack and leave my house in less than 4 hours.</li>
