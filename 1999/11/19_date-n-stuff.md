ERRRGG!!

I wrote a beatiful description of what index.pl is designed to do.  Absolutely beautiful. 
The beauty is that it actually correctly described what it did and it was easily read and
made sense, and it was all perfectly justified.  Same number of characters per line......

And I can't find it!

Okay, so yes, 11-19-99 was yesterday, the last odd day for a long time.  I may write more
on that.  Um, o I'm off to a meeting now for planning the big <a href="http://www.heartstormproductions.com">event</a>
and then to a lock-in overnight with my youth.  Planning for big rally in January.  Yay!!

Gotta shower and get ready for overnight in 12 minutes!
