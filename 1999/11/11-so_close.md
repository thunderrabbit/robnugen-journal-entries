<h1>So close!</h1>

<p class=date_>20:41 Thursday 11 November 1999</p>

<p>This part of robnugen.com is so close to being ready.  I think there's just two more things I want to add:  One is to have index.pl send me email if it has an error.  Two is to get the CSS nice, but that's not critical.   I can hopefully get the email part figured out tonight, and Dude can help me with the CSS over the weekend!  (He's got a cool little book on it)

<p>Today I added logic to index.pl:  If no file was chosen on the URL, look for a file with 'description' in its name.  If it exists, display it!  If such doesn't exist, display the last file (alphabetical order) that exists in the directory.   My goal was to allow descriptions in the "root" directories of years or the whole folder, and when in a folder full of files, make the default file be the most recent.  (Assumes I prefix all file names with 2 digit date of month.)

<p>It works, and I love it!

<p>Today I had a most cool day at work.  I am 1 itty bitty bit away from being done with my SAS / JavaScript / HTML project!!  Did I describe it already?  I think I did.  The last little bit that I need to add will check for missing data and prompt the user to add it.  I thought I could get it done tonight, but the SAS syntax was messing me up.  I needed to simply concatenate a string  (string = string + '}') but I couldn't figure it out.

Okay, now I'm going to work on the email part of this.
