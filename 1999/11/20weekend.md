Over the weekend Wende and I spent a lot of time together.  It's
certainly nice to have her home!  We have not jumped right back into a
sexual relationship; she has asked that we start over 'new' and that
has certainly been a challenge for me.  I can see the value in it.

On Saturday she joined me at the Altar Allstars meeting (we who are
creating the Altars for the <a href="https://www.heartstormproductions.com">Techno Cosmic Mass</a>
called ourselves Altar Allstars) where we hashed out a general framework
that each altar will use, and brainstormed some on the specifics for
each one.  We also created deadlines for plans to be turned in.  We need
to hurry!!

I enjoyed getting to say HI to and sit beside Madeline.  I'm glad she
and Wende have finally met; I think there is no jealousy or weirdness.

Saturday afternoon and overnight Wende and I were at the Houston Rally
Planning Lock-in.  The Houston Rally will happen in January 2000
(assuming the planet doesn't explode) and this overnight event was
just to plan the Jan 2000 weekend event.

I have been the "adult in charge" of the Houston Rally for the past 3
years.  This year I am not.  I stayed mostly out of the meetings,
listening while lying down on the edge of the circle, or while playing
Go with Martha (I stomped her) then with Ralph (he stomped me).

I slept from 11pm to 6am or so.  Nice.

I have mixed feelings about not being in the thicket of rally
planning.  Good feelings of relief mostly. I basked in great memories
of Jason and I pulling of huge awesome Saturday Night Events.  Jason
has graduated and wasn't even at the meeting this weekend; I am ready
to allow someone else be in charge.

Afternoon on Sunday Wende and I helped Christine and her friends paint
her house.  Actually Christine was feeling pretty sick (stress,
allergy type stuff) and we painted for her as she talked as chattily
as she could with sore throat.  Watching that dynamic really got me
thinkin'....  how has Christine created friendship bonds that will
bring peeps over to her house to paint while she's sick?  Would my
friends do that?  (yes actually) Would I be able to ask them for the
help?  (That's the bigger question) I felt envious in a way; inspired
in another.  Not sure where to go now as I write this.

In the evening, Wende and I went to movies with Maggie, John, Molly,
Will, Meredith, Eric.  We saw The Messenger and I loved it.  I was
overwhelmed with love for Joan played by Milla Jovovich (so much so
that I memorized how to spell her name).. just the <em>passion</em>
she embodied. incredible.  Something gentle inside me said "you can do
that too" (where "that" means 'inspire others so greatly' and not
'lead a huge army into war')..  So huge.  wow.  Go see it, but know
there is lots of blood.

Then home to our separate apartments and to bed.

This morning I recognized suddenly that I haven't meditatively written
a "things to do" list in quite a while.  I did so this morning and I
think today (and this week) will be a happily productive week!
