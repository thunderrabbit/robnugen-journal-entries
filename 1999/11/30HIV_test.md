<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

Wende and I are at Family Planning Center for HIV tests.  Went to
Container Store and got shelf stuff for my new shelves!!!  So very
exciting!  Signed up for webquarry.com to host robnugen.com and will
hopefully leave it here for a long time.  Should be able to have cool
perl scripts and have access to my perl error logs!  I haven't written
any journal entries for a while - not since 24 Nov 1999.

I'm pretty caught up in here and I can just transcribe them but I have a
concern about writing all kinds of sex stuff on my site.  I asked for
Wende's opinion and she was all, "isscool with me; just don't describe
anything explicitly."   That makes sense.

There are more considerations, of course - mainly who will read them. 
In some parts of our lives we are role models to youth, and I know some
of them read my site.  This is the real me, guys.  Advisors are people
too.
