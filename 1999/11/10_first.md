<h1>Just to see</h1>

<p>Today I had a most awesome day at work.  I greeted everyone with my FSD Data Services plate (I painted our logo on a plate at Mad Potter) and everyone oohed and ahhed in a most pleasing way.  I ate 3 sandwiches from it today!

<p>In addition to eating sandwiches, I faxed in our request for DSL to Savvis Communications!  This is a great and wonderful thing because it represents the culmination of a significant amount of research and planning to find the right DSL provider for us.  We (I) chose Savvis because they have killer awesome customer service, guarantees on Uptime, guarantees on installation time, and nice price.  Unlimited free IP addresses.  They ping our router every 90 seconds to make sure it's awake.  Good stuff.  Oh, and they are the ISP for the ISP that hosts www.robnugen.com.  Nice.

<p>In addition to faxing the request, I got a lot done on my current HTML project for work.  I may have mentioned it before; the goal is to use cookies to save information on a users local machine (using a browser while OFFline (not on Internet) while they're on a plane or beach somewhere), and then allowing them to submit that data to us once they are back online.

<p>I dug through my code trying to see where to add a nicety and I noticed that I had gotten a bit sloppy with my 3 tier architecture (HI Maggie and Phil).  I sketched out a version of what the 3 tiers should be, and was able to knead my functions back in shape nicely.  (Marcel, this next part is for you)  I made the changes to code (moved 3 lines and added about 6 or 8 lines sprinkled throughout, changed 2 functions' input parameters, changed their corresponding function calls), and it worked.  No syntax errors.  No logic errors.

<p>AWESOME, BAAABYY!!!!!!!

<p>Okay, so now I'm about to go to Mad Potter again to show off my plate and say HI to (flirt with) some of my friends.
