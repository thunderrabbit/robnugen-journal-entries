Okay, I've been working on this for a while and have index.pl pretty
much working as I'd like it to.  Actually, I still have to let it
display images properly, but that shouldn't be too difficult.

I also would like it to know the date of the files in the directory.
The first two filenames in this dir have a 09 as their first two
characters.  To me it means they were written on the 9th.  I haven't
told index.pl to figure that out yet.  I'll get it.

ANNdd also I'd like to have index.pl send me email if it has any
errors.  That will be cool.
