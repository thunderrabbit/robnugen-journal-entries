Tonight I'm going on a date with myself.

I'm a pretty cheap date. I just want to listen to NIN and check out
The Simpson's at 7pm.

So I called Madeline to see if she wanted to watch Simpson's.  She was
all, "sure," and then, "you sound sad."

Hmmm.  What's that about? ... I wondered.  I recognized I was trying
to fulfill a need within myself by hanging out with her.  That's not
going to work.

She encouraged me to ask myself what I wanted to do and then simply do
it.  She was wonderfully more eloquent.

Thank you, M.
