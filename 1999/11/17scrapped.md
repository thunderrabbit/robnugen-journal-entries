<h1>Scrapped!</h1>

Well, archived.  It looks like my project that I've worked 2.5 weeks
on at work will be shelved until it may be needed again.  Mine used
JavaScript and HTML to store data on a users local machine while
offline and then allow them to submit the data to us when they were
back online again.

The biggest concerns were the wide variety of browsers and screen
sizes made the look-n-feel too varied across thousands of users.  I'm
cool with dat.

One "good" thing for me is that I get to move on to a different
project.  I like moving on to different projects; it's what I've done
all my life!

So now I'm looking for a unix daemon that will watch for email to a
certain address and strip attachments from the email to a certain
directory.

I wonder if I could just do it with pine???
