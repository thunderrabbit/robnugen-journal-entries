<p class=date>11:10am Sunday 28 November 1999</p>
<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

Friday I wasted time at the computer pretty much all day until 5-7pm
when I DJed at KTRU, covering for Jonathan and Sabrina.  After the show,
drove to Marcel and Kayse's for Thanksgiving Party.  Wende was 
there and I drove her back with me to KTRU from 11pm to 1am covering for
Tejus MK Ultra show.

After MK Ultra, I dropped Wende off at my apartment and I 
went back out to Montrose Radio <a
href="http:www.firstamendmentradio.org">www.firstamendmentradio.org</a>
which is rebroadcast illegally in Houston on 94.9fm with a 35 watt
transmitter.

Saturday Wende and I got up and wrote To Do lists and I cleared my table
(big success on my part) and then we put some shelves up in her apt.
Then to Molly and Will's (where Maggie and John are living while their
house is being built) and watched Clerks.  (I give it a 50% rating) Then
rode with Will and John to play Ultimate at UH (every Saturday night).

Played three games (won 1) and then Wende arrived just before we started
game 4, which my team barely won!  Sweet victory; I was so tired.  Wende
drove us to her apartment where we spent the night and where I am now
while she's at church.

  Clerks had a positive affect on (effect in) my life:  I am now more
committed to Wende, who would bring me lasagna to work (or steamed
broccoli).  I have been pestering Wende so crazy much for sex.  I
suddenly realized last night how self-centered my life is.  Also, I want
to make
my apartment more livable and hospitable for myself and others.  Right
now (and for the past 8 years (not including when girlfriends lived with
me) since Tammy moved out) it has been a dumpy bachelor pad.  I'm kinda
shifting toward keeping it fixed up and cleaned up.  Is this a new era
in my life?

Last night while talking with Wende I expressed how I felt self centered
and too pestery for sex and that I wanted that to change in my life. 
The dialogue was great; I want to continue it as far as we can.

We went to Family Planning clinic for HIV tests on Tuesday, but the
tester was on vacation so we made appointments for this coming Tuesday
at 4 and 4:30pm.  The test will be free (next week only; it's usually
$5) and results in 2 weeks.

Tossing around in bed this morning, I greatly encouraged Wende to get up
and go to church.  She did and now just called me to thank me for
getting her up.  It's 12:12 now and we're about to munch lunch.

        With Love
