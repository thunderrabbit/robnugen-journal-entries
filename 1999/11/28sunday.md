<p class=date>10:52pm Sunday 28 November 1999</p>
<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

Tonight Wende and I got our Water Altar diagram faxed to Richard and
then napped beautifully for 1.5 hours and then watched Simpson's and
Futurama for 1 hour and then ate Taco Bell and then had a spectacular
conversation.

Dumped out buckets worth of honesty and talk about sex and what it will
take for us (her) to trust each other (me).  Her need for me to say
clearly "I will not have sex with ____(girl-fixation of the week)____
while I'm dating Wende"  My need to sometimes say, "I want to have sex
with ______"  (but not do it; just know I 'want' to.  Similar to me
saying I have a crush on Kat (& Jen & Keirsten & Nancy & Sara & Sarah &
Laura).

About how foreplay ish type stuff doesn't <em>have</em> to lead to
intercourse.

And releasing old pains:  Wende felt <em>really</em> bad when I spent
the night with Diane so long ago.

Wende left without us having sex tonight.  The conversation gave me the
strength to simply put myself to bed to sleep.  Thank you dear friend
Wende.

	With Love
	- Rob
