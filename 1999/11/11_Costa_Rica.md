<p>Oh I keep forgetting!!!

<p>A few days ago, I got the following email:

<pre>

   From: Roni Kahn
Subject: Your Site and the Tabacon page
     To: thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom

Dear Rob,
 
I visited your web site regarding Costa Rica and stapled upon a page about Tabacon. 
 
My name is Roni Kahn and I'm the assistant marketing director of Tabacon, 
I was really impressed from your impression of Tabacon. If it's OK I would 
like to add a link to our official Tabacon web site form your page.
 
The URL is : <a href="https://www.tabacon.com">https://www.tabacon.com</a>
 
Thank you in advance, and I hope I will see you back in Tabacon very soon,
 
Roni Kahn
Assist.. Marketing Director
Tabacon Resort
Costa Rica.
