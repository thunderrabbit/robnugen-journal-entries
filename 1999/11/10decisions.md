<h1>DECISIONS</h1>

<p>As I begin this project of transferring my website to this new domain, I've had to make a few decisions.

<ul>
<p><li>To preserve and honor the past I will not change the color or style of old journal entries (before 1999).

<p><li>old journal entries should also stay as navigationally untampered as possible.  
<br>In pre 1998 journal directories:
  <br><ul>
  <li>index.html will have a link to /journal/index.pl
  <li>all other files will simply point back to their own index.html, and no further back than that.
  </ul>

<p><li>index.pl will be designed to only index new and future stuff.  This way it will be easier to write current stuff, and I won't have to spend a lot of time retrofitting old stuff.

<p><li>Everything below /journal dir is visible except index.pl

</ul>

<p>I will add to the list as needed.  It will just be sort of a record to help me with this process.
