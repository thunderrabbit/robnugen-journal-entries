Yesterday at KTRU I played an entire show (2 hours) of only bands that have
animal names in their name:

Band names like Iron Butterfly, Dead Horse, Hepcat, The Frogs, The Gerbils, 
Michelle Gun Elephant, Radiant Pig...  you get the idea.

I couldn't find enough such bands from playlist to meet playlist requirements
(4 from playlist per hour), so I played songs that had animals in the title.

AND!
I will be at KTRU thursday afternoon from 3-5pm and Friday afternoon
from 5-7pm  and Friday evening from 11pm to 1am.  Then I might be at
montrose radio from 1am to 3am.  Or not if I am too tired!

Montrose Radio?  Yes; they used to be a pirate station in Houston, but are
now Web based broadcast only:  <a href="http://www.firstamendmentradio.org">www.firstamendmentradio.org</a>.

I went to one of their meetings and I might begin to DJ there as well.
We'll see.

Drew sent us a funny turkey day picture:
