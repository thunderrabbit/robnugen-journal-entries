<p class=date>1:42pm Friday 17 December 1999</p>

<p>Today is our big DSL switchover day at work.  Well, actually it will be 
tonight.  Currently (until december 31st) we are paying for a full T1 line. 
 But we are using an embarassingly small fraction of the line.  Tiny small. 
 Average of 2kps with bursts as high as 200kps.  T1 is 1.5Mps, almost 1000 
times more than our highest bursts.

<p>Anyway, we are switching to DSL, with 416kps as our upper limit, for a 
fraction of the cost.  1/7th of the cost.  wait 3/14ths of the cost.  yeah.

<p>ANYWAY, I'm getting to learn all kinds of new and cool stuff!  How to 
set up a router; how to telnet to our routers to change their IP addresses. 
 How to change all the IPs in our NT network.  How to change the IP in our 
FreeBSD (unix) box.  How zone files direct all Internet traffic.  How to 
change domain information on interNIC with networksolutions.com. How to 
change the third level domain names of our machines.  Mine will be called 
rabbit.

<p>I love it!

<p>Oh..  one weird thing:  I was testing IP switching on a relatively 
unused machine, and noticed it had only 48 megs of memory.  I ripped out 
some memory from a different entirely unused machine to see if that would 
help.  (All the memory slots were full on the good machine, so I just 
replaced a couple of chips to see if the available memory would go up or 
down.  It went down to 40 megs.)

<p>During this process, I noticed the power supply fan wasn't spinning.  I 
tried to bring it back to life with a screwdriver (give the blades a push), 
but it didn't work.  So I couldn't boost the memory, but I did give it a 
new power supply!  Yay!

<p>With Love
