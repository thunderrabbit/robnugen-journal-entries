Okay.

Enough is just that; I'm going to leave my computer for a bit.  I
wrote the 03today.html entry this morning and had a reference to my
days old counter.  Last night, I swear it was working, but today it is
not.  Some problem with not being able to run an applet from within
the cgi-local directory.  Hmmm.

I'll ponder it later; but right now I'm going to work on my mountain
fountain!

Oh, also today I had to scrape together cash to pay for the ashford.com
stock I bought yesterday.  I am right now resisting looking up their 
market value.   good job!


   With Love
