<p>KTRU was great fun today!  I didn't have a theme, but had a few
excellent segues.  One was priceless!  I was playing the Sounds of North
American Frogs CD, which consists of hundreds of tracks.  Most of them
are about 17 seconds long (a few are longer) and of the following
format:

<pre>
This frog, the blahblahbinous blahvine, has a trill twitter sound much
like its cousin, the bluhvine bloovious.   

[Trrriiillllllllll]   [Trrrriiillllllll]    [Trrriiillllllllll]  
[Trrrriiillllllll]    [Trrriiillllllllll]   [Trrrriiillllllll]   
[Trrriiillllllllll]   [Trrrriiillllllll]    
</pre>

<p>The spoken part is a very dry humorless voice.  I played about 7
tracks and then just as he was done speaking, I cut off the frog CD and
started a throat singing of India CD, and it sounded so perfect!

<p>Anyone listening closely should have gotten a good chuckle.

<p>Wende and I are going to work on the mountain fountain!!
