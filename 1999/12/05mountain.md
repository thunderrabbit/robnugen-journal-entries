<p>The mountain is pretty much complete.  Well, except for the painting it part.  It basically looks like a big pile of shaving cream.  I love it!  I have had such big great fun building this thing, and testing it...  I think I will build a fountain to install permanently in my living room somewhere.  Some kinda fountain with a long and winding path for the water to traverse.

<p>Today we spent pretty much all day on this project, though a lot of time was required to simply let the Great Stuff harden for 2 hours after each application.  I worked on <a href="indigoangel.cjb.net">Indigo Angel</a> website during one 2-hour span, and in the next 2 hour span, Wende and I went to Indigo Angel where we grabbed some quartz crystals to decorate the mountain in some manner, and then zipped back home just in time to watch Simpsons and Futurama.

<p>From Indigo Angel, to Wende's house where she fed her cats and we peed.  Then she was all, "okay, let's grab a bite to eat at Taco Bell, then zip over to your house for The Simpsons."  It was 6:43; that left 17 minutes.  "C'mon let's go!"

<p>Zipped to Taco Bell; I dropped her off and turned the car around to wait for her.  Soon as she came out, I pulled out of the spot, she hopped in saying, "you're not going to believe this," and we sped away.

<p>"What, you forgot my taco?"

<p>"Nope."

<p>"You got Root Beer instead of Dr. Pepper?"

<p>"Nope."

<p>"What?"

<p>"They were out of cheese."

<p>"Heh.  That's funny."

<p>She wasn't kidding, but it is still funny.

<p>Zippy zipped home and ran upstairs.  Turned the TV on.  30 seconds later the chorus of voices called, "Ahhhhhh  The Simpsons..."

<p>I greatly enjoyed the episode.

<p>Futurama was pretty funny too.

<p>By then the mountain was ready for a test run.  Took it outside to the parking lot, tossed an extension cord out the window to run the pump, filled a bucket with water for the pump to use, plugged it all in, and watched it run, checking to see if the water would drain down the mountain the way I wanted.   Mostly it didn't, but simply poured down into holes between the lumps of hardened foam.  I marked the spots with a pen so I could fill them and try again.

<p>Filled the spots and I think it's pretty much ready to go.  I'm in the latter half of a 2 hour hardening phase.

<p>Work tomorrow and then on Tuesday we will all meet and hopefully get all this stuff finished up.

<p>With Love
