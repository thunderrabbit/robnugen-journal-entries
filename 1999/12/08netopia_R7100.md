noon Wednesday 8 December 1999

Today at work I'm reading all about Netopia R7100 router which we will use 
for SDSL soon.  258 page PDF document on the web.  I'll get to program the 
firewall and learn how to hook this sucker up to replace our T1 and its 
router.  I think it will practically be as simple as disconnecting one 
cable from the T1 router and connecting it to the DSL router.  Sweet!!

During testing, before this simple switchover, I think I'll have the DSL 
router connected directly to my machine so I can have a 416k modem all to 
myself!  "oh yes sir, I'm still testing it.  Probably a couple more days to 
make sure it's perfect."

	With Love
