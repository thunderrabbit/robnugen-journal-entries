Okay, I'm moving my site again.  Even though it was never totally moved 
in the first place.  However, this new ISP <a href="http://www.webquarry.com/cgi-bin/webrefer.cgi?wquser=rob">webquarry.com</a> seems like it
will be a much happier place for my site to live.  I'm messing with a lot
of perl stuff, and the other ISP just wasn't conducive (sp) to easy perl
writing.  I asked them if I could have access to the error output of my
perl scripts and the answer I got was, "if you have an error in your script,
you just need to have someone who knows perl go over your code with you."

WHAT???

I tried again to explain that I wasn't asking for them to fix my code, just
give me the output.

He understood what I meant and suggested the same thing.

Tsk.  That began the end of my dealings on that ISP.

The cost is a bit more here at webquarry, but I have access to the logs!
And I have a shell account!  And I get helpful customer service!!!

Yay!
