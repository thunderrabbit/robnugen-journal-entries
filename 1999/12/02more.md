<p class=date>1:56am Thursday 2 December 1999</p>

Okay; I've just transcribed about 4 days worth of stuff onto my site. 
Mostly from the end of November, all transcribed from my diary.

My goal is to get the front page of my site set up tomorrow and begin
directing traffic over here.  It's time to quit putzing around with this
thing and actually move away from Geocities!

Have a great night and stuff!

	With Love
