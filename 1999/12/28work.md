<p class=date>1:33pm Tuesday 28 December 1999</p>

<p>The countdown continues.  I think that this year the New Year will not 
be such a shock to me when it arrives since I've been thinking about it SO 
Much..  It won't sneak up on me.  I mean, jeez- I've got a counter counting 
down the seconds until the moment comes!

<p>Today at work has been slow.  I am mostly waiting for our new computers 
to come in so I can install Win NT 4.0 on them.  Maybe I should begin 
reading about that process.

<p>Because it's been so slow, I invited Channing to BBS Thingie, a web 
based BBS not-realtime chat area that is quite remniscent of the lovely 
Castle of Dreams.

<p>It's at <a 
href="http://www.geeky-boy.com/cgi-bin/bbs_thingie">http://www.geeky-boy  
.com/cgi-bin/bbs_thingie</a>.  If you come join us, feel free to say HI in 
the Introduction area (a sub-item of Misc), or just run around all the 
areas!

<p>I think I mentioned that I purchased tickets to a rave on New Year's 
Eve.  I got tix for myself and Wende.  She doesn't feel comfortable 
attending on this particular night, so I have decided to sell the tickets 
(not scalp them) at the door and just skate around downtown with Wende.  It 
should still be lots of delightful fun watching the wild entertainment in 
the streets.
