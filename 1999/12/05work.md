Yay!

Great fun at work today; got to learn some new SAS stuff.  I pretty much 
don't like the language - it's not strictly structured like C, sloppy 
variable typing and sloppy function calls.  but I can handle it!

Oh, and the best thing of all- I asked if I could be paid today for the 
past week of work instead of waiting until next official payday, and Karla 
was like, "no problem!"

YAY!  I need the cashola to cover the cost of the water altar and stuff. 
 And to buy some happy gifts for my homies!

See ya!

	With Love
