I was on KTRU today "helping" Alexis interview a guy named Philip
Gayle.  At first I was anti-impressed with the interview; it seemed
trite and unprepared.  But that sponteneity really became great fun!  So
I went out there to see them.

I say "helping" because I was an unplanned uninvited guest.  But Alexis
was happy to have me join.

Philip Gayle is just a solo artist.  He had 2 little mandolins and would 
make up songs:
"I call this one 'I have too much sugar in my chloaca'"  and just scribble
and scratch the strings, for a full five minutes, including licking his 
fingers and rubbing/squeaking the wooden surface of the mandolin...
crazy!

Alexis is fun; she helped train me as a DJ when I first started working
at KTRU, and now I randomly call her or say HI at her show.  She never
comes to see me... hmmm.
