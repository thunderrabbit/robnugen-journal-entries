<p class=date>21 December 1999</p>

<p>Today I had a most cool day at work.  Mostly I researched/designed some new computers for work to be our new web server and its data server.  I was given a $10,000 limit for the two machines.  Nice.  The plan is to get the following:

<pre>
web server:             data server:
dual PIII 600mhz        PIII 500mhz
256 meg ram             128 meg ram
13 gig ultra 2 scsi     RAID 5 using four 13 gig ultra 2 scsi on hotswappable backplane
8 gig tape backup       Adaptec controller with >= 64 meg cache
two NICs                8 gig tape backup
etc                     two NICs
                        etc
</pre>

<p>One pair of NICs (Network Interface Cards) will connect each machine to our hub.  The other pair will be used to connect the two machines into their own private network so they can talk super fast without bogging down our hub.

<p>I don't have a price quote yet, but I should get that tomorrow early.  Nice!!!

<p>Super special thanks to my homey John for giving me fine tune points on the RAID 5 setup, and on the NICs.

<p>In other news, I'm all "GRRrrr" at a guy who was all, "oh sure I'll do it" and never did it, and over the past couple weeks I've been cleaning up for him, and I just got an email from him, "please finish up because January is my deadline."

<p>I'm just pissed at him for not doing the work he said he would do in the first place.  No, .. not pissed, but more like disgusted at his lack of integrity.

<p>(I'm being purposely vague about the details of this, but I'll mention it has nothing to do with work.)

<p>In other news, I'm trying to get emacs to save a macro for me to make journal writing easier.  I sent an email to my brother (at least I hope it actually sent (it was a pretty funny email)) asking him how to do it.

<p>Fewer than 900,000 seconds to year 2000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<p>With Love
