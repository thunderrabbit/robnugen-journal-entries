<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

I'm in College Station now after a candle light service at church.  (My
mom is a UU minister)  The service was full of carols and candles, but I
didn't feel much like participating; my nose was all snuffly and stuff. 
It's not the same here without Fred.  Also conspicuously missing is
Karina, me an' Fred's step sister, although Alicia is here (our other
step-sis), but she is not a boistrous as Karina.

Big stuff recently:

1) I am HIV negative
2) I switched our ISP at work (T1 to DSL)
3) We got nice Christmas bonuses at work $473, which ain't much, 
   but a ton more than at Telecheck
4) I'm in the process of moving my website to robnugen.com
5) Wende and I are exclusively dating
6) I'm still climbing out of debt
7) Yahoo (YHOO) stock is going crazy up: $405/share now; 
   I bought 5 at $209
8) I wrapped Fred's gift ridiculously tightly in some 20 layers 
   of tape and cardboard and wrapping paper.

Oh my goodness; I got up to P and Ma was awake, just chillin' drinking
some hot tea.  We talked a bit and she got sleepy and then I was awake
so I started calling my credit card companies to see where exactly my
balances are.  Talked to Jennifer, who, for Christmas, removed $40
finance charge!!  My remaining balance was only $50 (it had been $3000,
but I transferred the balance to a different card) and I had her pay the
rest via phone, and <em>bang</em> the card is paid off!

I'm gonna send her a thank you note!
