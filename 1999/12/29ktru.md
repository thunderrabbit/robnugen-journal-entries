KTRU was great fun today!  I recorded my show (recorded 2 hours of my 3
hour show) for Channing, a youth in Tulsa, who was really excited to
expand his musical awareness!  I think Side A is more musically
expanding...

But!!  The coolest thing:  A guy called in; "Will you play something by
Squarepusher?"  (I gave my standard non-committal answer; I didn't know
if I could find it).

I followed my guess to some hip hop LPs and saw Latyrx on one of the
sleeves.  "Latyrx!  I saw them at the DJ Shadow concert!"  Pulled it
out, and found misfiled in that sleeve, Squarepusher.  For real!  And
that was like 20 seconds after I hung up the phone with the guy who
requested it!

I cued it, played it, got a phone call from the same guy.  "Thanks,
bro.  But you're playing it at the wrong speed."  

DOH!  Sure enough, a large "45" was slowing spinning around at 33 1/3
rpm.  "Shall I change it?"

He said, "nah; I've never heard it at this speed before."

I let the song complete its slow play, then relayed the funny rotation
speed story over the air and played a portion of it at the correct
speed.  "So imagine what you just heard being played at this speed and
there you go."

Faded the song out, "And here is Sonic Youth as Ciccone Youth playing
'HI Everybody'" and doh!! I played it at the wrong speed!!!  Aaauhh!! I
fixed this one in within the first 10 seconds..

With Love
