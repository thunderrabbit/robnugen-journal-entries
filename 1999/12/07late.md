<p class=date>23:47 Tuesday 7 December 1999</p>

Wende and I spent the greater portion of today down south of downtown,
mostly at Ares Robotics where we are working on all four different
altars.  When we arrived, the table for the water altar had no legs and
no top. It was just a frame of two-by-fours.  A man named Terry worked
on it, adding the legs, reinforcing them, then adding the top.

During this time Wende and I spray painted our mountain fountain, first
with a rust proof primer, and then with two different colors of fleck
paint.  We spent a lot of time just waiting around until finally Wende
had to leave around 5:45pm.  It was difficult for us to feel like our
time was being used wisely; we played some, talked some, but mostly just
waited.

After Wende left, I drove down to Garden Ridge Pottery to find some fake
moss to line the bottom of the altar.  They didn't have plastic moss,
but some wood shavings painted dark green and light brown.  I bought 18
one pound bags of the wooden fake moss.  $2.88 + tax per bag.

Then to Home Depot where I bought a pump that will pump water up to the
top of the altar to rain back down upon it.  $52 + tax for it.

Back to Ares Robotics where I tested out the pump - it could spray a
spout about 4 feet in the air without a hose attached.  Nice!

It was pretty late so I headed home.  Wende completed her meeting and we
went to Taco Bell!  (Do you see a trend?)
