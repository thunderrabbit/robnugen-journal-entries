<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

Yesterday Fred and I rode his unicycle around more and tossed my new
frisbee-ish thing (collapseable hinged ring) and then I went home.  My
butt hurts from unicycling.

Today Channing IMed me and asked about KTRU.  After I told him all our
music types, he was all, "what's Navrang?"  I told him it was music from
India (but I'm afraid even that might be wrong), and that's all I know. 
Turns out he was able to listen on RealAudio, so I called Alison at the
station and requested some Navrang for him.

On the air, she prepended the song, "this is for a request in Tulsa."

Channing loved it!  He asked if I would tape a copy for him.  No sweat.

Work was short and sweet (I ate a lot of chocolate) and we got paid
early ("Just in case you might need the cash around Y2K").  Phat.  I
love my job!
