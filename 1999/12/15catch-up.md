Okay.

It's been a week.

The Techno Cosmic Mass was pretty cool, but not super hella crazy phat
awesome like I had hoped!

Great pics though, and I scanned them and will put them up here
soon!!!!!  I promise!!

That Thursday I was at Ares Robotics at like 7:30am.  Wes and I
listened to Sarah on KTRU, and I called her a couple of times; she
said she would be on the air until 9:00pm, which was funny cause she
had just said, "I'm so awake!"

I took four pictures of the altars before any work was done on them
that day:

The top blue thing was a shower curtain.  Here it is tacked on, with
the water fountain <a

Drove everything up there to the George R. Brown and began to put it
all together.

In the center of the room was a big structure.  Here is <a href="/journal/images/TCM/wes.jpg">Wes</a> on it.

A <a href="/journal/images/TCM/video.jpg">video</a> crew recorded the event.  They didn't record me <a href="/journal/images/TCM/rob-lights.jpg">decorated</a>.

Dion, worked on the entrance, while Marisol showed off sleepy <a href="/journal/images/TCM/akira.jpg">Akira</a>

The event started at 7pm.  I took pictures of all four altars.  Hmm. I
thought I did, but I musta only scanned two.

I loved my water altar!  I took an <a href="/journal/images/TCM/water-art.jpg">artsy</a> pic of it.

There was a gospel singer and a <a href="/journal/images/TCM/rap.jpg">rapper</a>, and dancers and 
all kinds of fun.

Some funny person put a bar of <a href="/journal/images/TCM/soap-frog.jpg">soap</a> in the water altar!  
The funniest thing is that someone <em>had</em> a bar of soap at the
event!

Dion took this picture of <a href="/journal/images/TCM/rob-frog.jpg">me</a> after the event.  My fingers 
were wrapped up after I reinjured an old injury.

Afterward, we packed up the good stuff, threw away the rest and went
home.
