<p class=date>1:35am</p>

I logged 11 hours today, 9 of which go to DSL switchover.

Was not able to get the mail server happy.  We can receive email, but
not send it; the mail server thinks our new IP addresses are hackers
trying to use our server as a mail relay.  (This is a technique used
to spam people; our server won't allow it.)  I don't know where to add
our IP addresses and say, "hey!  we have new IPs!"

I also couldn't get our printers' IPs changed.  After I changed all
the computer IPs, I realized I had forgotten the printers.  I couldn't
telnet to them because the IPs were different; so I called Brian who
suggested connecting it directly to my computer (I'd have to change my
IPs back to old IPs first) but I couldn't get that to work.  Pooh.

Sweet and Wonderful Wende brought dinner over at around 9pm; we ate
and talked for an hour then she slept on the couch until I could no
longer think coherently.  Bed bed bed.

With Love
- Rob
