After I-Group last night I zipped over to the 24-hour Home Depot to get
more Great Stuff and some stone colored spray paint.  Called Wende from
the store to see if I was forgetting anything.

"Will that Stuff work to seal the gap around my air conditioner?"  She
has asked her landlord to fix it since the summer.

"That's exactly what it's for!"

"Can you get an extra bottle of Great Stuff for me?"

"Sure!"

I grabbed 2 more bottles; something told me I would need them for the
mountain.

Drove home and turned my mountain upside down to try to seal the holes
from the inside.  It did take all three bottles; I sprayed a layer from
the center of the cone most of the way toward the top.

At 10pm we went to Mission Burrito while we let it harden for 2 hours.

Ate burritos (and a bit of Amy's Ice Cream) and then headed home.

It was 11:10; and I turned on my little portable gas heater (old timey
kind with decorative ceramic bricks) cause it's getting cool (40F at
night).  We sat in front of it under my comforter, as if in front of a
roaring fireplace.

At 11:20 Wende was all, "let's take a nap for 40 minutes until it's
done."

We lay snuggled in bed and suddenly, it was morning.
