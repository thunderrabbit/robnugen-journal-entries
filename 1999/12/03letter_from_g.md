It's becoming more apparent that I could greatly benefit from having a
bike here on campus.  Campus is 2-3 times bigger than that of UH's, and
I have to walk quite a bit to get from my dorm (thankfully not situated
along the perimiter of campus) to the engineering building (about a
12-minute walk across the center of campus) or the math building (about
4-5 minutes away from the eng building, and 8-10 from my dorm) or the
place where I eat dinner (about 7-9 minutes away from my dorm, 15-17
minutes from the eng building, and 18-20 minutes from the math building).
(Now draw a map.  Assume every path is a line segment; assume my walking
speed is a constant small enough that the curvature of the earth and
topography of ground level are negligible.)  

I had wanted to get a BMX bike I could do tricks on like I see some of the
neighborhood kids doing occasionally: hopping up onto two-foot benches,
hopping up onto them so that they land--stopped--on their back tire
perched on the corner of the thing and then bounce once or twice before
hopping backward off it again; hopping up, riding along the bench, then
flipping a 180 off the other end, riding backwards--and pedaling
backwards, just for effect; flatfoot bunnyhopping sideways up onto the
bench; fuckin' cool stuff.  

But I don't have time to teach myself those tricks.  I need something
cool that won't fall by the wayside: a unicycle.  Not a single one have I
seen yet.  There're characters riding all kinds of shit: bikes, concept
bikes, rollerblades, normal skateboards, big ol' long skateboards, tiny
two-wheeled contraptions that are crosses between skateboards and
scooters, but no unicycles.  That will all change.  

Hopefully it won't take long to learn to ride.  

Gotta go.  It's time to get back to work.
