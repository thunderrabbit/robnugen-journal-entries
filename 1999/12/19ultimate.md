<p class=date>2:34am Sunday 19 December 1999</p>

<p>Today at work, with significant help from David and Brian, we got all our DSL related problems solved, except we still can't send email.  Brian believes it's cause our ISP didn't set up our reverse-DNS-lookup tables.  We can ask for the IP address of a machine name, but not for the machine name of one of our IP addresses.

<p>Then I helped Liz at <a href="https://www.blanketstoyou.com">Blankets To You</a> get set up on a new ISP.  Didn't actually get her set up yet, but began the process of getting her account created there.  She'll have a real shopping cart once it's complete!

<p>Bought Taco Bell on the way home and met Wende at my house.  We ate and she talked about her day and then I went to Ultimate at 10:35pm.

<p>Very few people showed up, and we spent about 40 minutes literally just standing in the parking lot, talking our geek/fireworks/D&D/ultimate talk.  The temperature was deemed too cold so we caravaned to House of Pies.

<p>Now I get to the point of my whole story.  I didn't have shoes.  Well I actually had sandals under my carseat, but I wanted to try something not outrageous, but memorable enough to get a good story out of it.

<p>I pulled my sweatpants down just a little bit, and covered up my feet with them!

<p>I appeared to be wearing pajamas with feet sewn into them, and got a few giggles or looks from various people and the waitstaff.  I felt a tad nervous that they would say something, but they didn't.  Yay!

<p>Great coversation and I told a joke:

<pre>
A priest, a minister and a rabbi walked into a bar.  
The bartender said, "what is this, some kind of joke?"
</pre>

<p>When I first wrote the joke to Rocky yesterday morning over AIM, I typed 

<pre>
A priest, a minister and a rabbit walked into a bar.  
The bartender said, "what is this, some kind of joke?"
</pre>

<p>I like this version even better!

<p>With Love
