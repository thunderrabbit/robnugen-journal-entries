<p class=date>26 January 1999</p>

<p>Oh my goodness.

<p>Though I was sicker than a proverbial dog, I lay in bed and visualized her winning.  Over and over I visualized Amanda winning Miss Houston 1999.

<p>I had called her at 3 and told her "you can do it."

<p>I had called her at 6 and left a message, "you can do it."

<p>The pageant started at 7pm, and I cried since I couldn't be there.  :'(

<p>I visualized her winning until I fell asleep.

<p>I got a call at 10:30pm.  "Hello?"

<p>It was Amanda. "You're not going to believe it."

<p>"You won."

<p>"Totally."

<p>"I love you."

<p>"I love you, too.  But I gotta go take pictures and stuff."

<p>"Congratulations."

<p>And I went back to sleep.  Wow.  Amanda is Miss Houston 1999.
