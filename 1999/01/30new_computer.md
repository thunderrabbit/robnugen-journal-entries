<p class=date>30 January 1999</p>

<p>A few days ago, my machine locked up and then wouldn't reboot. It would try to boot, but where the boot manager would normally prompt with

<p><pre>
LILO:
</pre>

<p>so I could type in whether I wanted to boot linux or Windows, now it just said

<p><pre>
LI
</pre>

<p>and wouldn't do nothin.

<p>Hmmm.. I was able to boot with a floppy, and even (thankfully) read all the info on this otherwise unbootable hard drive.  I had 2 other drives, so copied all the info I wanted to save onto one drive and took it out of the mix.

<p>I tried every combination I could think of, used FDisk and Partition Magic and formatted and installed boot managers and everything, but I couldn't get it to go.

<p>So I bought a new machine.

<p>Actually I put it on credit card (ack).  $900 but it is a sweet sweet system:
<br><ul>
<li>PII 350Mhz CPU
<li>100Mhz ATX mainboard
<li>64Megs ram
<li>8Gig ide HD
<li>32x CD
<li>Voodoo Banshee video card with 16megs on it
<li>3.5 inch floppy
<li>56k internal modem
<li>Soundblaster card
</ul>

<p>All of the above components came separately, and my friend <a href="mailto:thomas@net-help.net">Thomas</a> helped me put it all together.  I used my current monitor, keyboard, mouse, speakers and all is good.

<p>Okay, actually all is pretty good; last night the video card was killer awesome, but today a driver is screwed up or something and I've only got 640x480 pixels and the fonts are <font size="+1"><b>this big</b></font>!! I'll call Thomas and see if he can help me out with that.

<p>Yay new machine!

<p>So I'm catching up on email and stuff now.
