Rad (Rob) - My name is Dude Spellings, and I couldn't help but notice
your advertisement on the back of my Kroger's reciept with your cartoon
character saying my name.  Anyway, I am between jobs right now and into
designing webpages.  If you have a need for an extra web designer, I
would love to help ya'll out.  If you want to see an example of one of
my pages. check out my site at:
<a href="http://freeweb.pdq.net/dude1">http://freeweb.pdq.net/dude1</a>
I also have some really cool photos of my hike last summer from Lake
Tahoe to Mt. Whitney.  My website is not all that advanced and I don't
claim to be an expert, but I would really like a good reason to lern
more web-designing skills.  At the very least, it would be nice to make
a new friend.

Let me know if you are interested.  I am going to Austin this weekend
and will be back monday.  You can either respond by e-mail or phone.  My
number is 713.___.____.

Peace,
Dude

Rob - I just finished looking at the rest of your website and have
decided that I would like to meet you regardless of is you need another
web-designer.  We have many things in common and I would like to make
more friends here in Houston.

A bit about myself:
- I am also around 10,000 days old.
- I have made a personal promise to myself that the next permanent job
that I take will not require me to wear any shoes aside from sandals.
- I love working with youth and am very spiritual (religion is to teach
people how to die.  Spirituality is to teach people how to live).
- One of my favorite books is The Road Less Traveled, which I believe to
be devinely inspired.  Another is The Prophet, by Kalil Gibran
- I love camping/hiking/biking and anything outdoors.
- I am married to a great, loving, and supportive wife who is also an
M.D.

I hope to hear from you.

peace,
Dude

Dude!

Is your name really Dude?

My friend Marcel and I call each other Dude all the time.  Sometimes we
have entire conversations using only tonal variations of this word.

Speaking of Marcel, I forwarded to him your email messages (and this
one) because this connection is just to awesome for me to not tell him!

I super greatly appreciate that you enjoyed my ad and my website!

Now if someone would actually want a website, we could do some work! 
;-)  

Seriously, that ad is almost the only advertising I've done for MR Labs;
I couldn't afford any more and I have actually shifted focus a tad; I am
now selling FlashNet accounts to anyone who needs internet access.
Happily enough, I'm finding that I can sell internet accounts more
easily than websites, so hey - whatever works.

enough about business...

Wow!!!  And you're up late at night doing email just like me!  I hear
you will be out of town this weekend; that is convenient; I will too. I
look forward to meeting you probably next week!

I would write more but I have to leave in about 4.4 hours to catch a
plane to Atlanta.  Have a great weekend in Austin!

        With Love
        - Rob

<p>That weekend, I went to Atlanta.

<p>The following Monday, having had no further contact with Dude, I
went to a class called <a
href="http://www.jeffdurstconsulting.com/heart.htm">Project
Heart</a>. I opened the door for a guy who came in right after me.

<p>It was Dude.

<p>"!!??!!??!!??!!" went my brain.  The first coherent thought that came to mind was, "I guess we were meant to meet."

<p>We have hung out and worked a lot on MR Laboratories since then; I am really glad to have Dude as a friend.
