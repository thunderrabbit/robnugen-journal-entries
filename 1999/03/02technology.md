<p>Technology is pretty amazin'.  Dude and I have been chatting over ICQ and working on a new website.  Free of charge (given the computer and phone line) we have used a <a href="https://www.geocities.com">geocities</a> website for 11 megs of space, an <a href="https://www.iname.com">iname</a> email address, and a <a href="https://www.listbot.com">listbot</a> email list for this new website (for a non profit organization that can't really afford anything).

<p>But I'm just marveling that all this is like <em>free</em> and just <b>out there</b> to be used, and I'm sure there's tons more that we simply haven't seen yet.

<p>Plus, chatting over <a href="https://www.icq.com">ICQ</a> our two apartments, which are physically 2+ miles apart, are suddenly virtually side by side in the MR Laboratories virtual office.

<p>I'm going to actually go outside now and help Wende move.
