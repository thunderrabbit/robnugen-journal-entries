<p class=date>2:47pm CST Friday 19 March 1999</p>

<p>Oh, I forgot to mention that yesterday was Maggie and Molly's birthday! They are twins; Maggie was my best friend in college.

<p>Today Dude and I met with a guy for whom we will be doing some cable work (pulling voice and data cable in a new building for them). It should be a pretty sweet deal. We get $25 per cable that we do and he taught us some techniques that should make it go super quickly. There's over 100 cable; maybe even 150, so we should make several dollars.

<p>Then we met with a man from my church who wants us to build a website for him. We got the domain set up and will begin work today. We got some ideas for what he wants and some content to start with and it should be pretty cool. He's paying us $45 per hour.

<p>Dollars are finally beginning to come join my life since I quit work in the corporate world on 19 June 1998.  Yay!

<p>With these dollars I intend to purchase more stock and ride more roller coasters and pay rent and stuff.
