<p class=date>17 March 1999</p>

<p>Some days ago, I put $1500 into a discount brokerage in order to purchase FlashNet stock when it debuted yesterday.

<p>Because it's an internet stock, it's considered volatile. Because it's volatile, I was not allowed to place an order at <em>Market Value</em>, which means, "I don't care what price, just buy it."  So I said, "um, how about I'll buy it if it's less than $25."

<p>Yesterday, FlashNet opened in the primary market at $17. That's for the homies who know the right people to buy it at the initial offering price. It hit the secondary market at $39. So my order did not go through. My inner guidance suggested that I just let it go for the day and order some again today.

<p>I just called and spoke with L__ at the brokerage L asked how many shares I wanted.

<p>"I want as many as I can buy when it opens."

<p>L said okay, at what stop limit? (highest price the customer is willing to pay)

<p>"I don't care what price."

<p>Nope.

<p>"So wait, if I say, I want it if it's below 1 million dollars per share, I'll get 1 share, but only if I have 1 million dollars in my account."

<p>Yup.

<p>"And if I say I want it at whatever price, you say no because it's volatile."

<p>Yup.

<p>[sigh] "Okay, gimme however many I can get if it's less than $50 per share."  (Current market value is $44)

<p>"That will be almost 30 shares but you'll owe us $12 commission."

<p>"I assume you cannot spot me twelve dollars."

<p>L laughed.

<p>"I'm not entirely joking; if you can do it, I'll be glad to pay ya back."

<p>"You'll have to pay us within 3 days."

<p>"So I could just drive over with a check and it's all good?"

<p>"You could even mail it."

<p>So there it is; I made my order and US markets open in 40 minutes. We'll see what happens.
