<p class=date>Thursday 18 March 1999</p>

<p>Today I woke up and was all, "whoah! my alarm didn't go off!" I looked at the clock and it was only 2:30.  Whew.  Turned on the radio. static. Hmmm. no one at the station. Will I be able to get into the building? Hmm. I visualized myself being able to simply walk into the building and fell back to sleep.  Woke up at 3:00 and turned off the alarm, which had not yet sounded.

<p>Got to Rice and walked right in the building; the door was slightly ajar (when is a door not a door?) and there were peeps in there studying and stuff.  No problem.

<p>Into the station by like 3:20 and had to pee!!  Peed, back to the station (I remembered the code this time) and I even knew how to turn on the station.  I put my tape in and turned on the mic. "You are listening to...."  I paused until the monitors switched from static to clear.  "K T R U Houston."  and I read the MRA On (to be read each time the station is turned on.)

<p>The shift was great; I only had a few errors, and I got them on tape pretty much, which is cool. I've had grand thoughts of recording them from tape to digital and then onto a CD, but I certainly won't expect that to happen anytime soon!  

<p>I got a couple requests. I was able to play one, but the other two were from Wende calling in for Spice Girls and for Madonna. I recognized her sleepy voice and was all, "Um, I don't think we have any Spice Girls... and if we did, I wouldn't play them because they suck!!!"  I was just jokin' of course as my way of saying, "HI Wende; I recognize your voice."

<p>'twas a fun show.

<p>Slept, cleaned, went shopping.  Had an overwhelming feeling of blug and if I were a dog I woulda just bit someone. I'm not really sure of what the "problem" is; but half of me is happy feelin' great like my whole life is lined up nicely, and half of me is still unsettled. 

<p>So I had a dialogue with my higher self.  "What's the deal?" I asked.

<p>"You feel your life is too complicated; wake up early each day and meditate for some minutes and figure out what you need to do that day. Do those things and then be complete for the day, and feel okay with being complete for the day. If you get them all done, then you are done."

<p>Hmmm.

<p>"You've got a lot of living left to live.  Stay healthy so you can do it all. There are more things left in your life than you could possibly imagine at this moment. Entire other life situations will be yours. Keep living and let them arrive as they will."

<p>Hmmm.
