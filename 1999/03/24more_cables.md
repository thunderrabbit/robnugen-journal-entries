<p>Okay.  I have just slept for 7 hours after working hard pulling cables yesterday.  It took us 5 hours to fix the 20 cables and get 9 more cables pulled implicitly.  That doesn't make sense.   Here's a wonderful graphic:

<pre>
Original configuration:

@==========================================#

@ = the original telecom room
# = the end of the 10 cables
= = the 10 cables.



New configuration:

%-------------------$======================#

$ = the new telecom room (along the original path)
# = the end of the 10 cables 
= = 10 cables to the original end
- = 9 cables we were able to salvage from the original 10
as they follow the same path the 10 had used..

</pre>

<p>Maybe that helps.

<p>Anyways, that took 5 hours and then in the subsequent 3.5 hours we did 15 more cables.

<p>I went home, slept, got up, and as I wrote this entry, I ICQ chatted with one of my youth.  The dialogue was quite intriguing, about him being bothered by a discarnate spirit.
