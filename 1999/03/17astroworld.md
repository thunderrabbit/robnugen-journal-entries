<p class=date>17 March 1999</p>

<p>Hrmmm..

<p>On Saturday I went to Astroworld!  It was opening day for the park and it was cold!!  Actually the wind helped chill things more than the actual temperature, but overall this was great because only a few people were in the park!

<p>Though the lines were short I have good and bad (sad (kinda)) news.  The bad kinda sad news is that Excalibur has been removed from Astroworld.  My understanding is that it has been sold to Frontier City, a park on I-35 in Oklahoma.  It's in storage now and will be assembled for 2000 season.

<p>Excalibur was a mine train coaster built in 1972. It was the first significant coaster at Astroworld. I talked to one of the maintenance guys who had worked at Astroworld for a while. He said that Excalibur was a fine ride, but didn't draw the people to the park. I said, "it drew *me* to the park!" 
<br>He said with a smile, "you'll like the new one better."

<p>Good news is that a new ride called Serial Thriller will take its place.  It should be installed by Memorial Day 1999. Serial Thriller will be an SLC (Suspended Looping Coaster) the maintenance guy said.  It allows riders' legs to dangle like a ski lift, and will have <em><b>FIVE</b></em> inversions!!!

<p>Right now, however, there's just dirt where Serial Thriller will stand.  I got pictures of the dirt, and of the metal tubing holder things that will be the frame of the coaster.

<p>I took 30 some odd pics from Astroworld including while on the
following rides: Viper, XLR8, Greezed Lightnin', Batman, Ultra Twister, Cyclone, Mayan Mindbender.

<p>Texas Tornado (no longer Taz's Texas Tornado) was not running while I was in the park. Actually it was running, but with no riders.

<p>These are pics for my book, _Rob's Rollercoaster Roundup_.
