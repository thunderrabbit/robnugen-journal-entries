<p>My Aunt Mercedes died a few days ago. She had pretty bad and icky cancer all over, so I'm glad that she's no longer suffering from that.

<p>She remains a super great loving wonderful memory in my mind. I appreciate all the care she gave to her kids and us.

<p>Today Fred is driving down from Denton to Houston and he and I will drive over to Slidell, Louisiana, a trip we've taken several times with lots of fun memories.

<p>I've got to go pack and stuff.

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
