<p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>

<p><ol>

<p><li>Manda has been found. She was never lost, but got swamped with school and Miss Texas preparations and life in general. When I got to talk with her, I said I was super glad she's busy, and asked that she simply let me know she's okay if she misses a meeting or date or something.

<p><li>Yesterday I got a call from KTRU. <b>I got a job as a DJ there!!</b> I am so so so super pumped excited and wow!! We have a training / meeting thing at 2pm this Sunday and I am psyched!!
I'll get to say stuff like, "You are listening to ninety-one point seven F M, K-Truue!!!"

<p><li>Dude and I finished recreating MR Labs website!  We were up until 5am this morning, with a goal to get it complete before he left at 2:30pm for 8 days in Nicaragua.  Check it out at <a href="http://www.mrlaboratories.com">www.mrlaboratories.com</a> Wheeee!!!!

<p><li>Today at around 1:30pm after I woke up at noon, I heard a lot of clippin' and cloppin' outside my front windows..  It was a trail ride walking down the street - bunch of people on horses and a couple wagons and a police car at each end.  Wow!  So I put on my skates and caught up with them about a mile down the street.

<p>I waved and talked to a couple of the riders and one guy, Larry, was all, "grab onto my horses tail and I'll pull you!"

<p>I'm like, "um, um.." and didn't do it.

<p>Then another woman offered the same thing and I was all, "but what if he kicks?"

<p>"He won't kick!" piped up a woman behind her as she tugged on the horse's tail. "See?"

<p>Cool.  So I grabbed firmly but gently onto her horse's tail and ziinngg!! She took off at a trot up along the rest of the riders!  Wow!  I got pulled on skates by a horse!  I did it 2 more times, once with the first girl and once with Larry, and I gave someone my camera to take a picture, so I will hopefully have one on the site soon!

<p><li>Dude and I worked dutifully on MR Labs website, but today he has left for Nicaragua for 8 days or so.  I've been spending so much time with him that I hardly will know what to do!

<p>But we've got some clients lined up, so I'll be creating some websites, including one for writers and one for an artist to advertise her work.
