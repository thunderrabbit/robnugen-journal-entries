<p class=date>5am Sunday 28 February 1999</p>

<p>"Tonight" Jen and I went to Packers Falls, a waterfall area on the Lamprey river a few miles from her house. We literally just sat on the brilliant white snow, listening to the white noise gussshhhhhh of water falling over the rocks.

<p>It was pretty cold, but I was wearing 2 pairs of socks, shoes, undies, shorts, two pairs of sweat pants, t-shirt, sweat shirt, knit hat, hoodie, big winter coat and gloves. We were also sitting on a blanket and coat spread onto the ground.

<p>We went in after like 30 minutes of meditative silence; Jen had gotten cold since she was wearing only like pants, socks, shoes, sweat shirt, jacket, hat, gloves.

<p>Got back to her house like at 4am and showed her roommmate Ray (short for Rachael) pictures from Costa Rica.  She had just gotten home a few hours earlier, my first time to meet her and we talked but hadn't looked at pictures yet.  Ray lived in Costa Rica for a while and showed me lots of her pictures too.

<p>I gotta be awake in a few hours to panic pack and leave.
