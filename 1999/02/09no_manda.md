<p class=date>9:36pm Tuesday 9 February 1999</p>

<p>On Sunday night, Manda picked me up from the airport. I told her about the whole weekend and totally fell asleep with the understanding that I would see her on Monday at Project Heart.

<p>I didn't talk to her all day Monday, which was okay; she's got school and I had 71 email messages and website stuff with Dude, but she didn't show up to Project Heart.

<p>Hmmm.  I called her afterward and left messages on her cell phone and home phone.

<p>That night I talked to Brandie and converted pennies into susan b anthony dollars.

<p>Now Tuesday is well underway and I still haven't heard from her.

<p>My angels say she's okay, but I'm just writing to express my concern and sadness and to say, "hey, I miss you."

<p>Today Dude and I worked more on MR Labs, and plan to unveil the new site at <a href="http://www.mrlaboratories.com">www.mrlaboratories.com</a> by Friday.

<p>Gymnastics was fun this evening; I did some roundoff and super tall back flips with good height and all that good stuff. Yay!

<p>I bounced on the trampoline and kinda scraped my neck vertebrae doing 15 front flips in a row, landing on my back each time.
