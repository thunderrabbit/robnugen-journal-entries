<p>Wow! It snowed a bit las night! Only a tiny sprinkle, but enough to dust the tops of the cars. The creek won't be frozen over clear now I bet.

<p>Jen and I went down to the creek and slid around on the dusty ice. We cracked it in several places, but didn't get wet.  So silent and peaceful in the woods; I meditated to make myself lighter so as to not crack the ice, and then heavier to make it crack. It kinda worked.

<p>Got back inside and Meagan called, "there's going to be 10 or 12 inches of snow today!"  Wow! I talked to her a bit and I'm pretty excited about seeing snow.

<p>Now it's 11:17am and I'm caught up. Tonight we go to see Blue Man Group in Boston. We're making contingency plans in case we get stranded overnight by the snow there!
