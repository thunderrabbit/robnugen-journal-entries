<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p>Pete just farted, and describes the flavor as awesome. The ride up with Fred was fun - oh we're in Slidell, Louisiana for our aunt Jean's funeral. We're puttin' the fun back in funeral. We're talking roller coaster stories now.

<p>It's good to catch up with Pete every once in a while.

<p><pre>[ed. note: please understand that we all love Jean so
very much and would never wish her harm or ill will of any sort.
I believe she is wonderfully happy being free from cancer and 
free from the world; I'm joyful for her new experiences.]</pre>

<p>I drove most of the way from Houston and we stopped in Beaumont to get sweatshirt and sweatpants for me since it was cold in Fred's convertible. Ate at Wendy's and kept driving. I drove like 4 or 5 hours and then slept a lot as Fred drove. He had 1 wrong turn, but got us to the house no sweat.

<p>I'm contemplating death and the death process. Is Jean watching? Is she bored? How long will she hang around near her body?  Hmmmm.

<p>Pete and Fred are upstairs getting a drink or something. I'm not sure why Fred and I think Pete is so funny, but he is.

<p>In the car driving now.

<p>I read from a book last night <em>How Good Do We Have To Be?</em> which suggested that the Adam and Eve story isn't about Adam and Eve failing, but about the distinction between humand and animals. Animals go by instinct while humans have <em>morals</em>; they have knowledge of Good and Evil.

<p>Tension is high in the family. Herb said to Jon, "is that the best you can wear to my wife's funeral?"
<br>In the car, Ma is snippyish and feels bad because we are late. "I just want to go faster; that's all."

<p>Fred and I are chillin' silently in the back. I am so thankful for my relationship with Manda where feelings are honored and welcomed, not bottled until they come out snippily.

<p>Service and funeral are over. At the service and eulogy part, I spoke before the group something like, "I remember Jean as so loving and wonderful and letting us be boys and do whatever boys do. We climbed up the huge tree and got muddy and she loved us no matter what. I have learned from her example and take this as a gift, teaching me how I might act toward other people in a loving manner."

<p>Funeral was in the rain - the fourth family funeral in a row in the rain: Monner, Grandad, Aunt Frances, Aunt Mercedes. I feel tired and a tad hungry.

<p>Slept then mingled at the main house at the reception type thing where we shared positive stories and stuff from like 6:30 to 10:30pm. We cousins helped clean up then I talked to Pete about life and stuff.

<p>We laughed sadly at Buddy's response when someone approached him consolingly at the funeral, "Buddy I'm real sorry 'bout your mom..." Buddy goes, "don't worry about it."

<p>We talked about plans and stuff. Pete hopes to have house and kids in 5 years. Wow.

<p>Going to bed now.
