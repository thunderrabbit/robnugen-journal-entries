<p>Yesterday Manda helped me clean my apartment before I hosted a Flashnet opportunity meeting yesterday evening.

<p>Mostly she just inspired me to clean more; cheerleading always helps me. I threw away a lot of crap, and created places for a lot of previously homeless stuff. There are no computers strewn across my living room floor, the kitchen table is visible, and all my dirty clothes are actually in the hamper. Wow.

<p>I had already washed the dishes and the cleaned bathroom.

<p>Guess what?  I'll be at <a href="http://ktru.org">KTRU</a> in less than 1 hour.  I'll be on air in about 1 hour!!

<p>Last night I chatted in <a href="http://wbs.net">WBS</a> in their Lounge C. Met Magic Fire, James something, ktemt, 1 Small Wonder, and ended up talking about Jesus and stuff. Discussion was kinda difficult for me since, by nature of a chat room, only short thoughts can be effectively spoken at a time.

<p>I just checked email, and have a few replies to probably delay until later.  See ya!
