Example Grant application for
YFUUD
Youth Funding for Unitarian Universalist Development

<b>Name of local, district, continental, intercontinental, or lunar project:</b>
MUUN (Mission for UU Nation) Camp: The first YRUU colony on the moon  
(aka Y.U.R. In Space!!)

<b>What is the expected total budget for your project?</b> $2.7 trillion

<b>What amount are you requesting from the YRUU Program Fund?</b> $2500

<b>If we cannot offer the full amount, would you want a partial amount?</b> Yes

<b>What is the minimum amount you would accept?</b> $0.50

<b>Who is the primary contact person(s) for your project?</b> Joe Kizonu

<b>What is the general intent of your project?</b> To make a big
camp on the moon allowing youth from all over the planet to have
a "get-away" spot for chilling. This will encourage group
cooperation between future moon inhabitants. For the longer term,
we hope to incorporate MUUN Camp as a city and later as a nation.

<b>Who will your project serve?</b>  Youth who wanted to be
astronauts as children but were laughed at.  Also will serve
youth who just want to live on the moon

<b>When and how do you plan to evaluate the progress of your project?</b>

At the end of MUUN Camp, we'll ask each camper to return an evaluation.  
Within a week after the camp, MUUN Camp Council will meet to review the 
evaluations from the campers and decide where we need to improve.   We expect 
to begin proceedings for incorporating as a city by mid 2000 and to secede by 
late 2001.

<b>Please include a process by which YFUUD will be able to analyze the progress 
of your project.</b>
A post-camp evaluation report including total project costs will be submitted to 
YFUUD within a month after the first MUUN Camp ends.
Given this report, 
YFUUD will know we used the money and that everyone had a great time.

<b>Has this project been done by you or your group in the past?</b> No

<b>If so, from where did you get your funding?</b> N/A

<b>Will this be an ongoing event? (annual or otherwise?)</b>  
MUUN Camp will occur every six months

<b>If so, how will it be funded next time?</b>
Moon pies and astronaut ice cream sales at the camp will fund future start-up costs.
