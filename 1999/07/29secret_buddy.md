<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>
<p class=date>9:30am Thursday 29 July 1999</p>

<p>Last night we worked our asses off on our resolution. I was up until 6am this morning helping work on it. The youth did most of the work; I worked on writing an example grant application with Chris and we really had a great funny time. We wrote a grant to fund a UU colony on the moon.

<p>I slept through breakfast again. Here now before plenary Mandy is on a scavenger hunt for clues.  First clue was on her tablespace, leading her to a yellow plastic egg way up on a shelf thing which held a note: "Not on Ceiling, Wall, nor Floor, but on the perimeter of this room."

<p>She looked around the piano a bit and then went toward the windows, "it didn't say window, right?" When people asked, she was all happily, "my secret buddy is making me work!!"  This is great!

<p>I had a nice synchronicity this morning.  After having trouble getting my calling card to work in order to check my messages at home I ended up at a payphone in an obscure corner of the builing calling customer service of my calling card.  They weren't answering the phone so I mentally thought, "5 seconds and I'm hanging up." I gave them 10 seconds and hung up. At that moment, Mandy walked in. I was perfectly done with the phone and I got to watch her as she found her clues!  I love my perfectly synchronistic life!
