<p>For a while now, Wende's doorknob has been difficult to open.
I'm talking about the one on the front door of her apartment. Whether trying to get in or out of the apartment, the knob just doesn't want to turn!

<p>Last night, when it was time for me to go home, I couldn't get the door open.  Hmmm.

<p>Fortunately, Wende has tools, and I unscrewed the doorknob screws.  Got the inside doorknob off, and figured the rest would just open up, but no.  Fortunately, Wende has Craftsman screwdrivers, so no matter how hard I tried to force the latch open, the screwdriver did not break.  Unfortunately, it still wouldn't open.

<p>With a few quick bonks with a hammer, I was able to knock the outside doorknob out with a klunk on her porch.  Still couldn't get the latch open.  "What if we <em>had</em> to leave right now?" I thought.  "What if there were a fire?"

<p>Hmmmm.

<p>"What if I pop the pins out of the hinges?   <em>bang bang bang bang</em> on each pin and I got them out.  Using the hammer, I was able to pry the door off the hinges without damaging the wood too much.

<p>Yay!!

<p>Took the latch mechanism out of the doorknob and put the doorknobs back on, so now they turn, but don't actually turn anything.  Fortunately there is a dead bolt to lock the door.

<p>I Put the door back on the hinges and showed Wende what needs to be replaced on the door.  She'll do that in the morning.

<p>I just thought that was an interesting story!
