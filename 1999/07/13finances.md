##13 July 1999

<p>It's four months until my trip.  I'll be out of town two weeks of those four months, fortunately, all in one spot, pretty soon from now.  (end of July to 6 August)

<p>I need about 6000 dollars for the trip.  Plus Scuba Certification.  Am I worried?  A little.  Do I have a job?  Not right now.  How's business?  Okay, but not crazy cashflow.  

<p>Hmmmm.  I'd hate to take out a loan from my dad or a friend, and especially not from a credit card...   But I really really want to go.  

<p>I'm busy with a couple of different projects that are not currently bringing in any cash.   Smallest is KTRU, only 3 hours per week, but in the middle of Tuesday.  Then my roller coaster pictures that I'd like to enter into some art shows.  If I focus on that (pun intended) it shouldn't take too long to do.  But it will cost on the order of $100.  Then my roller coaster book, but I can put that on hold essentially.  And last is youth group stuff, which will take the two weeks.  After that I can focus on work work work.

<p>I invite the perfect job to come to me starting August 7th.
