<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>
<p class=date>2:20am Thursday ? July 1999</p>

<p>I'm here at Youth Council and we've been writing resolutions to define how activities are done or to create new processes or whatever..  I've been working on budget related things: how YRUU budget needs to grow in the future, and another on how YRUU will distribute money through grants to different local YRUU groups.  

<p>Those probably don't mean much to you, but suffice to say that the youth here now tonight are doing big stuff and working together to truly affect their world.

<p>Holy cow.  Now it's 5:30am, and we completed our resolution, grant application and an example grant application.  The example is funny!!!!  I think it's even funny enough to be funny tomorrow after we sleep.

<p>A man has just arrived to vacuum the floors and stuff.  It's late; going to bed soon, though I think I'll write about today.

<p>Today Wednesday, we had plenary and then lunch.  After lunch my stomach was feeling blucky so I slept through workshops.  After workshops was the Super Secret Activity, which we had no idea what to expect, but they said we should wear swimsuits.  Piled into vans and drove for about 20 minutes to a state park where we stopped at a lakefront beach thing.  Yay!!  Quickly we were all in the water, splashing around and whatever.  Bryan challenged me to a holding breath contest.  I beat him the first time and then I tried again to beat my own time.  To exceed my own time, I gently hyperventilated until my arms and legs were tingling nicely then went under water and gently allowed my thoughts float away. I kinda focused on the tingling and just floated.  I could hear the youth talking and when someone said something like, "oh my gosh," I held up my thumb, "I'm okay!"   I finally resurfaced after 2 minutes 35 seconds.  Nice.

<p>A bit shallower, some people had found that sitting gently in the water would result in minnows gently nibbling their skin.  Responses to this fact varied between, "let me try!" to "oh my gosh that's gross!"   I tried and <em>yow</em> a minnow nibbled my nipple!  Game over for me after that!

<p>Ate lunch then played frisbee in the water until time to leave.  Listened to Bryan's Southpark CD on the way back here to Graceland College.

<p>As people first started working on their resolutions tonight, I set up a cool treasure hunt for Mandy, my secret buddy.  It starts with a note at her seat that she'll hopefully find tomorrow morning, leads her through 2 notes, 1 person, 2 more notes, 2 people and the second (4th) person will have the gift, a picture of Mandy and Nora at Con Con last year!

<p>Worship tonight was great, starting in a circle singing in a room, to watching some youth dance, to all of us dancing outside under the full moon.  Nice.

<p>Finished the funny example grant application and will probably include it here.

<p>Good night (still have to walk back to my room and take my contacts out)  It's 6:00am.
