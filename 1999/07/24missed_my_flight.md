<p>Got to Dallas Love and ran, following the signs to American Airlines.  Walked down a tunnel thing, up a ramp thing, back down a thing and suddenly didn't see any more signs for American.  Crap.  Back up the thing and back down and asked someone.  Turns out I had been going the correct way in the first place.  This sure wasn't well marked.

<p>Around a corner, through a security gate, up a small escalator, finally to the American counter.  Presented my ticket, "I'm trying to get to Des Moines."

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry; you're at the wrong airport.  We only have flights to Austin."

<p>Fuck.

<p>I slumped.  Okay, where do I need to go?

<p>The guy was pretty pessimistic about me making the flight; I only had 30 minutes to get there.  But I had to go for it.  Back down the little escalator, where the security guys were all, "? huh ?" and I told them the situation.

<p>"You might be able to make it if you grab a cab," they offered, plus, "good luck!"

<p>Trudged back up the hill, down the hill and let me promise you my bags weighed a million pounds.  No wheels, no shoulder straps.

<p>Out toward Passenger Pick Up and found the cabs were not availble there, but somewhat further down the sidewalk.  A baggage handler offered to drive me there in his cart.  So very appreciative I was and tipped him a dollar once my bags were in the trunk of the cab.

<p>Told the cabbie my plight and he drove 75 or 80 miles per hour toward the other airport.

<p>Unfortunately I didn't know what gate, and my bags were inaccessible in the trunk. I considered calling American on the phone, but they hadn't been able to give me gate information previously, so I didn't try this time.  I knew the second flight to Des Moines left from Gate C 26; the guy at Dallas Love had told me that.  So I assumed Gate C for the earlier flight I was trying to catch.

<p>Tipped the cabbie 5 bucks for a total of $30.  Hauled my bags back out of the trunk, and hauled up to the monitors.  Found an American Airlines desk before I found a monitor.  Wrong terminal.  My flight was leaving in several minutes from gate A18.

<p>My shoulders and hands were killing me, but I ran, hoping to find someone driving an electric cart.  I couldn't run more than 50 yards, and had to settle for a fast walk.  Fortunately they had moving sidewalks which helped some, but my arms were still burning.  Finally I found an electric cart willing to go my direction.  He was on break eating fries and a shake, but said, "let's go."

<p>I had made it to A26 from C26 in DFW.  I'm not sure how far that is, but it's pretty far.  To A18 we drove, zipping around people and stuff.  Got to the gate.  Missed my flight.

<p>Now I really wanted to cry. Instead, I payed the electric cart guy 2 bucks and he drove me to gate C34, from which the later flight would leave.  I couldn't believe how far I had walked!  I confirmed the flight information and called the Youth Council emergency number to let them know.

<p>In review: verify flight information before leaving.

<p>That is how I missed my flight.
