<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>
<p class=date>early am Sunday 25 July 1999</p>

<p>Talked to Bryan last night joking lots about Southpark movie.  He knows lots of the songs from the soundtrack and lots of lines from the movie. "Mom, there's someone at the door.  Mom!  I said there's someone at the door!  Hey, I can't see the TV!!"

<p>Duncan came in a bragged that his group had kidnapped 3 of the 6 touch group mascots, different plastic dinosaurs.  He vowed to have all of them by the end of the week.

<p>I was a tad nervous coming into breakfast this morning; I hadn't been part of any of the opening circles or whatever last night, so I'd be coming into the group essentially cold.  Of course it was no problem though; I just got in my "HI" mood and bounced into breakfast. 

<p>I'm learning names of the youth pretty quickly.

<p>First day of plenary is over and I'm inspired.  We talked about a vision for an ultimate YRUU, including Intercontinental Conference, and I later joined a working group that began a resolution on Outreach.  We sketched out a technique by which we could link up UU pen pals in various countries.

<p>Played dry fish hand fwapping game at our touch group meeting and that was fun.  Later a game of Fruit was suggested.

<blockquote>
<p>Fruit:

<p>Arrange a group of people in a circle.  Each person thinks of a unique name of a fruit -- apple, banana, orange, grape, etc.

<p>One person is chosen to be It, who stands in the center of the circle.  One person in the circle begins by saying their fruit name "loves" another person's fruit name.  It tries to tag the second person before they can say their fruit name "loves" another person's fruit name.

<p>"Apple loves grape"
<br>"grape loves strawberry"
<br>"strawberry loves banana"
<br>"Banana loves um, ..."  and Banana is tagged before finishing the sentence so Banana takes It's place, and It takes Banana's place and begins a new round using It's original fruit name.

<p>(note on grammar: In the preceding paragraph I used "It's" to mean the possessive form of It.  I recognize the correct possessive form of "it" is "its."  I added the apostrophe because I used "It" as a proper noun.)
</blockquote>

<p>We decided to play this game, but couldn't decide what version to play.  Fruit, Elements, or Animals, so we combined all three, plus added a rule that people could make up their own elements.

<p>"Apple love Phosphorous"
<br>"Phosphorous loves Sexium"
<br>"Sexium loves Kangaroo"
<br>"Kangaroo loves Whos-your-daddium"
<br>"Whos-your-daddium loves Swisherbeast"
<br>"Swisherbeast loves Kumquat"
<br>.....

<p>So much more funny!

<p>We played Capture The Flag with waterlogged squishy foam balls to tag people and I ended up in jail pretty quickly in the game.  Big fun with lots of good natured cheating and no real winner declared.  We mostly ran around trying to get people wet.

<p>Budget discussion in the evening plenary session resulted in Youth Council voting No to the adult-suggested budget for YRUU.  Normally Youth Council does a "rubberstamp" yes to whatever is suggested.  This is the first time in 17 years that this budget has been rejected.  A working group will be created to clearly state our reasons for rejecting it and the amounts we request.

<p>Yay!  Go Youth Council!

<p>12:45am Monday 26 July 1999

<p>Worship tonight was great and experimental.  Outside in a circle chanting quietly slowly turned to singing, clapping, beatboxing crazy fun!  Total love, total wow, total acceptance of all forms of performance.  Nice.

<p>We had placed sleeping bags on the ground and mine ended up with a significant amount of sap on it. Sticky.

<p>I used Dr Bronner's to allow the sap out.

<p>1:53 am.  Talked with Tera my wonderful advisor friend who is following her heart and dream to California.  I'm envious and inspired by her vision.  She told me about some paid advisor positions that are now or are becoming available.  Awesome!

<p>She also invited me to Winter Camp in her new California district!
