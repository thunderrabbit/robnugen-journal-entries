<p>What a great feeling!!!  The YFUUD resolution on which I spent many hours helping the youth write, passed unanimously!!!!  Thrilling!  Incerdible!!  Great work!!

<p>We've been in plenary for hours now.  After an initial debate took way too long, the rest are going well and smoothly.  I power napped for a moment once in the break-out room next to plenary hall.  Zonked out in kneeling position with my forehead on the ground for about 5 minutes.  Much better!
