<p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>
<br>"Feast or Famine"

<p>This entry is ramblesome; read it only if you're entirely interested.

<p><ol>

<p><li>I've heard many times that insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  Some parts of my life are insane in this manner; others are not.</li>

<p><li>I was working for a little at a company that shall remain nameless (have I already told this story?)  I think I have.  Anyway, they were inventorying their stuff for Y2K compliance, I hated the work, so I quit after only 3 days.</li>

<p><li>quit?  Yeah - I quit in order to stop the insanity.</li>

<p><li>So what do I plan to do for dollars for Australia?  Hmm.  Well, I've got a lot of pictures of roller coasters that I think are pretty good.  I'm going to enter some into a local art show around the end of the month; we'll see how that goes.</li>

<p>This is Step 1 of doing something different in my life.

<p><li>Step 0 was working at KTRU; that has totally brought some fun new experiences and friends into my life!</li>

<p><li>Step 2 is actually like step 1.5: work more on website design.  I've got 3 accounts kinda on hold.  One while I figure out how to get the Perl cgi shopping cart to work, the other 2 while the customers get their ISPs set up for shopping cart use.  

<p>Actually I can help them make that process go faster.</li>

<p><li>And lastly; somewhere in all these past 2 weeks I am certain I'd have more journal entries on my website if I had a laptop computer handy.  I could just type type type while on the plane, or in the car or chillin' in the hotel or by the pool....  I am not totally sickly attached to my computer, but I just really enjoy having my journal entries online.

<p>I can't explain it.</li>

<p><li>So I'm in the market for a Dell P133 laptop.  I choose Dell because I've heard they can run linux quite nicely.  Compaq apparently does not.</li>
