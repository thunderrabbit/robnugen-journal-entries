<p class=date>7:45pm Monday 26 July 1999</p>

<p>At dinner I tried to eat 6 crackers in under 1 minute.  I was unable, but it was funny trying.  No others were able either.

<p>After dinner we played Egyptian Rat Screw (a card game requiring fast reflexes) after check-in at touch group.  I found out that our touchgroup mascot (a plastic triceratops) had been hidden in the ceiling in Building A (my building) after the group had snuck out the fire escape from the kitchen of Building B (where our touch group met).

<p>Workshops next.

<p><hr>

<p>Wow.  Those weren't workshops, but Working Groups!  I had chosen LRY Grants thinking I'll learn how to apply for grants, but it turns out that we define how people can apply for grants to fund new YRUU projects! We brainstormed lots and will continue our work over lunch tomorrow. We began designing a subcommittee of Youth Council that will look over the applications each year and decide which ones to approve. A huge amount of thought has gone into just this process of developing the group, making sure all parties are equally represented and that no individual will have vested interest in a particular grant being reviewed.

<p>I'm really proud of these youth!

<p>During worship we sang a chant: "come and be one, become one, be one be," over and over.  Duncan sang something like "Come Obi Wan, become one with Ghandi" or something.  Pretty funny though not particularly worshipful maybe.  The version I made up in my head but did not sing was worse though: "run Bambi run, I'm gonna shoot your mommy."

<p>Sometimes I don't know why I think of these things.

<p>After the worship was finished, we sang Madonna's "Like a Prayer" with great enthusiasm!

<p>I've been tired today; I'm going to bed.

<p><hr>

<p>Nope not to bed.  I went downstairs after the entry to say goodnight, and the response was, "let's play Silent Football!"  They even asked me to be dictator, so it will be a Southwest District Rules version of the game.

<p>2am  Fun game hopelessly crazy; 20 or more people.  Chris forfeited the game trying to form a coup to overthrow the dictator. His penance is that he has to use his body to form the digits of numbers in his YRUU budget report to plenary.

<p>Eroca aquired the name "Ms Hairball Farm Mistress" or something and Austin ended up being called "Orangutang Muppet" for his boistrous laughter in response to Eroca's farm-animal-sounding laughter.  Super funny game!
