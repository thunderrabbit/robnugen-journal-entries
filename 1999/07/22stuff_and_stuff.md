<p class=date>22 July 1999</p>

<p>I entered 3 pictures into The Big Show, an annual art show here in Houston.  I don't know if they have been accepted yet; I'll find out by Friday.

<p>On this coming Saturday, I'm going out of town for 2 weeks.  Both weeks will be in Iowa for <a href="http://www.yruu.org">YRUU</a> stuff.  First week is for Youth Council, like the US Senate, except for YRUU.  Second week is for Con Con, a week long conference for youth, same as Con Con last year, except in Iowa.  (it moves each year)

<p>Over the past couple of days, I've been working on a project for another art show... it's seemed like a project:  I'm having slides developed out of prints that I've already taken.  The slides are needed to enter this next art show, and are due on August 4.  A quick look at my calendar and I realize I am quickly running out of time, since I'll be out of town past August 4th starting in 2 days.  Yikes!   

<p>Special thanks to Laura and the crew at <a href="http://www.wolfcamera.com">Wolf Camera</a> for their help.

<p>Speaking more about pictures, my friend Jennifer has offered to scan some pictures for me since I obviously haven't in a while.  I wasn't able to get my scanner to work on my Windows machine in a while, and haven't found linux drivers for the scanner.   If you know where I can get linux drivers for a Microtek ScanMaker E3 Plus, please <a href="mailto:robnugen@flash.net">let me know!</a>

<p>Speaking of linux, I met a dude named Jeffrey yesterday who also has linux on his PC, and even has a 50 megabit connection to the internet. Whoah!!  I met him yesterday at the laundry mat and it turns out we both know Cathy Crawford, an independent Flashnet representative like me!

<p>Speaking of Flashnet, I have been handing out way more business cards lately than before (previously I'd been handing out almost none) and surprise my sales appear to be going up!  I even gave my card to some cops downtown while I was skating!

<p>Speaking of skating, I found a group who skates consistently twice a week!  Like 15 or 20 miles per night!  Oh so so so exciting and they actually meet only 2 blocks from my apartment, so I can just skate over and join them.  Truue!!!!!

<p>Speaking of truue, today I'll be at KTRU from 1-4, covering Robert's shift.  Right now I'm meeting Robin for lunch and then KTRU then pictures to Jennifer to scan, then Flashnet meeting tonight.  Big fun all day!

<p>Oh, more about KTRU..  when I was there on Tuesday, near the end of my shift, kT came to see me!  She's one of my local youth.  She was all silly smiley and announced, "I've got worms!"  referring, of course to the gummy worms she had as a snack.  We laughed and ate worms and played "The Bumble Bee Tuna Song"  Big fun.  Yay!

<p>ps: I just got an <a href="/web_stuff/funny_classics/destroy_earth.html">article</a> that I think makes an interesting statement on our state of technology.
