<p class=date>Thursday 15 July 1999</p>

<p>Today Wende and I did lots of errands together in the morning - I mowed the lawn while she was sleepin', then we went to Ikea (bought picture frames for some of my roller coaster pics to enter them into an art show), and then to see Maggie, then deposited some money in my brokerage account to cover the 10 Compaq shares I bought yesterday, then to KTRU where I was on the air from 1pm to 4pm.

<p>Now Wende and I are going to Dallas for a Flash Mania, a FlashNet convention showing off all the latest and greatest FlashNet goodies that we can sell.

<p>But the reason I'm writing is that I recognize I'll be in the car for 4 hours there and back.  Assuming we split the driving, I'll have 4 hours total of car riding time.  (Actually Wende's truck, not a car)  That means (if my mood is anything like when I went to New Orleans recently) that I will want to write.  Write write write write.  And I haven't yet got a laptop.

<p>Yeah yeah I can use the old fashioned paper and pen technique, but the handwriting is sloppier, and I can't easily put it online!  So if you have an old laptop to donate to me, I'd love to take it off your hands.

<p>Have a great weekend and stuff!
