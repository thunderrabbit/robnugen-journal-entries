<p>Slept through breakfast and therefore missed the advisor meeting at 7:45am.  Oops.  I needed the sleep though.  Plenary was cool this morning; the at-larges (there are 4 youth at-large positions: 1 each to represent junior high, after high school (ages 19-20), social action, and Canada.  There are seven adult-at-large positions, of which I am one.) all introduced themselves and how they could be best used as resources. After the obvious youth related stuff, I told them computers and roller coasters.

<p>During lunch our grant application working group met.  We have named ourselves YFUUD (pronouced "why food" (when we reach concensus we yell, "why food... because!")), which stands for Youth Funding for UU Development.

<p>Worship was creative and cool.  We decorated little medicine pouches.  I made a bead necklace (big colorful beads, short string so it looks kinda like a Marge Simpson necklace) for my secret buddy Mandy. I've been sending her notes and hugs throughout the day.

<p>Tonight is Blind Date Dance night.  We each got slips of paper saying where to meet our date, but no name was given.  To dress up for the date, I'm wearing Fricke Fiesta scrubs, tie dyed Biff's Wonderful Clam Dip shirt and my new hat.

<p>Dance was fun, Sarah Pappas as my "date".  We played coy and it was funny funny, "um, what do you want to do?  I dunno what do you want to do?"  We danced all crazy and yeah.  DJ played White Rabbit by Airplane Crashers for me and closed with Simpsons opening sequence.  Funny.  Good night.
