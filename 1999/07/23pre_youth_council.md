<p class=date>8:22pm Friday 23 July 1999</p>

<p>In 12 hours I leave for 2 weeks in Iowa.  I haven't packed yet.  The first week I'll be an adult-at-large on Youth Council, and the second week I'll be an advisor at Con Con.  Each of these events are youth empowering, youth organized, youth everything, and I'm proud to be a part of the wonderfulness.

<p>I do not have a laptop yet (haven't had the proper cashflow for one) so I may write a mega entry at the end of it all, but maybe will figure out a way to write while I'm there.

<p>My pictures were not selected for show in The Big Show at Lawndale Art Center.  I picked them up today and I'll put them on my wall here in my apartment where they are loved and appreciated!

<p>I'll be sending 10 slides out to another art show thing in San Antonio; I'll let you know how that goes.

<p>So my big overall thought these days is something like, "how are you going to pay for Australia?"  This question is subtitled "are the prices my travel agent quoted still available?"

<p>To this end, I think I am ready to fully kick into gear my Flashnet sales and may look for a job as soon as I get back from Iowa.  Weird thing is that after Flashmania in Dallas, I kicked booty talking up Flashnet and now I'm out of town for two weeks so I can't really do it.  I hope and expect my excitement will still be up when I get back.

<p>Now i am packed.  It's 11:50pm.  Even went with Wende to Target to get little gifts for our Secret Buddies.  :-)   I got a small trout shaped flashlight ("it's not a flashlight; it's a fishlight!"  "it's so dark in here!" - "don't worry, I have my fish!")  Also grabbed a glostick, and something else but I forgot what.

<p>I got a dark green Gilligan hat for myself.  I like it.

<p>So there you go. I'll be gone for two weeks and I'll have a super incredible time.  No telling what or how much I'll write when I get back; I know how my track record has been.. 

<p>Have a great two weeks yourself!!

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
