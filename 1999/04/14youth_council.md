ROB!!!!!!

YOU'RE ON YOUTH COUNCIL!!!!

WHOOPPIEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!

YOU DID IT!!! :) :) :) :) :)


There. I'm so excited for you. it will be an amazing, affirming,
life-changing experience.

Concon isnt' a requirement, but it's so easy to go since your travel to
YC is covered by the youth office, and con con will be just an hour or
so away. You still have to sign up as normal, and unfortunately you
still have to pay.

we're going to have so much fun. are you going to GA?

well, just so you know, maia was chosen as continental social action
coor., and melissa was chosen for a second term of jr. high age
range rep.

go SWD!!!

love, tera
