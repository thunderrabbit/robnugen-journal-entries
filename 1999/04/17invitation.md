##17 April 1999

<p>Jason called this morning.  He was all, "Rob, wanna go to Australia with me for four months?"

<p><em>whoah!</em> said my brain.  "Whoah.  Four months?"

<p>"Yeah.  My mom said that I should travel before I try to do anything else so I told her 'okay; me and Rob are going to Australia.'"

<p>"Wow. That would be totally great, and I can see the value in it. I totally encourage you to do it.  I just couldn't take that much time off."

<p>"That's cool.  I just chose you because you're the only person who's adult enough to be able to go, but still cool enough not to have a job to keep you here.  Plus you're like the only person I know who I wouldn't want to kill after being with you for more than 2 days straight."

<p>Wow.  "Wow. I really appreciate that.  But I just couldn't do it..."

<p>All day the conversation stuck in my mind. While en route to Dallas (to visit my brother and Six Flags over Texas) I had time to meditate on it.

<p>Why not go to Australia?  I dunno.
<br>Why not go for a shorter time?  I dunno.
<br>When could you go?  After San Antonio Rally, before New Years.
<br>So that's all of November and December.  yup.
<br>Well?

<p>So I called Jason from the road and left a message.  "Yo Jason.  I've been thinking a lot about this crazy Australia thing.  I'll go with you for a month, and if you want to stay longer, you certainly can."

<p>Jason called back later and was all, "yeah. I knew you'd do it."
