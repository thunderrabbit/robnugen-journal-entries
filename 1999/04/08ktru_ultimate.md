<p class=date>7:12pm Thursday 8 April 1999</p>

<p>Aw man, first, super duper special thanks to Wende for reminding me last night that today is Thursday and I was supposed to work at KTRU!!!!  I had totally forgotten it, and she mentioned it offhandedly (whatever that is supposed to mean) and I was like, "!!!!!!!!!"

<p>Wende and I had just eaten at Dude and Veronica's house and it was gettin' late. We still had to go to Sterling McCall to get Scott after he had his timing belt and water pump replaced.

<p>See, the water pump failed, causing the timing belt to break, so they didn't warranty anything. I wasn't super joyful, but thankful that now I have 1 year or 12000 miles warranty on my timing belt *and* my water pump!  $590 was the price they quoted me.

<p>We got there at like 11:30pm and it was only $540. Yay. Drove home and finished reviewing a CD that I have had for a while. Couldn't print my review since my printer was out of ink. D'oh! (No, I wasn't going to hand write the review after typing it so neatly).  Went to bed at like 1am.

<p>I had napped earlier in the day, so 3:20 am didn't come tooo early. I got up, showered (first time I've showered before KTRU) drove in.  Matt was there on the 1-3am shift so I got into the building no problem.

<p>He was playing a spoken thing--this dude was eloquently describing just how completely depressed he was and how he masochistically kept himself alive as punishment. The simple act of being alive felt difficult for this man.  The track was like 15 or 30 minutes long of depressed depression. It ended delightfully close to 4am.  I played "All I Want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth" to lighten the mood.

<p>I played a pretty great variety.  One 30 minute set had like Tejano, reggae, rock, jazz, ska, hardcore rap, and a 30 second segment of Neil Armstrong first stepping onto the moon all mixed in.

<p>Got a call like at 6:15 or so. It was the next DJ calling in sick, inviting me to simply turn off the station at 7am.  Hmmmm.

<p>I told him I would probably hang out for a bit longer, maybe try to call some other DJs to get someone in.  He said thanks, but that it wasn't that big of a deal to turn the station off.

<p>Then I got a call around 6:50 am.  It was Jen in New Hampshire!! Woah!  She got RealAudio and was listening to me on the web! That is so super cool. Wow. I was already having fun and now I felt inspired to just keep on spinning records. I went until 9am when the next next DJ arrived.

<p>Went home, ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and went to bed for about 1.5 hours. 

<p>Had dreams of KTRU, taking requests and playing music, and not having the music that was requested. Not really *bad* not having the music, just *oh well* not having it.

<p>Woke up, wrote a long letter for some youth stuff, and made travel plans to visit Great America in early May.

<p>Travel-plan-making was great.  I have a guest pass on America West Airlines, so I called them, but they didn't have round trip service to the city I wanted to visit (Chicago).  I called Southwest, for which I have a $200+ voucher, but they don't fly to O'Hare.  Hmmm.  So I called Jayne, my favorite bestest travel agent (281-359-1010) and she was all, "you wanna go to O'Hare?  You've got $290 flight credit with Continental with us."  

<p>WHOAH!!  Sign me up!   I was so super duper thankful that she remembered (maybe their computers remembered, but who cares) and wow.  Yes oh yes, and the ticket will only cost like $210 of that so I'll have like $80 left. Awesome.  Thank you Jayne; thank you Angels.

<p>Then Dude and I went to play frisbee.  My disc was in Wende's truck so he bought an ultimate disc and we went to Rice to play. The wind was super breezy and shifty and not quite gusty, making play challenging.

<p>I did well for not having practiced much and Dude got some great throws fairly consistently.  I noticed he did better when he didn't really try or concentrate, but just let it happen.

<p>A team was in an adjacent field so we went and watched/talked with them. Once their scrimmage was over, I joined a 3 on 3 man quick game.

<p>OH MY GOODNESS I was so winded. Stomach in a knot, phlegm in throat, tired, panting, hot! Wow. I will do that more often to keep in better shape.

<p>I got some pretty good throws and catches in, but didn't play as great as I have in the past. I haven't practiced in quite a while. I enjoyed the exertion.

<p>Now Dude and I are going to work on website stuff.
