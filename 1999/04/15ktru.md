<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>
<p class=date>Thursday 15 April 1999</p>

<p>Wednesday Night dinner was at Chuck E. Cheese last night. We were there until like 10pm.  I played a race driving game against Jon several times in a row; he beat me about 60 percent of the time.  I didn't crawl in the ball crawl.

<p>It was like 10pm ish by the time we left. I had to go to bed before KTRU.  Woke up and called KTRU at 1am to make sure Matt was there to let me in at 4am.  He was.  Actually, Allison answered the phone, which was unexpected; she was up there working on a paper.

<p>Woke up 3:30 and drove to the station; Allison was still there!!!  She left, then Matt turned the station over to me at 4am.  I played a pretty good variety and had fun, but only had 1 caller all night!  Allison stepped back in for a brief second like around 4:30am.

<p>A tad after 6:30 (after I knew Wende had to be awake), I played "She Drives Me Crazy" from <em>Kermit Unpigged</em> CD.  It was Kermit and Miss Piggy on vocals.

<p>At exactly 6:56am I started the wack hidden track on the CD <em>Girl Crushes Boy</em> by Smile.  It is 4 minutes long and is samples from a telephone conversation where a girl totally has a crush on some guy.

<p>At the very end he's all, "anywhere you want, anytime between 6 and 6:30."

<p>She's all, "okay, 6:30 in your pants, your place."

<p>He goes, "really?  okay.  Um, how about seven?" and the track ends.

<p>I paused for a second, "...  it's seven o'clock. . . . K-T-R-U Houston"

<p>I went on to name all the songs I had just played, and announced that everyone had 17 hours to turn in their taxes.

<p>I had told 3 people to be sure to listen right before 7am for that; I've been wanting to do it for about a month or so, but just got the CD on Saturday.

<p>So it was 7am, and Mark wasn't there yet.  Hmmmm.

<p>I cued up a Texas blues song or something and the phone rang (my second call of the night). I hoped it was Mark.  It was Jonathon.  He's the DJ who has the Wednesday 4-7am shift (He's new like me).  I had invited him to listen to my 7am entertainment.  He thought it sounded great and we talked a bit, but I told him I had to go and try to find Mark.

<p>I put on one of my fav CDs called <em>Frankenstein Symphony</em> by Francis Dhomont.  The tracks are all just sounds with no beat - they are like subtle movie soundtrack noises for a horror flick.  But not that scary.

<p>I called Mark's number, and it rang like 10 times.  I was just about to hang up when his room mate answered.

<p>"Is Mark there?"

<p>"Let me go see.."   [pause]  "he's sleepin'; should I wake him up?"

<p>"Yeah totally wake his ass up."

<p>[pause]

<p>"He said he'll be right there??"  Room mate was intrigued that Mark knew what the call was about.

<p>"Cool.  How long?"

<p>[pause] "fifteen or twenty minutes."

<p>"cool.  thanks.  bye."

<p>So I just chilled and listened to Frankenstein Symphony.  The track was about 1/2 over with 8 minutes left when I thought, "boring."

<p>So I grabbed an ambient techno CD called "Astral Pilot", which just happened to have an 11 minute track of heavy ambient beats.  Awesome.

<p>I cued up the CD and slowly faded the beats of Astral Pilot on top of Frankenstein Symphony, faded FS out, back in, AP out, back in, crazy just fade in out in out each different one, until FS got a tad interesting and I faded out Astral Pilot and paused the CD.

<p>FS got dull again and I faded in the beats of AP, then switched them in and out every 4 beats.  So FS was in background and the beats would go [thump] [thump] [thump] [thump] (pause) (pause) (pause) (pause)
<br>[thump] [thump] [thump] [thump] (pause) (pause) (pause) (pause)
<br>[thump] [thump] [thump] [thump] (pause) (pause) (pause) (pause)
<br>[thump] [thump] [thump] [thump] (pause) (pause) (pause) (pause)
<br>[thump] [thump] [thump] [thump] (pause) (pause) (pause) (pause)

<p>And then FS got interesting again and I faded out the beats for a bit and then back in and I got a phone call.  (My third one of the night).

<p>It was a woman's voice, "What song have you been playing?"

<p>Heh.  "Well, actually I've been mixing two songs.  One is <em>Frankenstein Symphony</em> by Francis Dhomont, and the other is 'Astral Pilot'"

<p>"Oh."  She almost sounded disappointed, or maybe like, "ah that explains it."

<p>"Can you hear them right now?" I asked.

<p>"Yes."

<p>"Okay," I faded down Frankenstein Symphony, "this is Astral Pilot."  I faded FS back in.  "And this," I faded down AP, "is Frankenstein Symphony."

<p>"Hmm."

<p>"How's <em>that</em> for catering to a listener?"

<p>"Pretty good."

<p>"Which one do you like better?"

<p>"I like the Frankenstein Symphony better."

<p>"Cool.  I put that one on for you."

<p>The track was just ending, so I bumped Frankenstein Symphony back to track 3, my favorite of the four on the CD.  Just then Mark walked in.

<p>"Sorry I'm late."

<p>"No sweat."  I told him what I had just been mixing and he laughed.  I asked him to let this one song continue for my unnamed listener and he said no problem.

<p>Signed off the station log and went home.
