<p class=date>1:30am Wednesday 28 april 1999</p>

<p>This week Jen is in town from New Hampshire!  This is part two of the climate exchange program, where I went to NH in February to experience something a tad cold, and she's here in Houston now to experience something a tad warm.  She's also going to apply for grad school at Rice.

<p>We've been happily busy.  On Monday I substituted for Aline on KTRU from 11am to 1pm, and Jen helped choose music and helped pronounce some of the jazz artists' names.  She even added some cool facts about the artists and music that I would never have known!

<p>Today we went to my dad's house north of Tomball, and said HI and hung out (I read Sunday comics) and went to brunch.  Then we cruised back to my dad's and Jen and I read from WIRED magazine the article "83 reasons why Bill Gates can be beat" or something.

<p>Then back to my part of town and we watched <em>Never Been Kissed</em>.  Drew Barrymore is totally totally cute. 

<p>Jen is spending the night at Wende's tonight.  I've been working on website stuff with Dude.

<p>Tomorrow:
<ul>
<li>10am: go get Jen, eat breakfast
<li>11am: hour or so at Mad Potter and paint pottery and work on my plate.
<li>1pm: Take Jen to get shoulder massage at whole foods before her flute performance on Friday.
<li>4pm: Me and Jen go to Rice for an economics experiment thing
<li>7pm: Mad Potter with youth group.  They'll paint 4x4 inch tiles that we will place in a newly poured sidewalk on May 2nd at the Children's Museum! Should be super fun.
<li>9pm: Rob and Jen at Rice and I'll read some chapters of <a href="../../thepin/index.html">my novel</a> to a small informal audience.  This will not be broadcast live, but will be recorded and may be broadcast later.
<li>4am - 7am Thursday  Rob and Jen on KTRU!!
</ul>
