<p class=date>3:39am Friday 9 April 1999</p>

<p>I've been up for 24 hours now, starting with KTRU, ultimate, computer work, dinner with Wende, and now more computer work and Dude and I have just finished phase one of www.frontofficeautomation.com.  Actually there are two versions different only in the motif of graphics used in each version.

<p>We'll talk to Mike and see which one he likes better.

<p>This weekend KTRU has a big meeting on Friday (changing of leadership), and KTRU is hosting their 8th Annual Outdoor show from noon till 8pm on Saturday.

<p>Also this weekend, the Southwest District is having their Spring Conference in the woodlands, at my old church, about 1 hour north of here.  I want greatly to fully attend all these events.  We'll see how it goes.

<p>KTRU meeting starts in 8 hours.
