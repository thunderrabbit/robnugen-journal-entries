<p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>

<p><ol>

<p><li>Dude and I worked for 7 days pulling data and voice cable into a new construction site.  It was actually an old warehouse being remodeled on the inside to be office space.

<p>We got this job after working on a couple of small cable jobs for a different company; we were all, "yeah we pulled some cable.." and the guy goes, "really?  that's what we do all the time; wanna help us?"

<p>We were paid a delightful $25 per cable (actually we haven't been paid yet) and we did a super clean great job on all 182 cables.  Nice.</li>

<p><li>I bought stock in FlashNet soon after it hit the market.  It had jumped from $17 in the primary market to $39 in the secondary market; I bought it at like $43.  It immediately sank, then has come back up to that level now.</li>

<p><li>I intend to put $10,000 in stock by the end of this year.  I am thankful that money will come into my life as I need it.</li>

<p><li>KTRU has been great fun!  (Hey Bryn and Eryn!!!) I found the North American Frog CD!  I knew it should have been filed under Various Artists (various frogs), but I looked under "North American", "Frogs", "Various Frogs"..  I never found it. It's under "Sounds of North American Frogs"  
Yay!  I've played some from that CD twice now.

<p>I feel way more comfy on the mic than when I first started, and I've experimented with various sounds and stuff.

<p>The coolest mix I've done is play Miranda July's "Medical Wonder" over Francis Dhomont's _Frankenstein Symphony_.  That probably means nothing to you...
<br>Basically "Medical Wonder" is a dramatic story told from the point of view of a researcher who has gone mad after an experiment.  _Frankenstein Symphony_ is a CD of crazy sounds chopped up from various symphonies.  I combined the two, using Dhomont to amplify the drama in "Medical Wonder."  I loved the result!

<p>I'm on air from 4-7am on Thursdays (CST)  <a href="https://www.ktru.org">https://www.ktru.org</a> to listen on the web!!
</li>

<p><li>I have made plans to go to Six Flags Great America on the weekend of May 7-9!!!!  I'm super totally excited about it!  I'll use my Southwest Airlines voucher to purchase the tickets (should still have some $$ left over) and attend the park FREE with my Six Flags Season Pass.  yay!!

<p>My friend Carina lives up like 20 minutes from the park, so she'll pick me up from the airport and stuff.  yay!!</li>

<p><li>Oh, this Six Flags excitement is part of writing my book, _Rob's Rollercoaster Roundup_, a big beautiful coffee table book of coasters and just riding them all around the country!  If you know any publishers who are looking for this project exactly, <a href="mailto:thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom">let me know!</a></li>

<p><li>Wende and Dude got me the best present in the world!!!  Vanity license plates (oh that sounds so egotistical) that say "MR LABS"  See? delightful advertising for <a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com">www.mrlaboratories.com</a>!  Also I have a "ktru" sticker on my car cut to bits to say "www. mrlaboratories .com"

<p>Chopping to bits and reassembling KTRU stickers is a common practice. The unaltered stickers say
<pre>
ktru 91.7fm
rice radio
</pre>
so it's easy to make them say "mice radio" or "rick rodeo" or "foam dice"  With a bit more effort, pretty much anything can be written, including
<pre>
www.
mrlaboratories
          .com
</pre>
with the "mrlaboratories" going up at an angle so it all fits nicely all on two lines.</li>

<p><li>I'm late for church.</li>
