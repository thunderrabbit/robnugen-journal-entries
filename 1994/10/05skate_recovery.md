<p>Instead of a wild and crazy skating adventure, I will describe
(briefly) the latest news on my recovery.  My head has stopped
hurting, my ear has stopped ringing, and I might have the tiniest bit
of my sense of smell back.  However, my back is still really hurt.  I
went to my chiropractor and she popped my back.  (they call it
"aligning."  I call it pain.)  But, in fact, after the pain, my back
did actually feel a little bit better.  A little bit.  I talked to her
(the doctor) at some length and she told me the following wonderful
news.  I will have a complete complete recovery.  I will be able to
play frisbee again.  I'll be able to skate again, and I'll be able to
do gymnastics again.  I was so very entirely pleased when she told me
that.  However, unfortunately, she estimated complete recovery will
take between 9 months to 2 years.  Sigh.  But I am highly pleased that
I will be better again.  So that's it.  Hopefully from here it's just
a continual, although slow, process to recovery.</p>

<p>Have fun
