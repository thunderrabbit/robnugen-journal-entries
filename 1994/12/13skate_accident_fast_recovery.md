<p class=date>13 December 1994<p>

<p>Since my accident, I have had an exceptional recovery.  I only have
a little bit of tense muscle type problem in my back.  I almost have
my entire sense of smell back.  I am ready to *skate*.  I went looking
for a helmet, but was unable to find one that seemed quite tough
enough for me.  One weird thing was that when I described my accident
to some guys at a bike shop, they were like, "oh, *you're* the one!
Wow.  You're the man.." Heh- I don't know if I want fame if it takes
such an accident.  So I'm quite ready to skate. I know I will before
the year comes to an end. Well, I *hope* I will. I need to get that
super cool helmet first.<p>
