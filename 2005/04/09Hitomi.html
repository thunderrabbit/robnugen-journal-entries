<p class=date>9:48am JST Saturday 09 April 2005</p><p>Today is the day Hitomi is flying to New York!  This morning she wrote:</p><p>‚X‚É¬“c‹ó`‚És‚©‚È‚¯‚ê‚Î‚È‚ç‚È‚©‚Á‚½B<br>‚X‚É‹N‚«‚½</p><p>I can't read three of these kanji ¬“c‹ó` (the second is ta) but Ican read the rest of the message.  She said she was supposed to leave¬“c‹ó` at 9am, but she <em>woke up</em> at 9am.</p><p>I'm so sympathetic and sending her waves of good energy to get herto the airport safely and on time.</p><p class=date>10:00am</p><p>Damn.  I looked it up: ¬“c‹ó` is Narita Airport.</p><p>I find myself wishing I had supported her by calling around 7am.</p><p class=date>11:13am</p><p>I've spoken with her; she's going to fly out around 4pm.  She seemsin good spirits about the whole thing and I may get to meet her inYokohama!  Eeeks!  210,000 yen for her to buy a new ticket.</p><p>- - - -</p><p>Turns out she took some sinus medicine after a few drinks; thatzonked her out so she didn't hear her alarm.  Nightmare!</p>
