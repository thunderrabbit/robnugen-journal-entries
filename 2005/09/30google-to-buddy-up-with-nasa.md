[Schmidt's Google To Buddy Up With NASA - Forbes.com](http://www.forbes.com/technology/ebusiness/2005/09/29/google-nasa-search-cx_cn_0929autofacescan01.html)

This one looks pretty damn cool.  

According to [another article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4292458.stm), Google will open up a million square feet worth of office space in NASA Ames research center.

My goodness it would be good to have a few hundred GOOG shares right about now.

Barring that, I look foward to seeing Google Mars and Google Moon.  I want to see how they represent the alien station on the far side of the moon.
