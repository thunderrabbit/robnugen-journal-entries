[Star Wars III](http://robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?type=all&date=2005/09/27#Star_Wars_III)



Nice movie.  I loved the monsters and lava and the final fight
scenes.  The classic scene of heros (fighting anti-heros) on a raft
about to go over the waterfall piqued my senses when that water was a
river of lava.  How incredible.





The transition of Anakin's body into a burned mess was quite
believable.  I can see why he would have risked attacking from the low
position, and how he fucked up doing it.  Lava burning off the suit
and not actually burning the entire body was definitely believable.
Very Jedi for Obi-wan to leave instead of kill his previous prey.





The transition from Darth Vader as burned mess to wearing a black
suit seemed a bit too fast.  But I enjoyed wearing the mask for a
second.  Red tints his vision forever after.  No wonder he is so
angry!





And man, when Darth Vader first breathed...  Woah.  I remember
that noise.





Not quite as amazing when he first spoke.  Not.... a believable
transition, I guess.  Too abrupt, maybe.





I (being a great movie director) would have had the newly costumed
Darth Vader say something like, "shit, I can't feel Padme's presence
anywhere," to explain why he might agree she was dead.  She could have
just died and he just come alive and it woulda been perfect.





Also, I was surprised at how quickly Anakin broke his allegiance
when Mace Windu was killed.  I don't remember the scene exactly, but
the switcharoo seemed pretty quick.





How did Darth Sidious plant a code 66 in all his fighters?  Were they his
army?  That set of scenes was fuckin' scary.  I was glad to have some
pre-knowledge of who must live.





I liked the explanation for why storm troopers are used in episode
IV.  Not that they didn't have the CGI technology in the 70s, er, the
future, but that Darth Sidious had all droids shut down.  But I don't
otherwise why he would do that.





If C-3P0's memory gets wiped, I don't get how he will recognize
R2D2 when they are reunited on Tatooine.  And why do they end up
there?  I may have missed that.





I liked the fight between Yoda and Darth Sidious.  It wasn't as surprising
as the one with Count Dooku (sp) in the previous movie, but still
cool.  I like how they didn't try to make it More Than the previous
fight.  They made it just the right amount of cool.  Oh, and when Yoda
walked into the room and those red cats tried to stop him but just
crumpled...  that was money.





In the final scene, good job on the image of Uncle Owen watching
two suns set.  Just like the first movie.  Uh, I mean the next
one.





Oh, and Leia really looked like Leia and Uncle Owen did too.
Great casting.  Not as difficult to find non-speaking actors, I
guess, but still cool.
