I just installed the Batavia 1.5 theme.  I didn't like the color, but I like the design, especially the little  squares around the top of the calendar.  Dude said it's easy enough to change the colors, so that's what I did.  It wasn't trivial; the feedback loop took a few steps, but I'm pretty happy with the colors now.
