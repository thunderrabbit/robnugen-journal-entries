I just installed wordpress from [wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org) at Dude's suggestion.  It looks pretty cool.  At first I was like, "ain't no way I'm gonna revamp all my journal shit, so I ain't installing fuckin' wordpress," but then I thought, "ain't no way I'm gonna revamp all my journal shit, but I could start a non-journal blog on my site, just to keep up with the times."
