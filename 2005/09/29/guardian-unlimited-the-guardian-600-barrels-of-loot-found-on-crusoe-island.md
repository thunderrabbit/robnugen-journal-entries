[Guardian | 600 barrels of loot found on Crusoe island](http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1578135,00.html)

Obviously the money belongs to Arturito.  Finders, keepers.  Too bad he's not sentient, yet.

What would a sentient robot do with $10B?

It sounds like too much money for it to be good news, ya know?    Papal rings???  Incan statues??

I seriously think it should be excavated by ARCHAEOLOGISTS, and super tight security around the whole thing.
