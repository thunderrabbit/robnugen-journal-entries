<p class="date">2:27pm IST Monday 31 October 2005</p>

<p>At this moment, we are in a taxi in Hwara, waiting for one more
person to join us for the trip to Qalandia.  Sarah, me, Jonas, David,
Chris, and Leena is waiting outside the taxi until we head out.</p>

<p>Things today:</p>

<pre>feeding apples to a horse
picking olives that were big and fat and plentiful
watching the ordinance explode, but not cause the grenade to blow
being herded behind the truck for the explosion
being told we could not watch the explosion
being told we could not record the event
being told we could put our  cameras on the front of the truck
</pre>

<p>Chris told us a cool story of his adventures in Cairo while he
learned Arabic for two months at a school.  I want to do that; no
more learning languages by teaching Japanese.  Just pay the $1000 for
tuition , housing and food and hook up the learnin'.</p>

<p>walked the long way to the grenade, perhaps because the soldiers
were on the settler road and would not approve of us crossing the
field.</p>

<p>discovered *CHOCOLATE* pudding, though a biit dry in the fridge!!  
I chowed a significant portion of it on my humus and couscous piita.
cous is a rude name for a woman's vulva in arabic</p>

<p>started an No English day with Chris and David, though we didn't
play for all that long.</p>

<p>We played the Jackie Purdy Game after picking olives and walking to
the grenade.</p>

<p>Really strange to have sun and sprinkles almost perfectly mixed</p>

<p class="date">2:38pm</p>

<p>We are at a flying checkpoint now, with a pretty long line of cars
(basically all taxis) behind it.</p>

<p class="date">2:51pm</p>

<p>I slept and feigned sleep and never showed my passport.  also did
not show it at Hwara, but just projected a sphere of love around me and
rolled (*) through.</p>

<p>(*) rolled = walked casually.</p>

<p>Back home to the Faisal where Francois is well loved.</p>
