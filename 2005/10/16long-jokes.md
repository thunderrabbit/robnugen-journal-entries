These are the long jokes I know.  They are more like stories with
silly punchlines.  I wrote the one about the kid who loves to do
dishes.







  1. How to catch a pink elephant


  2. Moe and Joe


  3. Kid who loved green golf balls


  4. Kid who loved clowns


  5. Magician and the captain's parrot


  6. Kid who loved to do dishes


  7. Ten little piggies


  8. Man in the black hat, white gloves, red cape, who killed my mom, my dad, seven brothers and seven sisters


  9. The perfect koosh


  10. Shaggy dog


  11. Woman who had a recurring dream
