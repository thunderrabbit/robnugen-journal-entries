<p>Yes!</p>

originally planned to do when coming over here.  A pretty quick taxi
ride from Nablus/Balata area, we arrived in Salem, a small blip of a
village with garbage in the street and rough rock buildings with few
accoutrements.</p>

<p>Through the village and turned right and avoided an earthen road
block by driving across a rough cracked dry red clay field with a
smoldering pile of rubbish in one corner.</p>

<p>We piled out and immediately came across two cow carcasses, that
seemed fairly intact except for the faces and tails.  I chose not to
get a picture of Francois with them; not so much because it didn't
seem right, but because I didn't want to infect him with carrion
cooties.</p>

<p>Shortly, we were met by a man with a yellow hat and headed across a
settler road (*) and met some people picking olives.  ((Hmmm..  I
realize now that I didn't get a photo of the overview;; olive tree
with tarps below them to catch the goodies))</p>

<p>(*) highway that only military and Jewish settlers can use.</p>

<p>Just as we arrived, a military jeep raced up and stopped on the
settler road near us, where two soldiers jumped out and ran over to
the field where our taxi had been, though he had driven away.</p>

<p>But then we heard what sounded a lot like a gunshot from that
direction, and resounding echo from the surrounding hills.  Woah.</p>

<p>We watched a bit longer, but that seemed to be the end of the
action, so we decided to get to work on the olives.</p>

<p>The training was pretty straightforward as given by Chris: "pick
everything and let it drop."  No concern over size nor ripeness, but
everything seemed approximately the same color, so...  I kicked off my
sandals (purchased in Viet Nam and well worn with love since then),
climbed a tree and started picking.</p>

<p>At first I would pick about 8 or 10 olives, and then toss them so
they would land neatly on the tarp.  Then I experimented with just
pluck-and-drop and those also landed on the tarp.  So from then on I
just plucked and dropped.  plucked and dropped.</p>

<p>Francois wasn't a big help, but I did pose him for a couple of
pictures.</p>

<p>Pick pick pick pick and lots of climbing.  I wanted everyone to see
and be amazed with my climbing skillz: barefoot and balancing in the
wind with both hands focused on plucking and dropping.</p>

<p>I was in the tree with Jonas at first, and since it was a
relatively big tree, we were there for a while.  At one point, he said
he couldn't get any more in a particular section, and I was
like, <em>yes</em> cause that's exactly what I wanted to hear.  Just
so I could climb somewhere he couldn't.</p>

<p>Tragically childish, I know, but that's what was in my brain.</p>

<p>I climbed past where he had been, and balanced precariously on two
thin branches, upon either of which I would not be very comfortable
with my full weight, but distributed across the two was okay.</p>

<p>I picked and dropped from there for a while until I couldn't reach
anymore, and I thought about humane ways of training monkeys to pick
the olives, for they would be able to reach *every* olive on the tree.
I would want them to be happy while working, and not forced into
labor.  But what would motivate a monkey to pick olives?  I didn't
want to starve them unless they worked, but just have them choose to
work, with all their other comforts provided.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I left the tree and joined a few people on a much smaller tree.  I
climbed a bit and immediately broke a branch at its base, and kinda
lowered myself down out of the tree to the ground.  I felt bad at
first, but no one else seemed phased, and there was a guy pruning the
shit out of the tree anyway.  I just sat and plucked all the olives
off the branch until we moved on to another tree.</p>

<p>Met Rad (sp), who said his name means thunder in Arabic, speaks
really good English and is actually trained as a network engineer.
Rad, Sarah, David and I worked on a tree while David told a ten minute
version of the Kicks are for Trids joke.  Sarah quite enjoyed it which
quite surprised me given that she seems to have never enjoyed any of
*my* jokes, but I've never actually told her a long joke.</p>

<p>I told David the story of Moe and Joe, which he and Rad enjoyed and
Sarah quit paying attention to, although she had complained near the
beginning of the joke that I was telling a joke at the same tree where
the Trid joke had been told, though Sarah had moved on to the next
tree.</p>

<p>"There's still work to be done here," explained David simply.</p>

<p>Rain sprinkled on us a few times, but Sarah got a picture of me
and Francois and I took one of her, and everything was great.</p>

<p>Time to go and the Rad was like, "hey I wanna show you guys
something," and brought us to where he said he uncovered a hand
grenade that had no pin but wasn't detonated.</p>

<p>Holy shit.  Some people hypothesized it may have been planted there
as a ghetto landmine.  We called B'tselem, an organization with some
clout and experience who will apparently come out tomorrow and check
it out.</p>

<p>Headed back, and the driver said the gunshot we had heard had hit
the case of his passenger side mirror.  Woah.</p>
