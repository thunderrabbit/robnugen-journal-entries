Just saw most of Patch Adams starring Robin Williams.? I was surprised when The Girl died; I saw she was going to have an issue, and wondered how it would be resolved.? How could ol' Patch say "now now; play nice," after the incident, but I guess by killing both involved, it's not an issue.  


Kudos to the real Patch Adams for having the courage to be different and silly.
