Starting with a rectangular carpet measuring 9 by 12 units, we need to carpet a square room 10 by 10 units and a rectangular hallway 1 by 8 units.

The carpet may be cut into exactly three (3) pieces.  One piece measuring 1 by 8.  The other two (2) pieces must fit together to make a square 10 by 10.

This problem was presented to us when I was in trigonometry in high school.  My instructor said he would give an A for the semester to anyone who could solve it.  I knew a good deal when I saw it.  I spent three days on the problem, solved it and coasted through the rest of the semester.  He made good on his promise, but said he would never make such an offer again.

(thanks to Dude for correcting the original problem.  Not 12 x 8....   12 x 9!!)
