Oh my gosh Flock is getting even cooler!!? And by "getting cooler" I mean I am discovering more features that have been here all along!  


I'm writing this blog entry *without* being connected to the internet.? I wrote the one on Patch Adams, and then carefully saved the text so I could close flock and not lose what I wrote, but then when I open it back up...? the entry is already saved!!!!!  


Flock has a local copy of *all* my blog entries, any of which I can edit and (I imagine) update when I get back online!  


Wow!!
