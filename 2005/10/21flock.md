[flock.com](http://flock.com) promises to be a new type of web browser, which breaks the concept of just being a single user in search of the last page of the internet.   It's supposed to let people's browsing experiences merge together in some sort of internetally related hyperweb (I just made that term up) of similar interests that organically come out of browsing and linking slash bookmarking things we like.
