<p>Ramallah means "hill of God."  Traveling to the hill of God
requires traveling through un-Godlike conditions, nothing like what
Heaven should be.  Roads all pot-holed and speed-bumped and
occassionally semi-blocked with rather large random piles of concrete
chunks or other rubbish. </p>

<p>The hour drive would be about 20 minutes except for the condition
of the road and a checkpoint which disallows vehicles to pass.  We had
to get out of our bus, walk along a rough gravel path with razor wire
borders, through a one way revolving gate, all within an otherwise
desolate area with halting stages of construction projects all around,
with the basic plan of sealing the checkpoint with a big fucking
wall.</p>

<p>The new, far-larger waiting area is under construction.  This will
be for Palestinians who are trying to exit the Ramallah area or
something.  I'm still not 100% sure on terminology, but I think it's
for Palestinians who are trying to exit the West Bank.</p>

<p>Once we got through the checkpoint, we piled into a taxi and headed the rest of the way to a hotel.</p>

<p>The following pics can all be described as between the checkpoint and the hotel we used in Ramallah.</p>

<p>We've arrived at a hotel in Ramallah where we will have training
for the Olive Harvest.  Got about 8 trainees chillin' in chairs now
while the trainers get their stuff set up.</p>

<p>Present at the training:</p>

<p>Gabriel
<br />Sarah
<br />Ulf
<br />Per
<br />Gunter
<br />Caorla
<br />Johan
<br />Rob</p>

<p>Sections: hopes and fears, culture, security, checkpoints, etc</p>

<p>Our hopes: learn and educate friends, contribute to people on the
ground via ISM, support someone who is living in crisis and tell
people back home what is happening, have moments of inspiration,
prepare materials for work back at home, hope ISM can make some
progress with issues within the organization, hope I have a good
experience meeting friends in Gaza, learn more and more and be useful
in this difficult situation, doing our best for the people here,
report back to friends and produce some written materials.</p>

<p>Suggestion that we write down our experiences; our peers cannot
believe it's true how people are treated here.</p>

<p>Our fears: don't want to be hurt, don't want to be arrested, don't
want to be deported, was afraid I wouldn't be able to get in, afraid
of not getting the chance to do what we wanted to do, a bit afraid of
what we might see, but trying to be mentally prepared. afraid of not
being allowed to come back into the country, afraid for the
Palestinians, afraid of infighting within Palestinians, afraid of an
intifada, fears about ISM internal structure and ISM's role in the
conflict.  Fear that ISM cannot adapt to new needs of Palestinians.
Afraid of losing my written / audio / video / photographic evidence of
what we see here.</p>

<p class=date>11:14am IST Sunday 09 October 2005</p>

<p>Interesting that we are seeing some of the interal problems with
ISM: he said she said there are too many trainers and who will do what
part of what, etc.</p>

<p>This training is going quite nicely.  A lot of the stuff I have
heard/seen before in YRUU anti-racism training and in my men's group,
so it seems to be coming naturally.</p>

<p>We did a role play as activists with soldiers screaming at us, and
I just opened up like in men's group, allowing him to scream and
threaten, etc.</p>
