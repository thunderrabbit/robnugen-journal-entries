A few minutes after downloading, (given that I've already got a blog  
set up (thanks, Dude!)) I am writing to my blog from flock's  
interface. I sure hope they don't abuse my password which I've given  
to my flock browser.  
  


I think I should be able to *do things* with the blog entries listed  
in the flock blog window (like edit the one on flock instead of having  
to write this new one), but maybe that's coming soon to a feature list  
near you.  


((ah!! I found it; I just have to doubleclick to edit the entry))  
  


For the record, this is flock version 0.5pre  


  
  


Hmmmm. I don't see a way to specify into which category this blog entry is stored.
