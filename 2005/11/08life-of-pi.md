Completely wonderful story.

  
I loved the ironies in narration, like, "the experience itself was different than that of our imaginations, where we sunned ourselves with fat bellies after the picnic like lions on the Savannah, then tottered home under the glorious painting presented by the Heavens in the evening. We died."

  
I laughed several times.  
  
I want so much for the story to be true. It truly does prove the courage of life can overcome astonishing adversity.   
  
I cried twice near the end.  
  
How funny to see me working so hard to write this description. _Life of Pi_ rules.
