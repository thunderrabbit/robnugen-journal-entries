Just found a new site called [YouTube](https://youtube.com/), which has just [received funding](https://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/08/0255216&from=rss), which means to me they could have a good thing going.





The front of the site looks so much like google and gmail's front page that my brain thought it must be associated with google.





Sign up by [clicking here](https://www.youtube.com/signup.php?referer=thunderrabbit) and I'll get a referral.





I'm quite impressed with the site.  I just uploaded two videos; it made thumbnails, permalinks; gave me HTML code to embed videos on my pages... and it's fast and free.
