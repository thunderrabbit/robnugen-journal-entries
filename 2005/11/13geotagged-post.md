This is the first post I've written after installing [Ravi's GeoPress - Wordpress Plugin for tagging your posts with location](http://www.dronamraju.com/blog/2005/11/geopress-wordpress-plugin-for-tagging-your-posts-with-location-info.html).  I have put my West Gray address below this entry, and labled it 1211WGray.  Clicked Embed Map and Save this location.

Now clicking publish....

No embedded map..  I wonder if it's a problem with the string I put in the address field.  It was "1211 West Gray, Houston, Texas, 77019"   I'm going to change it to "77019" and publish again.

Wow cool..   the map didn't show up, but an email from Ravi showed up... I have forgotten to add a code in my entry.
Specifically, insert_yahoo_map in all upper-case as below:

INSERT_YAHOO_MAP
