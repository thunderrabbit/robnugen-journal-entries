No students in my lesson today so I am glad I brought my computer so I
can do some work for AB.  I am continuing with the Modernization of my
Legacy PHP application based on the book described at
https://mlaphp.com

    Modernize Your Legacy PHP Application
    Get your code under control
    in a series of small, specific steps.

    by Paul M. Jones

In addition to simplifying the code, it has given me a refresher on
what I wrote!
