Exciting MKP Tokyo news!

I sent this to my online Integration Group.

    I just got confirmation: I will be co-facilitating a 3-week online
    MKP introduction called The Men's Work https://mkpusa.org/themenswork/
	with Paul Newell, who is currently co-facilitating it in the US.

    On Fridays, 7pm - 8:30pm (Japan time), November 3rd, 10th, and
    17th, we will do this online training for men in Tokyo.

    Once we run this 3 week series of meetings a couple of times, I
    will create a new men's circle in Gotanda (Tokyo) on Fridays for
    men who are interested.  Once those Gotanda men have sat in circle
    for a few months, I will do a Mission Statement workshop with
    them.

    Once we have two circles humming along, I plan to invite an MKP
    man from overseas to Japan to teach facilitation skills to men who
    are interested.  My want is to get more and more circles started
    in Japan so we can create a groundswell movement to have enough
    energy to do NWTAs here in Japan.
