    I am glad the lesson worked well for you; I hope everyone else
    enjoyed it!

    Thank you for the notes and letting me know it went well.  Unless
    there are any big problems, let's continue this style.  I think in
    Part 1 we should just have one question, or have everyone choose
    one question, like Zumi nearly did.  Next week I will ask you to
    think of the question, so please think about one to ask.

    After we answer your question in Part 1 next week, I will ask for
    a volunteer to prepare a question for the following week.

    See you soon!
