I did MT3 livestream today, but have not made time to add an episode.

I attended online men's circle this morning, but was distracted with
emails.

Kevin's website is throwing memory errors, probably because old
version of site needs upgrading.  I contacted his provider about
getting it upgraded.

I am on the train headed to SCC, but forgot to bring my tea cup so I
probably have to use a paper cup (or go without tea).
