Back in the day, I collected images that were funny, and put them in a
directory called "funny" in my file system.

I just found another [funny pic on FB](https://www.facebook.com/ModernTexas/photos/a.980036042149994/1200525840101012/?type=3&theater), and am putting it here in my `funny/`
directory
