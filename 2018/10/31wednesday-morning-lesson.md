The lessons I teach on Wednesday morning used to be on Thursday
mornings.  They were one of the first lessons I taught for JB.  Pretty
convenient when Lin and I lived near Kawasaki station, but now it
takes over an hour to go each way for an hour lesson.

Once I win the lottery, this will be one of the first lessons I
release because I have to leave the house by 5:45 to get a seat on the
train on the way there (or leave by 6:15 and stand for 40 minutes
total on (two) trains).


Two years ago, Mayumi gave me
[Hanayama Marble](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hanayama+marble+images&ia=images).
After playing with it for weeks, I nearly solved it, but in a fit of
frustration gave up and looked up the answer online.  Upon seeing the
solution, I thought "ahhhh crap of course!!!"  It is such an elegant
solution and I was nearly there.

Four weeks ago, in this class, we started playing a pattern matching
word game.  For fun, I started with the same word one of the students
had started with.

* Haneda Airport
* LA International Airport
* Mt Fuji
* Kobe Airport

I thought they would be able to solve it quickly, but this went on for
four weeks until I finally had to pull the plug because one of the
students expression was like *fuck this*.  I ended up giving them the
answer and the same student was like "ahhhh crap of course!!!"

So in honor of that, today I brought my Hanayama Marble puzzle and
left it with one of the students to play with.
