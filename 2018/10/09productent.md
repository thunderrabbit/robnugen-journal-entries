Today wasn't as productive as I had planned, but I got some good stuff
done.

4:30am meeting with Boysen, and should have a landing page for The
Men's Work soon.

8:00am IL lesson in which we talked about Tsukiji and 2020 Olympics

came home to work on MT3, but ended up just sleeping

7:00pm Tokyo Men's Circle https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/

8:06pm someone killed themselves in Seijogakuenmae (a station along my
train line)

9:30pm though trains were slow, got to ride from Yoyogi Uehara with
Lin.  In Yoyogi-Koen, we waited until the next train arrived,
terminated, and had everyone come over to our train so we could go to
Yoyogi Uehara.

11:30pm wrote this entry after arriving home and taking a shower.
