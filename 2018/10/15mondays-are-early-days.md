##### 14:25 Monday 15 October 2018 JST

On Mondays for the past year or more, I have been waking up at 5am on
Mondays to work at IL for an hour from 8am to 9am.  Today we talked
about the new fish market in Toyosu, and how at 40 hectares, it is 1.7
times larger than the fish market that was in Tsukiji (which I never
visited during the fish auctions).

The days of visiting those fish auctions are over; one of the
bugs/features of Toyosu location is tourists are not allowed in the
same room as the auctions.  I don't really care one way or another,
but I imagine it's somehow better to more easily keep the place
cleaner.

After that lesson I ate two bowls worth of raw salad buffet at .RAW
for 900 yen, and then taught at UG.  Akari, Masa, Eri, Ryuya, Taka,
Shinji, and Kazu were there.  No Kenji today.

I am headed home now because it seems no one else will attend the
<!-- mixed gender --> meeting tonight.
