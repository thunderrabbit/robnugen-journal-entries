SOGO was a lot easier for me this weekend probably because it was not
so blasting hot as it's been during the summer.  I was basically able
to do most of the exercises without giving up partway through as I
have done in the past.

After the workout, I joined a small group for lunch at a Thai
restaurant.  At my table: Asaad, Kino, Alex, Rafaela, Tatsuya, and
maybe someone else.

While heading back to Yoyogi Park, I was entertained that Rafaela saw
Dominique and someone going shopping so she was like, "bye!" to us and
bounced.

Back in Yoyogi, Masa was with Yo-T (sp), Leo, Pierre (?), and a couple
others doing some kinda game with jenga blocks.  Stacking the blocks
on people as a human sculpture.  Several different movement games
including Hand Dance While God Attacks, Animal Flow 3D, and the
finale: Dodge String.  We should have a video of that up soon; Masa
said he wants to edit the video before posting.

After that I headed deeper into Yoyogi Park to find Michael and Yuka's
party with lots of people, food, drinks, bubbles, and games.  I got to
meet Yuka's grandmother Hiroko, who could sit in 正座 like a champ.

Talked to Asaad more about his work in transportation engineering
(physics of bridges, tunnels, embankments, etc) and about men's
circle, including [The Men's Work](https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/themenswork/)
