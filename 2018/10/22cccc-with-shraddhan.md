I met Shraddhan in Iidabashi to hear about his Creative Capitalism
game.  I don't have a full sense of how to play it, but we had fun
playing a small version which resulted in six piles of 72 yen each,
plus a 5 yen coin in the center.

The idea is that these will be seed money for six different projects.
