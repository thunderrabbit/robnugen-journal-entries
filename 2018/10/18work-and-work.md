Today I got to hear about the production of silicone for the first
time via Hitomi.  Then about generating electricity with hydrogen (for
the nth time) and then other ways to save energy for the nth time.

Just renamed class.translator.php to Translator.php so it can be
autoloaded.

Falling asleep now as I write this while on the train headed to
Akihabara.  Nap now and hope I wake up.

Yay I woke up in time.

While sitting on the local train from Shinjuku, I have just slammed
through renaming the files for five classes.
