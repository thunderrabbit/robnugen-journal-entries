On my way to SOGO there was a blue car amongst the stalls where people
were selling bread and beads and stuff.  Huh.  Old car looks new.  It
was old, and I asked the guy how old it was.  Older than me by 2 years.

After SOGO I talked to him (in English) for about 20 minutes, and met
his daughter, who has an accupuncture place nearby.  Neat!  Might go
sometime.
