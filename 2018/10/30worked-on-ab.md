Still going through MLAPHP for the AB project.  I guess I am about
halfway through the step of naming all the class definition files so
they can be loaded via the autoloader.

During this process I found [Mabl](https://www.mabl.com/) which
features a short domain name and some tools for automated testing.
Pretty easy onboarding, and they are giving the site a good onceover
every day.

Eventually need to create a staging system with fake data so they can
give the backend a daily look as well.
