I chatted with Dora for 1.75 hours on the phone.  She had some amazing
insights on my presentation for MKP stuff.  Plus a course she has
enjoyed taking, designed to help people start their business projects.

While talking, I walked from Nishi-Azabu to the other end of Yoyogi
Park before realizing I had intended to turn right *before* Yoyogi
Park, or actually maybe even turn at Omotesando.  Anyway, it was all
good because I found an earthworm still alive on the sidewalk and
hopefully gave it another chance at living by placing it in the shade
under some leaves.

For some reason I believed I did not have any water to quench the
worm, but it turns out I *did* have water.  Weird.  It was pretty much
too late to go back and quench him by the time I realized it.

Neat to crisscross the city.  I walked across an intersection that I
had walked across perpendicularly many times.
