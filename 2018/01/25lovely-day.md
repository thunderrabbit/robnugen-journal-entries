Great online Integration Group today.  Just six men in the call (we
recently have had as many as 11 or 12).  I was asked to facilitate
twice (joy for me) and both men said it was very helpful.  yay!

Headed to work now, slightly later than my arrive-early target, but
still early enough to be on time.  The weather is clear blue chilly
with snow melting in the sun and frozen solid in the shade.
