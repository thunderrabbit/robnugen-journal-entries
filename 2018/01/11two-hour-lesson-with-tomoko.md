Today was the first of five 2-hour lessons this month at SCC.  Today I
helped Tomoko by making corrections to her written English.  She plans
to present the features of some of her company's products.  Pretty
cool stuff like elevators and batteries, and elevators that run on
batteries.  We studied up in their cafeteria on the 4th floor, and
then I went down the escalator to the third floor and went out the
exit I had never gone out before (but had seen many times).  Neat!
