Now I am in Akihabara, across the street from GG lesson which starts
at 18:30.

I bought a trackball mouse to replace the one I had before which seems
to just mysteriously and annoyingly not work anymore.  This time I
will keep the receipt because I think the old one konked out before
its warranty was up.
