This clip includes 1066 frames.  I didn't upload clips the past 2 or 3
times I worked on the track because it took a long time to add the
first three ribs to the edge of the largest marble's track.

Now I am in the process of getting some characters off the set because
they are just じゃま and wasting time during filming.  I already have
the brothers wasting enough time, plus the guy in the back trying to
make his way around the currently-highest point of the largest
marble's track.

I have been on my computer too long today already so might not upload
images.

Sorry future me, but current me is going to take a bit of a break.

I just streamed for 1.25 hours and uploaded a new video clip that
features 8 more seconds of video than in the previously uploaded clip.
