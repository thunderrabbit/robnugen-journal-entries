Had a little nap for 3 hours or so

Distracted now watching Logan Lucky while writing and trying to
remember whsat I was going to write.

While sleeping I guess I felt the plane dip a bit and it appeared in
my dream

<p class="dream">We descended and hovered down by the water down by
the cruise ship.  I didn't recognize any of my old friends there, but
was optimistic there were some onboard.  It seemed we were a couple of
days after everyone else, so the cheerful arrival high had waned. I
remembered I had not brought Francois on this trip, and it would be
even more acute here on the ship.  I saw some other stuffed animals
and considered another replacement but decided not to.  Woke up soon
thereafter</p>

Writing very slowly, it's now 3 hours to Haneda.
