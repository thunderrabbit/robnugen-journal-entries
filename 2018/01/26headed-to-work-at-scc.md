Three hours of lessons in SCC today; looking forward to it!

On the way there, I hope to figure out why my local version of
mypowercircle.org will not compile with Hugo.  bah.  it was supposed
to be easy!!

Ah. I had gotten stuck trying to add Japanese language version of the
site, but never got it working.  It's better to just have an actual
Japanese speaker make the Japanese site, so I cut out the Japanese
content from the site and now it's working again.

Mizuho, Liliko, and Tomoe.
