Build Your Speaker Bio is Soness's most recent course.  It solves the
problem of having something to give to TEDx organizers when they ask
for a speaker bio which they can use in marketing materials.

Prior to starting this course I did not see myself as a speaker, so
why should I write a bio?  I still cannot honestly say I see myself as
having something worth *speaking* about, but I can see huge value in
the course.  We are writing bios that really connect to the essence of
our selves and our messages.  Getting down into all the good parts of
me that I do not feel comfortable showing to the world.

Maybe I can be a speaker!
