I worked for four companies yesterday.  First was my lesson in
Akabanebashi for Tariq.  Then walked to Nishi Azabu for MR
Laboratories client (company DNE yet).  Then walked across the Nishi
Azabu intersection to a lesson for TESS.  Then bus and train to
Kawasaki for 2 hours of lessons at my favorite, SCC.  Came home and
had one more lesson for MR Laboratories.
