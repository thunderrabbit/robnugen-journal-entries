## 17:18 Sunday 31 December 2017 -02 (SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil)

## 23:19 Sunday 31 December 2017 +04 (Dubai - United Arab Emirates)

## 04:20 Monday 01 January 2018 JST (Tokyo - Japan)

We arrived and went to the baggage claim but, fortunately thanks to
Lin checking first, we discovered we could *not* get our checked
baggage in Dubai when staying in hotels in the airport.

But what's awesome: the guy was like beep beep beep and said our
baggage would be redirected to Haneda just like that boom. Automatic
scanners and stuff.  I know it's both amazing and meh, makes sense.
Also awesome: we thereby did not have to pay a fee for overweight bags
despite this airport allegedly being strict.

We had to go through security again, but I guess we couldn't get our
bags because they don't want us to escape into the city without visas,
which we don't have.

Lin bought eyeliner during our 15+ minute walk to the hotel in
Concourse C, and is buying a T-shirt (and probably other stuff) now.
I showered and considered shaving but nah it can wait until we get
back.
