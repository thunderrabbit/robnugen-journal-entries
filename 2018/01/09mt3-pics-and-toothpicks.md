I have worked on MT3 a few times since getting back.  A couple days
ago, progress was super slow and I did not even export a video clip,
much less upload one.  Today I got much further, after having figured
out a way to lift the bridge, and then I had the green cutter guy make
some curved toothpicks which will be used for rail supports to keep
the large marbles on track during the 2nd to last U-turn.

The little brother has kicked the chopstick ends back behind the stage
so I don't have to worry about not moving them anymore.  His big
brother is watching him.

After having raised the lower bridge, these three characters are about
to walk up simultaneously (up) toward the stage.

Here is the overview of the set now (after I disassembled the light
fragile triple tripod with upside down tripod).
