My Android phone is not plugged in, but when I took it out of my
pocket, I found it "Installing system update" with an eye-candy white
circle to distract me from the fact that it's doing the update while
on battery, without my having asked for the update.

It's rebooting now, so seems the update completed. I hope!

Now it says "Android is upgrading" with a subtitle "Optimizing app 28
of 271"

Update and reboot complete
