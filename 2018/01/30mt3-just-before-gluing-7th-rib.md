Recorded 2 seconds of video today, including having the little brother
spin around and fall off the top end of the track splitter.  The big
brother started to run down to the area to look for his little brother
but he won't find him...  I have decided to have the little brother
crawl out from between the stages in about 6 movie-seconds from now,
which may be in 2 months from now?  .. maybe just one month, but it
should be great.
