I woke up early to take pics of the snow and then helped scoop some of
it up.  I cleared a couple paths in a couple hours.  It was pretty
warm while working.

It's about dark now; I have been inside on my computer, preparing to
do my US taxes, on time this year (for a change).

Oh and I did an hour of MT3, but did not write an entry for it.  I
added the fourth rib, and got my 8th subscriber.

Now getting ready for co-gender meeting.

Great meeting, but got home late after talking in the park and
slipping in ice 3 times on the way home.
