Thanks to https://mothereff.in/html-entities and
http://japaneseemoticons.me/crying-emoticons/ for helping write the
Japanese entry.  But man it took 2.5 hours to write.  I hope someone
(including possibly future me) appreciates it!

What's amazing is that when writing this entry, I actually overwrote
the other entry because I originally named this entry "studied
japanese".  Thank Emacs for saving a backup copy before the overwrite
happened.
