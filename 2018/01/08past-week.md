Today is the last day of winter holiday for me.  Lin and I have been
back home for a week, during which I have mostly worked on Godot, read
_The Power of Now_, watched movies with Lin, and worked a bit on MT3.

This past Saturday, we went to see her family for Happy New Year, and
I have been chatting with her niece in English on LINE since then.

We watched The Last Jedi (Star Wars episode 8) last night in the
theater (Lin slept a little) and then The Phantom Menace (episode 1)
at home via Amazon (199 yen rental for 48 hours) (I slept a little and
Lin slept a lot).

Oh, and this is the time that Meltdown and Spectre are making the
news.  Intel stock is down a bit, but probably not for long.
