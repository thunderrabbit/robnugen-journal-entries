## 23:56 Monday 01 January 2018 JST

We have arrived back in Haneda and are in a taxi back home.  Didn't
realize trains would not be running very late so yay for 12000 yen for
stale smoke flavored taxi.

Last train was at 11:51 and would require two transfers, including
from KQ Kawasaki to JR Kawasaki station.

I get to work on MT3 tomorrow yayyy!
