I discovered that Bitquest now has a Doge server.  I jumped on and
added 25 Doge to my wallet there.  dognamedsteve helped me by getting
me started with a compass, diamond pick, diamond shovel, chestplate
and some other basic gear.  Nice!  I started digging a burrow after
walking off the end of a road near a heart-looking room up in the trees.
