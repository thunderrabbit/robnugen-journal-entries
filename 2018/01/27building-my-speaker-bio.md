I am taking Soness's
[Build Your Speaker Bio course](https://courses.yourspeakingjourney.com/courses/build-your-speaker-bio-and-media-kit),
learning techniques for how to get great photos for my bios.  She
brought in
[branding photographer Heidi Hapanowicz](https://www.heidihapanowicz.com/)
who is giving great tips on how to find a great photographer and what
to expect from them.  Expect to pay *minimum* of a few hundred bucks,
but you should not have to micromanage nor dig through hundreds of
photos.  They should find the best 4 or 5 per outfit to show you.
