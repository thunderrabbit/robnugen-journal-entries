The court of support meetings are being held for seven weeks after the
LT1 I attended in Portland on March 9th weekend.  Each man will take
the role of a different archetype, King, Warrior, Magician, Lover, as
described in many places, including
[King, Warrior, Magician, Lover: Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91781.King_Warrior_Magician_Lover),
and bite sized
[Four Archetypes of the Mature Masculine on Art of Manliness](https://www.artofmanliness.com/2011/07/31/king-warrior-magician-lover-introduction/).

I was in the role of Magician this morning. I will be the Man in the
Middle next week, presenting my situation and getting guidance from
the archetypes around me.
