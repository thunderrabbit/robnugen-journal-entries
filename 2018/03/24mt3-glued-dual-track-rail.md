I have two sets of notes descrbing what characters should do.  The
Reversable Guy is trying to figure out why the stage is not rotating.
The green head guy is about to glue a small stick under the ball
splitter.

Meanwhile, Candycane Mom has just put the dual track rail in place
down at another ball split point.  It will hold medium-sized and
small-sized marbles.
