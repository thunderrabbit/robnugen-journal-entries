Next plans in the Marble Track movie:

* he little brother has just start to walk near the ramps; I do not know where he will go next, but probably off the scene to go look for something fun to do.
* The reversible guy about to go back to the switch to make the stage rotate toward the right again.
* Candy cane mom has to figure out what track to build next.
* Green head guy is about to place rails for a small marble track that comes down from the not quite parallel splitter.
* Gluer and cutter characters have nothing to do at the moment.
