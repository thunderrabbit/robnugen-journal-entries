I sketched out this speech a few days ago as I decided to switch my
[Complice](https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu) Goal 0 from "Take Counseling Course Online" to "Speak on stage
in Tokyo"



    What is your mission in life?
    
    What is it that drives you, that inspires you to wake up each day, knowing what you plan to do, knowing it might not work out that way TODAY, but knowing that on the whole, you are driving toward something.
    
    I'm not talking about goals daily goals weekly goals 5 year plan 10 year plan. I'm talking about my mission for me it's that unattainable optimal Target in life that's concrete but elusive.
    
    Maybe concrete is not the right word. It's succinct. it's easy for me to do a litmus test to determine if any particular action is assigned with what I ultimately want to be known for in life. Is this moving me closer toward my target Mission or not?
    
    What is your mission in life?
    
    What do you ultimately want to be known for in life. What do you want to be on your epitaph?
    
    Yes I mean that message on your head stone when you die. This is life out death stuff. what will you create with your life?
    
    It's my LinkedIn profile title. Half of my mission is my title. That gives me some flexibility for how to implement my mission.
    
    For me it's my kids. I want to raise them into productive adults who have self driven self created missions in life. And to be clear, I don't mean my biological children. It's too late for that. Unless we have a Surprise. I'm ready now, I think. Okay I'm readiER.
    
    I can remember asking my dad when he would be a granddad. I was perhaps seven years old. At that time, I didn't know I had anything to do with that decision.
    
    ....... more to come
    
    I create a safe and empowered world by listening and sharing my heart.
