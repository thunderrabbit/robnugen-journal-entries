It snowed "today" and was 2 degrees C all day long.  It's apparently
going up to 16 or 18 degrees C tomorrow.

I chatted with Delayna who I've known since our mutual YRUU days back
in late 1980s, culminating with
[ConCon 1988](https://new.robnugen.com/journal/1988/08/23/concon/). Looking
forward to seeing her
