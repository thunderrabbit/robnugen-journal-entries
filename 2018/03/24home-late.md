Lin's mom just got home; she had been at the clinic cause her eye was
all red. From her description to Lin, I don't understand what we might
call it in English, but apparently it happened today while she was at
work.  She was not able to see well and called a different number
while trying to call Lin.  Dr gave her some medicine and tomorrow she
will stay home from work.

Lin is saying her eyes bled internally.  Apparently she might not be
able to see.  Yikes stripes.  I hope she can see perfectly well from now on.
