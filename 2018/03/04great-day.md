Went to SOGO for workout with about 50 people in attendance.  Great
weather and great workout.  I met Shell, Koji, Tyler, and others, but
cannot remember now.

Went to lunch with Lisa at Laska and chatted with her a bit, and got
to see a video of the type of dancing she is doing.

Went down to Tsujido for karaoke after recording video at karaoke with
Kai, Mitsue, and Soness as the stars.  Got to see long-time-no-see
Yuji, and longer-time-no-see Jesse.  Plus got to meet all-time-no-see
Vesna.  Thanks to Soness for organizing and inviting, and giving me
some crazy sock-shoes!

Came back for lesson with Sarumama but got her cancellation request on
my way home.  She said she will pay for the lesson.

Walking toward home, I saw the guy next to the telescope stand I
sometimes see with or without a telescope.  This time he had his
telescope connected to a laptop which could see the image.  Much
easier to use than back in the day when we had to squat down and
squint up into the eyepiece.  He showed me a picture he had taken of a
nebula, which was apparently 120 snapshots overlaid on each other to
get sufficient brightness.  It looked quite good for such a small
telescope!  (3 inches or so)
