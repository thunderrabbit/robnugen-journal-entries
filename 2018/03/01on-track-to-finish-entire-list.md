I am on track to finish my todo list today on
[Complice](https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu).  I got my AB work
complete, though there is the possibility they will want one more
change on it.  I am prepared for work tomorrow and now just gotta
write this journal entry, studying Japanese, work tonight, Japanese
lesson tonight with Mel, ..

I watched episode 6(?) of Kakegurui.  They did not have the subtitles
added yet, but I could understand the overall meaning because the
acting is so over-the-top, plus explained visually (given that it's a
tv show)

I signed up for beeminder but am not sure if/how/when I will use it.
