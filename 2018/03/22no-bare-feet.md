Lazona has a new green faux grass field in the middle of the open air
area, featuring firm inflatable plastic chairs, a geodesic dome tent,
a sakura tree in full bloom, and a sign saying no playing ball, no
music, no work(?), no events, and no bare feet.

Wait, what?  No work?  Maybe it doesn't say that.

Wait, what?  No bare feet?  Maybe they haven't ever tried walking
barefoot on the surface.  It feels really nice to me!  I am glad I
walked on it before seeing the sign.  When I saw it, I was like, HA!
They have no clue what they are talking about.
