I think of it as Liar Bird because it ostensibly can create recordings
of me saying anything. I recorded 30+ sentences using Mr Big voice.
He speaks very slowly and deliberately, sortakinda like an Ent in Lord
of Rings movies.  The results are far less than stellar, but they are
reasonable for a beta, plus only having recorded the minimum number of
sentences.
