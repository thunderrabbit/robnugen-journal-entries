In a single day, I can take maybe 20 or 30 frames, which adds a couple
of seconds to the final movie.

Yesterday, I worked 2 hours on Marble Track 3, including adding a new
dimension of planning to the project:

I wrote notes to script out the next 5 weeks (or so) for the
Reversable Guy (character whose head looks largely the same when
facing forward or backward) as he debugs why the stage is slowing
down.  For what I have sketched out so far, in final movie time, it
will be like (323-183) / 12 = approx 12 seconds of video.

The end of this video includes 2 seconds of footage which I sketched
out in this way.
