Actually have gotten three (3) meetings done online: Prentiss and Ari
helped with Mankind Project Tokyo; Ari said he will write some stuff
for either
[Mankind Project Tokyo Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ManKind-Project-Tokyo/)
or [My Power Circle](https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/).  Oriane and I
checked in with each other on our respective projects.

Planning to ask which inkan I can use for my personal seal today;
maybe I will go do that now on my way to work at TY.
