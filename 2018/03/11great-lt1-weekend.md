Bunch of great guys here in Oregon for the LT1 and ST1 dual training.
I attended ST1 (Staff Training 1) in Perth last year and am attending
LT1 (Leadership Training 1) in Oregon this weekend.  Got to meet Alan
who I know from my online men's circle, and met Mike P with dredlocks
who I had met online as well.  Also met Richard and was like "woah!"
when I recognized I knew him from online.  Have not yet seen Scotty K,
who I also know from online, but I told him on Thursday that I'd be
here and he said he might come down.

Sad news is that I am an idiot and did *not* tell Collenie Beanie that
I would be here, and I did not realize until she was like, "wait,
which Portland?" on FB that I had effed up.  I was so focused on just
the weekend that I did not tell anyone except the men here.  Colleen
said she would have driven down to see me!  Oh god I am such an idiot.
I will be back by next year though, so I will be hella sure to let her
know ahead of time!

Got the blessing of the community tonight before dinner and John H
started to fundraise a bit for me to help start MKP Japan.  He wrote
me a check which covers my flight over here.  Not sure how to cash it
though unless they have my bank in this area.  Talked to John for a
while tonight, and he seems to have a wide range of detailed info
about a wide range of historical, financial, naval, and medical
topics.
