An interesting thing is happening with the stage rotation.  Last week I noticed
a chopstick was sticking out too far for the stage to turn all the way
around, and this time it has hit the wall and begun to hamper the
rotation of the stage.

I think the cutter guy might cut the offending chopstick and have the
stage spring forward, which I may do in slow motion again, like when
the manager got yanked by the spinning bearing while they tried to
wrangle it.

In waking reality, I stopped to let the glue dry after I placed the
medium/small marble splitter track (the track which will have the
medium sized marble veer to the left while small marbles continue
forward).
