    To pursue his dream of travel, Rob gave up his comfortable life in
    Texas, including house, car, cat, and fiance. Just to see what
    else is out there.

    Fascinated with time, Rob has started a stop-motion animation
    project, likely to take ten years.  He has also started writing a
    novel, which is being presented backwards, one word at a time.

    Walking around barefoot as often as possible, Rob hopes to inspire
    others to do what they like, regardless of what other people may
    think.

    Not knowing what to do in life, Rob often prescribes to Bashar's
    suggestion that people should do what excites them most at any
    given moment.

    At the current ongoing moment, that is organizing peer counseling
    circles for men and women in Tokyo.  Growing from 3 men to 9 men
    and 4 women in two years.
