Today I spent the morning setting up a test image upload page to see why I can't get the main page to work via https.

Frustrating: the test page is working fine.

Working, I  was distracted from online integration group, and then zoned to SCC and found out the manager is leaving soon.

Now in Akihabara about to go to GG lesson.
