After my morning lesson I had a big gap during which I had a big nap
because dang I was tired.  I seem to have gotten over the *jet lag*
(new vocabulary word for some students today).  I was roused by a
security guard when I tried to nap on a grassy field on 3F of Lazona
(next to Eggs N Things (or something)).  But before he roused me, I
got to sleep there about an hour or so, so that was nice.

They are putting a new green fake grass surface in Lazona, to give it
a (fake) park-like atmosphere.  It looks nice; I wonder how functional
it will be.

Headed to JB at 3:30 and just finished a bit ago.  7pm lesson featured
a discussion of WTC7, and 8pm lesson featured intonation practice.
How are you?  How are *you*?
