Right now I am in a coffee shop in Lazona, and about to go to SCC
lessons for 3 hours, and then GG lesson for 1 hour.

Tears were apparently shed by one of the students at SCC; she is
scheduled to present tomorrow and found out today that her
presentation is going to be different than what she expected/practiced
for.  Yikes stripes I wish I could help more, but I suggested some
simplifications that will hopefully make it easier.
