Chillin at airport now in Portland, about to go home.  Sad that I did
not connect with Colleen or anyone else who may be here.

Ecstatic about deep transformational work and experience I had.

But that's not why I am writing.

Here's my things to do:

1) copy things to do here
2) add new Complice Goal of Connect with Babychan
3) copy my things to do back onto Complice

Okay so here is step one:

    5) get caught up on email
    &) process most email
    2) brush teeth in morning $wf:r:cdd283568d11
    7) write something about my experience $wf:r:6f3d9a1f2ae4
    7) write something else
    1) day off $wf:r:716d40cb45f8
    2) do ten pushups $wf:r:219a438d8f19
    2) eat well $wf:r:dec36bfd8499
    2) fill in contract regarding food $wf:r:0e1b8532c6b9
    8) read something $wf:r:7c12c63d02c2
    6) fly back to Japan
    6) sleep on plane to get back on Japan sleep schedule
    6) go to men's circle
    9) go see my babychan

Okay step two is done.

And neither step one nor step three was required because Complice
saved my work automatically.
