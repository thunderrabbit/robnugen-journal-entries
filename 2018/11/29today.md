##### 17:24 Thursday 29 November 2018 JST

Just finished four lessons at SCC: Naoko, Liliko, Hitomi, and Yasu
each had 30 minute lessons, practicing various parts of their
presentations.

During the first two lessons, my nose was running like yuck.  I used a
bunch of toilet paper and tissues blowing all the snot out.

This morning I worked on MT3 for 1.5 hours or so, getting maybe 8
frames taken.  At this point, I am working on version 2 of the
website, which focuses on the characters making the track instead of
me making the characters make the track.

Men's group at 10:30 featured 10 or 11 men, a relatively big group.  I
had a great cry during which I realized I feel tons of shame and
sadness about how much I have *not* accomplished in Japan.  I should
be making a good living, but I am still paycheck to paycheck and it
sucks.  That is the main reason I cannot go back to US every year.

In other news:

* I will go on Monday to replace *both* fans and the battery in this
computer (MacBook Pro, 2012)
* I have gotten more than half of the classes in AB websites to be
autoloaded per [MLAPHP](https://leanpub.com/mlaphp)
* Will meet Tariq tomorrow to finalize(?) the specs/screens for
version 1 of ConSwi
* In the middle of training at TY, helping Jay with that.
* Great workshop presentation by Dora yesterday, and am inspired to do
  the same myself, but $3000?  See the above-mentioned
  paycheck-to-paycheck comment.
