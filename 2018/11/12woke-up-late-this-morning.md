I usuually set my alarm for 5am on Mondays and Wednesdays so I can
leave the house at 5:45am.  This morning I turned off my 5am alarm and
planned to snooze until my second alarm, but the phone was in silent
mode so that alarm did not sound.  Fortunately, Lin had set an alarm
for 5:35.  I had already packed my computer so I got out early enough
to catch my preferred train, featuring enough seats that I can sit and
write, or snooze, which I plan to do now.
