Today I met with Tariq and Dipendra to talk about ConSwi.  They are
all excited about the graphics and I am in the camp of getting a
minimum viable product out. I want to empower Dipendra to update the
graphics in the app.  He got a copy of Conswi from Github.  Instead of
giving him write access to the app, I had him create his own account
and push to his own ConSwi.

Although it is a fork, I assume it is not counted as a fork from
Github's point of view.  I wonder if that is possible to make happen.
Probably not if it has not been implemented already.

Dang it is 5:30 and already dark.  I remember our 5pm picture in Sao
Paolo was like noon here.
