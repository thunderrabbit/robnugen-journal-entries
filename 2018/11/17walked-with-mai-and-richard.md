I walked with Mai and Richard as they walked with Fitz.  They let Fitz
off his leash so he could run around in a fenced area, but he just
trotted around instead of doing the
[/r/zoomies](https://reddit.com/r/zoomies) that I expected.

He did a good job sliding down the slide, though he was not able to go
up the slide.

I should have taken pictures of them.
