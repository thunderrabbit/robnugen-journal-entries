Mark rode 4km from the 古民家公園 to our house yesterday to meet Lin
and see Marble Track 3 in person.  He had some great ideas for MT3:

* Encourage teambuilding among youth by giving them a certain set of
  track pieces, tools, and time limit to make a track that fits a
  certain set of requirements.
* Set my camera so the whole set is in focus.
* Add narration or speech bubbles to explain the story in more detail.
