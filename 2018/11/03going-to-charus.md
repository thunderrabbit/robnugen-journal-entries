Lin and I are headed to her sister's for some family thing.  Dinner
and brownies (with coconut yuck).  I forgot to bring any puzzles for
the kids to play with.

Oh, speaking of puzzles, I gave/loaned to Atsuko the kinda-easy
star-shaped ring puzzle that I bought in Brazil.

Now going to see if we can play Minecraft with the kids.
