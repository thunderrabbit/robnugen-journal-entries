I can basically tell how busy I am by how much time I (don't) spend
writing in my journal.  Inverse relationship between entries and busy.
It's not surprising, but just a thing to note.

Recently, my "journaling" has included Marble Track 3 website, and
*that* has included revamping the website a bit.
