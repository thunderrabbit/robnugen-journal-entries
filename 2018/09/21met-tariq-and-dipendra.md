I met Dipendra today, a young man with design chops that far exceed my
own, and even Tariq's.  He is interested in doing the images for
[ConSwi, our swipe game](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi) we
are making in Godot.

We met in a room that used to be a car showroom, but now features a
coffee shop because the car showroom was not making enough money.

I showed Dipendra how to get started with Godot and git.

Now headed home, but I will be back out tonight for Apocrypha, where I
will be telling my TJ Bike story of riding around Japan for 2 months.

Around 11am or so I hope to work on Marble Track 3.
