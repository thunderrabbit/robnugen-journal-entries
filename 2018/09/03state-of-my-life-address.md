1. I have just removed the ## 06:12 Monday 03 September 2018 JST date
   from the top of this journal.  Marking them in h2 tags makes them a
   bit too big for this theme.  I hate to modify my source code to fit
   a theme, but that happened.

2. I recently got the [website for Mable Track
   3](https://marbletrack3.com) (nearly) up to date.  It now has all
   the entries that had been in my journal at
   https://new.robnugen.com/tags/mt3/ and all the entries have an
   `episode_image` in the frontmatter.  Not all the entries have a
   *unique* episode image, but that is another matter.

3. The [episode image placeholder for Marble Track 3](https://b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/website/2018_sep_02_mt3_placeholder.png) includes the
   text "All Episodes (8.97 days)" which is a new thing I just added
   to the site with the help of [Go](https://golang.org/), Youtube's v3 API (both
   of which are Google assets.. hmmm), and
   [Hugo static website generator](https://gohugo.io/).

4. Just this morning I split the source into two files, one that
   actually does the API calls, and one that does all the
   logic to create a list of all my Youtube videos in a TOML file.

5. Until this very moment, I had decided to *not* keep a copy of the
   TOML file in any of my repos, but now I think I will, for a couple
   of reasons.
   * One, so I can show you my
   [TOML file of all Marble Track 3 videos](sorry I am writing without
   wifi at the moment)
   * Two, so the website for Marble Track 3 is easier to recreate
   (without installing <del>Go</del> <ins>extra libraries</ins>)
   * Three, so I can have a history of the file, which currently is *not* sorted by Publish Date, though I would like it to be
     because that would make it easier to figure out what to name the
     livestreams that did not get unique names.
