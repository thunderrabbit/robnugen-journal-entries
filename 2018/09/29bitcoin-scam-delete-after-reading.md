Guys, this is not real.  Basically they got hold of an old dump of
emails and passwords.  If it is still your password, change it
immediately, and all the places you have used it, and use a password
manager ffs.

    Hello!
    I'm a member of an international hacker group.
    
    As you could probably have guessed, your account *redacted* was
    hacked, because I sent message you from it.
    
    Now I have access to you accounts!
    For example, your password for *redacted* is *redacted* 
    
    Within a period from July 7, 2018 to September 23, 2018, you were
    infected by the virus we've created, through an adult website
    you've visited.  So far, we have access to your messages, social
    media accounts, and messengers.  Moreover, we've gotten full damps
    of these data.
    
    We are aware of your little and big secrets...yeah, you do have
    them. We saw and recorded your doings on porn websites. Your
    tastes are so weird, you know..
    
    But the key thing is that sometimes we recorded you with your
    webcam, syncing the recordings with what you watched!  I think you
    are not interested show this video to your friends, relatives, and
    your intimate one...
    
    Transfer $700 to our Bitcoin wallet: *redacted*
    If you don't know about Bitcoin please input in Google "buy BTC".
	It's really easy.
    
    I guarantee that after that, we'll erase all your "data" :D
    
    A timer will start once you read this message. You have 48 hours
    to pay the above-mentioned amount.
    
    Your data will be erased once the money are transferred.
    If they are not, all your messages and videos recorded will be
    automatically sent to all your contacts found on your devices at
    the moment of infection.
    
    You should always think about your security. We hope this case
    will teach you to keep secrets.
	Take care of yourself.
    

I have found this scam posted a few places with various bitcoin
addresses.
