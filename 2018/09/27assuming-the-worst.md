I do not normally catastrophize things, but I am assuming my favorite
Japanese teacher got fed up with me not studying much the past few
weeks.  At the same time, I didn't notice that our lesson package on
[iTalki](https://www.italki.com/i/Bf6Gfd) had run out of lessons, so
(even though she had said this timeslot was always reserved for me)
that was not the case today, it seems.

So anyway, I am sad about my fuckup if that is the case, but trust
that I will learn something about something.
