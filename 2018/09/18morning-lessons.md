Good lesson this morning with just two students.  We talked about
rental おっさん in Japan.  Interesting concept of renting old men
because they are older and presumably wiser.  They?  We?

Walked with Tariq from Akabanebashi to Shibashi while we talked about
future plans for our
[swipe game](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi). He found a
designer who can create excellent graphics.

Did not end up needing my computer, but I have my rolly bag so no
worries.

Rolled to Ginza Line and got back to my station for 411 yen, given
that I have a free pass from Shin Yurigaoka to Noborito.
