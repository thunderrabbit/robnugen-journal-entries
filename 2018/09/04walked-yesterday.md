Yesterday a typhoon grazed Tokyo.  We got some wind, but hardly any
rain.  I left early for men's group to make sure I would be there even
if the trains stopped for the typhoon.

I had loads of time, so I walked from Yoyogi Uehara to Nishi Azabu, by
way of the Snoopy Museum!  The museum costs 2000 yen to enter, so I
skipped it until I have more time and can go with Lin.
