Been a pretty good day today despite the 6-year-old driving me a bit
crazy.  He seems to be a bit entitled and petulant, but maybe that is
my projection.  We played with the vertical labyrinth game, kids
blocks marble track, jenga, and tried to play pictionary, but his
version of the game was to write the words instead of draw them.  Make
sense!

Niece, nephews, and I watched _17 Again_ which was better than I might
have expected.

Walked to the convenience store with nephews to get ice cream.  They
did well navigating back through the twists and turns.
