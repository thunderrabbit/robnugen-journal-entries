BH set up a Slack space for MKP Japan where we can discuss creating
the organization and setting up some trainings.

I got a multi-month fix done for AB; now users can use the same filter
on their custom list page as they can on the main list.  I don't
recall why it was set up this weird way before, but it is better now.
Oh, and they now have a recycle bin function on the custom list page
so it is easier to hide and restore things from their list.  (It used
to take 3 clicks to hide an item (and they could not be restored) but
now it takes 1 click to hide an item, 1 click to reveal hidden items,
and 1 click to restore each hidden item)

And I glued a single stick in place for Marble Track 3.  It is the
first stick that will be used as a support for the Outer Spiral.
