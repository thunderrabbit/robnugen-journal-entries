SOGO was cancelled today due to a typhoon (that was also apparently
cancelled).

I used the cancellation as an excuse not to go because I am supposed
to attend a presentation right after SOGO and need to be clean for it.

Well, I do not *need* to be clean, but I imagine I will fit in better
if my bare feet are not covered in mud.

Man, I shoulda gone to SOGO.

Instead, I got my budget caught up, oh, and I typed the long-ass
Japanese community news thing.  And took a nap.
