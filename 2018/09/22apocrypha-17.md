Saw Miyu briefly tonight at [Apocrypha #17, a trip to remember](https://www.meetup.com/Apocrypha/events/253866470/).  Met Sabrina who I thought was
courageous for the story she told about her family.  This was Isaac's
second event, and it went really well.  Yumi told a story about a
transformative experience she had, which sounded to me like it could
be a mixed gender version of Mankind Project.  Chelsea's story also
seemed courageous, regarding personal struggles while on vacation.
Oh, and Yuji's long story was worth it.  I could not have really cut
anything either.
