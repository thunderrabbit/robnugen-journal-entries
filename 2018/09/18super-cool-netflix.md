I got an email from Netflix saying they are going to raise prices
starting soon.  They did not list the options that were available, but
had some indication that I could change my plan or cancel if I
wanted.  I was not logged in to Netflix on my mobile phone so I left
the email in my inbox to deal with later.

Sat down to Netflix and chill today and a new dialog box popped up.
"Your price will go up to 1200 yen per month" and then two options:
Continue or Change Account (or something).

Clicked Change Account and then clicked down to basic (only 1 screen,
no HD) for 800 yen per month.  Bingo awesome UI and thank you Netflix.
