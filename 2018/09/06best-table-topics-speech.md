Today I won best Table Topics speech for making backronyms for JEBI,
the name of the typhoon that just blew through.

I am super bummed that I missed the obvious link to the word of the day, which was improvised
to be "improvise"

I started my speech "Given that I have just started a business that
has this acronym, I will be happy to tell you about Jumping
Entertainment Business Incorporated." and rambled on from there,
squeezing in another backronym for JEBI like Jelly Evaluation Bureau
of Investigations that can tell how high people jumped by how far they
sink into jelly.

My second draft would start the same, but " .. tell you about Jumping
Entertaining Business Improvisation, which allows us to improvise
business models based on entertaining jumpers.  Take the kangaroo, for
example. .."
