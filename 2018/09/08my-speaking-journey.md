I have been taking Soness's Step On The Red Dot course, part of
https://www.yourspeakingjourney.com/

Today was a normal marathon session of getting stuff done, plus lots
of witty anecdotes which I hope are helpful for everyone.

I had to bounce out of the Zoom session after 4.3 hours or so and
recorded my second Facebook Live video.
