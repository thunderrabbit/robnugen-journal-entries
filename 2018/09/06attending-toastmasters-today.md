Had a quick livestream today during which Reversible Guy (apparently)
glued a single toothpick and G Choppy cut two others which I had hoped
to glue but could not quite before I had to head out to Roppongi where
I am currently on Zoom with MKP men's circle before the Cisco
Toastmasters meeting from noon to 1pm.
