1. I just got home from
[Apocrypha #15](https://www.meetup.com/Apocrypha/events/249933126/)

## 09:13 Saturday 02 June 2018 JST

2. Was up too late last night and did not do much good for myself (porn), but
   I on the productive side I read some of MJG's new book
   [The Rot's War](https://www.amazon.com/Rots-War-Ignifer-Cycle-Book-ebook/dp/B07BCDRQDF)
   Ignifer Cycle Book 2
3. co-gender circle seems to have come back to meeting after a
   significant dip in attendance over winter holidays
4. men's circle has had pretty solid attendance, often with 7 men.  I
   might start tracking the *numbers* of attendees to see if there are
   any useful patterns

   medium marbles for Marble Track 3

6. Still have my MacBook Pro, like 4 or 5 years old now
7. Lin and I have lived in our house for 2 years yay
8. Jennie is good and has a cat door so she can come in and go out on
   her own schedule
9. I have been talking to Kristen via Marco Polo recently
10. I have not been talking to Richard via Marco Polo recently.
11. Just met T from AB to figure out the next priorities for the
    site.  Good meeting, and good to meet with them regularly.
12. I applied to "conduct" a symphony orchestra for some event at Muza
    on July 1st.  Will find out around 15 June if I got it.
13. Still have not made any more LINE stickers beyond the first two I
    made for Jennie, including "Jennie says what" which is no longer
    for sale (Lin did not like one of the pictures) and "Jennie says
    yeah"
14. Maybe I will make "Jennie says Tomoko" and have the name Tomoko
    written in various ways around Jennie posed in various ways.
15. Monday noon lessons at U in Nishi-Azabu are getting better; I seem
    to have found a good groove with the students.
16. dev on ConSwi for Godot has stalled in past couple of weeks. ugh.
17. Co-gender group meets on Mondays and men's circle meets on
    Tuesdays (since early 2018)
18. I have been studying on Thursday nights with Mel in Chicago for a while.
19. I have been teaching on Sunday nights with Sarumama near Shinjuku
    for a much longer while.
20. Last week I had a meeting with Michael in UK to talk about ways to create a
    program for corporate team building.
21. Been going to SOGO each Sunday, and Lin's friend Aki has started
    to come as well.  She has attended twice in past two weeks and
    seems keen to continue.
22. She asked Junyu how to get more physically fit; he talked for 15
    or so minutes in Japanese and I understood 80 or 90 percent.
23. I could probably say 5% or 10%
24. I have been using my waterproof Aquos phone for a while..  maybe 2
years
25. M$ is going to buy Github, which is good for the Github peeps I
    guess, but likely bad for open source.  I will move my junk off to
    something else.  Maybe.  Fred recently installed Gitlab on one of
    his servers.  Maybe I can use it.
26. Each Monday I have been chilling in Saizeria between Nishi-Azabu
    lesson and co-gender circle.  Time to head to co-gender circle soon.
