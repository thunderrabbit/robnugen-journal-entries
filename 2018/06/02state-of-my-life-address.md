2. Was up too late last night and did not do much good for myself (porn), but
   I on the productive side I read some of MJG's new book
   [The Rot's War](https://www.amazon.com/Rots-War-Ignifer-Cycle-Book-ebook/dp/B07BCDRQDF)
   Ignifer Cycle Book 2
3. co-gender circle seems to have come back to meeting after a
   significant dip in attendance over winter holidays
4. men's circle has had pretty solid attendance, often with 7 men.  I
   might start tracking the *numbers* of attendees to see if there are
   any useful patterns
