I did not keep careful track, but I believe we had 15 men in Tokyo
men's circle (Integration group) last night.  According to _A Circle
of Men_ we should think about splitting the group if the group is
larger than about 12 men.

I wonder about splitting the circle into two groups on the same
evenings, or possible begin a circle on another evening of the week.
