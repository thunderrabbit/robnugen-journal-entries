Been working too much recently, but not enough to trigger carpal
tunnel issues again, fortunately.

Today for AB I nearly finished a report that AB wants to have
available.  I thought I could finish in 2 hours, but it has taken 6.5
so far.  fack.  I will tell them it has taken longer.

Today for JB I did my normal Wednesday schedule (Solid Square with
Ayano and them, then two kid lessons and two adult lessons in JB
office from 15:30 - 21:00).  Had a gap in the middle so went to Muza
for their ワンコイン 500 yen lunchtime concert.  Had a nice snooze
during the performance, a string quartet, which played for about 40
minutes.
