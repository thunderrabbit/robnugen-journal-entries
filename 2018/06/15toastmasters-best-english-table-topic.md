Tonight I won the best (of three) English table topics.  Zero ums
counted by the um-counter, and 1 apparent use of the word "marvelous"
which I actually used as "marvel us"

The speech topic was anything, based on an item taken from a bag.  I
took out a piece of chocolate so did a sales pitch on it, basically
saying how its dimensions and mass could be used a measurment units.
