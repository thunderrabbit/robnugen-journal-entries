Now at JB wondering why I am watching this incremental game
([Clicking Bad](https://clickingbad.nullism.com/))instead of doing work
on AB.  In the game, I have 500M units of product, so I am thinking
about adding a whole new component to the game of buying warehouses,
which would be needed to keep up with the inventory else it could be
stolen, and perhaps increase the threat of raids.
