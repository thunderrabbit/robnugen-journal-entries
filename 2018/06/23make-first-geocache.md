I <del>plan to</del> place<ins>d</ins> my first geocache today.

I got support from
[Turbo-7](https://www.geocaching.com/p/default.aspx?guid=fdfa20d1-f3e5-4316-beb1-69d1cebbaa3f),
who sent me links to
[English](https://www.geocaching.com/play/hide/en-us/small-note) and
[Japanese](https://www.geocaching.com/play/hide/ja-jp/small-note)
notes to place on the cache.

I tweaked the notes to include my email address, but have not put them
online yet because they break the CSS of my site when displayed in the
index, and I cannot figure out how to override the Hugo index the way
I want.

<del>I plan to create a (repo with a) page for (each of) my geocache(s),
and am working on that now.

I plan for it to be available at https://robnugen.com/geocaching/xxxx
where xxxx is the code given to me by Geocaching website once I place
the cache.  For now, my domain is prefixed with new, so it will likely
be at https://new.robnugen.com/geocaching/ and then the code.</del>
