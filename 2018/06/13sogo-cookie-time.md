This past weekend after SOGO (only like 12 people attended because it
was sprinkling for part of the time) we went to Cookie Time, and oh my
god I can imagine how bad it is for me because of how good they
taste.  I will probably go back next week, esp if Aki comes to SOGO;
she also loves sweets.

I ate mine before most people even started theirs; I hadn't heard we
were going to wait for a compai and picture haha.  Some people could
not finish theirs so I helped them out.  Man I must be a sugar junkie.

Hung out in the park afterward, chatting and drawing designs in the
pine needles.  Ended up leaving after a solid hour because the rain
began in earnest.  Walked back to Cookie Time to get my umbrella,
which was helpful to have once I got back to Shin Yurigaoka.
