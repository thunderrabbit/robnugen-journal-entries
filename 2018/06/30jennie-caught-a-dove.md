Jennie caught a dove soon after I let her outside at 4am this
morning.  Fortunately it was uninjured.  After kicking her out of the
room, and slow chasing it around the room for a bit, I got the idea to
drop a cotton T-shirt on the bird.  He chilled out and then actually
did not instantly fly away when he was able to.

He stood on the balcony for about half a minute (30 seconds, not half
of one of these newly defined minutes) and then flew away.

I'm really happy he could fly.
