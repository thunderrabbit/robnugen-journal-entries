よいしょ is the audio I want to add right at the end of this video.
In this case, it is the equivalent of "3. 2. 1. lift!"

Spoonhead is adept at getting the marbles onto the stage because he's
the right height for that.  I gave him long arms as well to help lift
marbles (and knock the switch around accidentally).

Speaking of accidents, while trying to film the frame after they
lifted the marble, it fell and knocked everything askew.
