I keep getting spammed by people looking for backlinks.

I linked to Trello because it is a service I liked at the time.  Plus,
that was back in 2013; robnugen.com/journal is a web journal, not a
web site, so I am not going to go back and update old content.  That
shit is pristine just as it was written.

Plus, crying can be good.

I dug around on the guy's site and found a lot of clickbaity titles,
but maybe that is what it takes to make a buck around here.
