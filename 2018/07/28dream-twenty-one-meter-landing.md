<p class="dream">
There's an approach to Dallas airport over a mountain, where we fly through a mountain pass, over a ridge, right around an outcropping of rock, and then into a cave which serves as the runway.
</p>

<p class="dream">
This was my forth time to arrive on this runway, and the big screen window in front gives everyone a great view of the approach in real-time.  As usual, everyone shares the same awestruck feelings, ranging from "we are all going to die" to "wow that's amazing", but that's only from what we can see through the window.
</p>

<p class="dream">
This time, I noticed something orders of magnitude more amazing than any other time I have arrived at this airport.  As the plane flew into the cave, we didn't touch down immediately like most times.  This time the pilot slowed us down so once we actually landed, we rolled only 21 meters after wheels contacted the ground.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I pointed out to some of the other passengers who were all duly impressed with the visible parts of the landing, because I was sitting where I could see the tachometer, and how it didn't start counting until we were nearly stopped.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I stepped down off the platform and walked to where the pilots were gathering their bags and talking together.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I shouted "Captain Solo!" to get their attention with a comparison to Han Solo (and his flight skills) because I heard many passengers make the same comparison while witnessing the landing.
</p>

<p class="dream">
They looked up, and I was like "Captain, I have arrived at this airport several times, and it's always amazing, but this time I noticed how we only rolled twenty one meters after touchdown.  I'm so impressed I just had to say thank you."
</p>

<p class="dream">
The older Captain nodded with humble thanks and the younger said "be sure to prepare a present," so I immediately handed over my phone which was open on the back screen to a video clip of us standing dangerously close to the edge of the very same outcropping of rock around which we have to fly during this approach.
</p>

<p class="dream">
They smiled and said like wow nice picture how did you get that? And though it was actually a selfie, I realized it might be in an illegal location, so I was like "oh I just found it online.." and he handed the phone back, saying thanks for showing me; I hadn't seen it before.
</p>

And I woke up.
