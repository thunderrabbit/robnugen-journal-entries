Driving to Niigata is taking ages because of the speed limit and
stuff, but we are having fun with Mikako in the car with us as Lin
drives.  I have never gotten a driver's license in Japan, but it is
long trips like this that kinda make me want to have one.  Highway
driving is no problem for me.  It's just the squirmy little streets
near our house that I don't want to navigate in a car (especially not
a relatively big ass mini van like we have).

Mikako brought her dog Kodama "little ball" who has been quite quiet,
far surpassing my expectations when I heard she would be joining us.
She has uttered nary a bark nor moved from her designated pad on the
seat.
