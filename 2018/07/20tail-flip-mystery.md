In this livestream, I added 1 second of video to the 6th snippet.

In the background, the reversible guy has just gotten the bridge cut
and is about to place it when he (and I, ahem) realized it was flipped
around the wrong way.

In the foreground, the snake began climbing up the ramp to the triple
ball splitter while the manager tries to work out how to get the small
ball to fall at the right place.
