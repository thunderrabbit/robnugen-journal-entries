Last night we discussed presenting a day-long workshop to men in Tokyo.  My vision is to expand the work to new men around Tokyo and eventually Japan.  I am looking for 2 or 3 men to help me present the workshop in October or November this year.  I hope to meet with whoever steps up and create a plan by early August.

Today Tomoko seemed quite entertained with the magnitude of Marble
Track 3's Construction.  It worked well to show her
[Marble Track 2](http://mt2.robnugen.com/) because she soon asked how
I made it.

Nowadays at JB, I teach 5 lessons on Wednesdays, 20% more than the
past year of lessons.

I think I finished adding ARC Cycles to CSV reports for AB.  I mean I
finished, and I think they are what AB wanted.

I think my passport expires soon; I gotta get that sorted.  Because no
one checks my passport unless I leave the country, I figured I can let
it be expired for a while, but now I realize that may not be a good
idea.

Our 6pm students seem to be late.  It's after 5:59 now.  Not late!  16
seconds to spare.
