Tonight I chose to work on my anger related to things not going my
way.

Anger: why is this person standing blocking the escalator keeping
people from going up?

Anger: why would R-san not trust a professional wine taster that he
knows how to taste wine without getting drunk?

Anger: why would A-san suggest popcorn style for people to speak up
instead of just asking each person?

Following the anger back, I came upon a scene in the game room back in
the house where we lived until I was 7 years old.  We had some
[slot cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_car_racing) that my dad
showed me how to put oil on the cars to make them go faster.  I put
oil on them and basically clogged up the motors so they hardly ran at
all.

My dad was so mad at me.  He's the one who fuckin' showed me how to
add oil to them!!

In my mind, I went back to the scene to just sit with myself-at-age-7
and be with him.  Daddy was at work; mommy was at work.  He was alone
playing with the cars, likely trying to show his brother or the
neighbor kids how to make the cars faster.

In my mind, I went to bat for 7-year-old-me when my dad came home.
"Well, you showed him how to do it, and he did it.  It's gonna be
okay."

I allowed 7-year-old-me to come live in my heart and everything be
okay.

I withdrew the projection that A-san doing popcorn style is
imperfect.  It's going to be okay.

I withdrew my projection that R-san should assume pro-san knows what
he is doing.  Maybe he doesn't.

I withdrew the projection that escalator-san was doing anything wrong
by standing there.  Maybe they are keeping back a few seconds so I
won't get hit by a car later.
