I am trying to use [castanet](https://github.com/mattstratton/castanet/) but cannot get it to show blog
entries.

I guess I should more carefully read the [docs for castanet](https://github.com/mattstratton/castanet/blob/master/REFERENCE.md).

One problem was having tags listed not in quotes.   I had to change
this

    tags: mt3

to this

    tags: [ "mt3" ]
