1. Dreamhost has decided to stop supporting catch-all emails so I am
   looking for a new provider.  The encrypted versions cannot search
   nor test for spam very well so I may not be happy with any of those
2. I am too tired to write this right now so I should go to bed.
3. For AB, I have started adding arc_cycles, which should save them a
   decent amount of time when creating historical reports.
4. I got a haibiscus for Lin "today"

5. I got my MX records set to a new provider (Google, and GSuite, with a bit of conflict that it is less secure, but I want my catch-all and so far so good with Google)
6. I checked out https://dayboard.co/ for a couple days, but it has some bugs so am going to skip it for now.
7. I am watching video 82 or so in this [hypnotherapy course](https://www.udemy.com/hypnotherapy-certification-online-course-hypnosis-practitioner-nlp/)
8. Later this month I will meet Eri to go through the Passion Test recommended by Jens.
9. I work at SSC every week now and sometimes twice a week.
10. I have started again reading [The Seven Laws of Money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/377607.The_Seven_Laws_Of_Money) and restarted tracking all my monies.
11. Lin just got home. (18:42)
12. Going to go get pizza (19:15)
13. Just got back from buying pizza (20:00)
14. Just got back upstairs after eating and sitting on the couch (21:12)
