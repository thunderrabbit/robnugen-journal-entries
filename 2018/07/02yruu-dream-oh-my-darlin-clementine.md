It's been a while since I woke up with a YRUU dream in my mind.

<p class="dream">
We were somewhere and someone sang some made up lyrics
There was a new  attendee from Colorado, and we jokingly said we had
not heard of their football team, the California Nuggets.  As an
apology, someone sang
</p>

<p class="dream">
Oh my darling, oh my darling<br>
Oh my darling, Clementine<br>
We don't know the football team name<br>
but we remember you just fine.<br>
</p>

<p class="dream">
And everyone cheered.  I proposed we do an impromptu talent show with
a continuous stream of such made up lyrics.
</p>

<p class="dream">
We went down to the stage, but it was roped off for cleaning. I asked
the person if we could use it, but was denied.  We would have to come
back in 30 minutes.  So we all lined up and started a freestyle dance
while in line when 
</p>
my alarm woke me up.
