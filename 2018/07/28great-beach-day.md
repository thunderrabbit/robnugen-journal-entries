We got to the beach around 10am and it was warm; by the time we left
around 2pm it was hotter than I could stand to walk barefoot on the
sand.

We ate at a vegetarian buffet https://yoganiigata.jp/ Good for
1600 yen per person.

We went to see Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom last night which was
pretty good for a fifth installment of a series.
