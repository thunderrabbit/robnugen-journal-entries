<p class="dream">While on campus at a university I needed to use the
restroom to go number 2, but all the restrooms had lines.  From
experience, I knew that the restrooms on higher floors had shorter
lines, but I had to go up to a floor I had never previously seen.</p>

<p class="dream">I got to some kind  of room with a lectern and chairs
and wanted to  see what was on  the next floor, but it  was locked.  I
could see under the door tht  someone was there, but it was apparently
a private floor.  I went around a corner and found a pair of restrooms
that were adjacent with no wall between them, and realized there was a
mirror between them so they each looked like larger rooms.</p>

<p class="dream">I chose the one with had a symbol for men on the
door, and just my luck, there was a giant turd floating in the water.
I flushed the ancient handle, but the water just went higher and the
turd was that much closer to overflow.  I tried again with more vigor
and noticed the water did go down, but only after holding the handle
down for a while.  So I held the handle and got the water down to a
manageble level and sat down to do my business.</p>

<p class="dream">The door to the next restroom opened, and lo, it was
not a mirror, but a simple shower curtain between the loos.  The woman
who came in was like, actually this toilet is for number 2 and that
one is for number 1 only.  I nodded my head politely, and she asked if
I knew what she meant.</p>

<p class="dream">"Yes, this is for number 1," holding up 1 finger,
"and that is for number 2," holding up 2 fingers as if that proved
anything.  After a moment, I explained that I used the restroom which
had the symbol for men on it.</p>

<p class="dream">She was like, "yeah that means number 1 only."</p>

<p class="dream">I said "hmm yeah well that makes sense" and I thought
about it for a while and realized "oh, but I know how to control this
toilet now. You guys designated this for pee only because sometimes
the water only rises. Not to mention, there was a giant turd in this
toilet when I came in, and I cleaned it up, so you are welcome."</p>

<p class="dream">She perked up to hear that.  "Really?  Because that
would be great," and gave me a kiss.</p>

Then I woke up.
