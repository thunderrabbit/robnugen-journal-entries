Working on MT3 today I had a funny idea. There were two marbles ready
to roll off the track and I realized it would be great for the
spoonhead guy to catch them.  So I had to erase eight frames, but they
were not too hard to recreate, and the end result is great.

The frames are shown in the last second of the video above.

Next I'll have the manager decide what to do about the orange ball not
working correctly, as that side of the stage will be in front of the
camera soon.

Eventually, too much time will be spent moving the marbles up to the
top of the track.  I need to make a teleportation thing to move marbles
around.  It would just about require having half marbles so one can go
halfway into the thing on both sides.

I was going to write the totals, but for some reason, pages 2 and 3 of
my videos on Youtube say there are no videos.  Pages 4 and beyond are
okay...
