SUBJECT: Unauthorized charges on my credit card

Hello

My name is Rob Nugen, and I am writing to ask you to remove unauthorized charges from my credit card.

My credit card number is (REDACTED)

On or around April 15, 2018, I used my credit card to do age verification for http://free-adult-games.com/  The website URL and name both indicate the content is free.  I read the content written around the credit card entry form and felt assured my card would not be charged.  Otherwise, I would not have signed up because there is plenty of free pornography available online.

On or around May 28th 2018, I received my credit card statement which showed three different charges (even though I only entered my credit card number one time).

1. 4/17 wirescredcomp.com (866) 412-377 for $39.95
2. 4/20 quotekrewbill.com (866) 324-828 for $39.94
3. 4/24 payzonebill.com (877) 253-895 for $49.95

I chatted with a friendly customer service agent who assured me all the charges would be removed from my credit card.

I have a copy of the transcript here:
https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/05/29/cancelled-porn-charges/

This month, I have received the same set of three charges.

1. 5/16 wirescredcomp.com (866) 412-377 for $39.95
2. 5/20 quotekrewbill.com (866) 324-828 for $39.94
3. 5/24 payzonebill.com 866 401-9676 for $49.95

I called customer service this time, and was assured they "could only remove 2 charges" which is insufficient given there were *more* than 2 charges *each month*, even though I had only entered my credit card number one time, on one site.

I ran out of credit while on the phone so was disconnected while on hold.  I went back to customer service chat.

I have a copy of the transcipt here:
https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/07/03/note-to-self-do-not-sign-up-for-porn/

The agent made the same assurances that all the charges have been removed.  I asked how I can trust they have been removed after I was given the same assurances last month.  The agent suggested I write to you.

The charges listed above were not authorized.
Please remove all the charges listed above and any other similar charges from my credit card number ________________.

Sincerely,
Rob Nugen
