* Marble Track 3 has its own domain, https://www.marbletrack3.com/
  hosted as a static site on Netlify
* ConSwi is open source under GNU copyleft.  Several outstanding issues,
the biggest of which are
[#25 disallow dragged pieces to go through other pieces](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/25)
and
[#23 Make piece keep up with mouse when dragging](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/23)
* I created a
  [Patreon page for MT3](https://www.patreon.com/marbletrack3) and
  have my first patron, Jimmy!
* I recently got the fans and battery replaced on my MacBook, but it
  still conks out when the battery is at 65%.  I let it run all the
  way down to 0 after charging all the way, and did cmd-shift-p-r on
  boot.
* I have not been writing journal entries very consistently recently
* Working on AB, trying to get the code base for both sites up to
snuff with MLAPHP
* Working on TY, trying to get the new students up to speed
* Marble Track 3 has six (6) different supports for the outer spiral,
  and they each have webpages on the website, with shortlinks so I can
  refer to them easily enough https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/1poss -
  https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/6poss  The /p/ stands for "parts" as
  in "parts of the track" and Nposs stands for the Nth Placed Outer
  Spiral Support.
* C and E have their wedding party soon (this coming Thursday)
* Lin and I had a date tonight, eating ramen at a local cheap ramen
  shop.  They deal with money by having a vending machine that
  dispenses colored plastic cards which tell what we ordered.  The
  cards are as thick as poker chips, but round-rectangular
* Jennie is our cat.  She goes in and out through her cat door on the
  2nd floor, which leads to the balcony and her little cat stair-bench
  to the roof, to the tree, to the ground (and back).
* The Marble Track 3 site is on version 2 now, which focuses on the
  characters making the site instead of on me making the site.  I
  think it is more interesting this way, but it still needs a tweak
  before I am like "yep".  The top page isn't right yet..  Currently
  shows my inspiration for starting the project, but should show
  *their* inspiration (or something), but I do not yet know what that
  is.
* Lucifer is in its 3rd season, so I have started watching it on Netflix, so far
  not bingeing.
* I plan to binge the hell out of Rick and Morty seasons 3 - 99 when
  they are available.
* My primary non-static web provider said my wiki dedicated to Castle
  of Dreams was using too much memory.  I need to convert it to a
  static site and let people edit it via git.  Fack when will I ever
  make time for that?
* Been talking to Dora about getting business started.  She introduced
  me to [Dan Pe√±a's site](https://www.danpena.co.uk/) and it's like damn.
* Speaking of castles, how is it that we live like royalty did back in the
  day, but compared to back in the day, we still are like slaves?
