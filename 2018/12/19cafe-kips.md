For over a year, I have had gaps in my schedule on Wednesdays between
teaching at Solid Square in Kawasaki and teaching at JB in Kawsaki.
Usually I bring my computer and work in a cafe, but today is the
second time I have worked in an *internet* cafe, which features my own
private space with a padded floor for sleeping, free wifi, free
shower, free drinks, and *free ice cream*.

Granted, it is soft serve ice cream, but it's nice that I have the
option to actually lay down for a snooze.

I had searched for a private workspace a couple times, then Lin
suggested a cafe a few weeks ago.  nice.  こんど we will hang out here
together, where the joke is "こんど means never" though is literally
"next time"
