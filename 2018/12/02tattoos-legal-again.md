    In 2017, Masuda Futoshi was fined 150,000 yen for tattooing customers
    without a medical license.
    
    Recently, the Japanese high court reversed the decision.
    
    Tattoos have historical and artistic significance.  Tattoos are social
    customs in modern society.  Therefore the court decided ”tattoos are
    fundamentally different from medical work.”
    
    Tattoos have traditionally been an art form for many years.  The
    decision to call them medical treatment is hard to defend.
    
    The debate is not over.  Yasuhiro Tanabe, the prosecutor said, "we
    will respond appropriately after studying the judgment."
