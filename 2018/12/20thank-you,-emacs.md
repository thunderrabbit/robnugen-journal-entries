Super nice: I was able to figure out how to create a function to
simplify the creation of web pages for Marble Track 3
Parts](https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/).  Now I just type `C-c p`
in Emacs, then enter the title, tags, and shortcode to produce a file
for a new Part in the Marble Track 3 website.

Today, with said shortcode, I started the page for
[Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter](/p/mcbts).
