Yikes I derped and did not do my task for TY.  First time, but I will
definitely not miss again.

JB classes were fun; we used fake money notes as money in the 4:30pm kids
class (Suzu, Kanta, Toshiro), and then I used them again in 8pm adult
class (Misato, Kaori).

Working on ConSwi now, refactoring to make pieces move themselves
down, and get a ton of code out of the main
[Game.gd](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/blob/3570d9f2db82e61aa5de38da18c850f4463d756f/Game.gd).
