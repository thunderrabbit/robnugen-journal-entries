Though I have not figured out how to present it, I want to have some
pages that give a complete rundown of how the workers have made Marble
Track 3.

At this point, under /snippets, it starts like this:

```
Squarehead leads Rabby onto the set as Rabby drags a round
circular plate behind him.

Squarehead unties the ropes from Rabby. Rabby squishes Squarehead as
he heads toward the camera, knocking it off its stand.

By the time the camera is reset, Squarehead has recovered and is
pulling the ropes out from under the wooden circle.

Lil brother comes onto the set, and wonders if heâ€™s allowed to step on
the stage. He sees his mom, and thinks better of it. Other characters
pay the stage no mind and walk all across it.

Once the characters have arrived and greeted each other, Dr Sugar
comes in and thanks everyone for being there.

Mr McGlue comes in late, and big brother tells Lil brother to wait his
turn. Big brother punches Lil brother and runs away.

Then everyone except Candy Mama and Dr Sugar run away as spooky
skeleton Garinoppi comes onto the set. Lil Brother inexplicably floats
up into the air.
```

I want the moments to be linked to specific timestamps in specific
videos online (currently, Youtube).  I also want photos of the
moments, embedded in the text.

I think the best way to do this will be with a data document that Hugo
can parse.  I will have to maintain the data file by hand for the
foreseeable future; I don't know of any other way to get the data.
