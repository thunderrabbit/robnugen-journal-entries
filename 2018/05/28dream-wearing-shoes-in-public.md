<p class="dream">Walking outside, I realized I was wearing hiking
boots and was shocked that I was wearing them while walking around on
vacation.  I asked store owner if I could have a bag to put them in,
but he said he could not give me one, but I could not understand the
reason why.  I walked further and found a place to put my boots in a
locker so I did that and saw Yumi there who taking things out of her
locker and she said I could put my shoes with her stuff with kinda the
implication that her son would be able to wear them when he got older.
That's fine with me and I was glad to be barefoot again, but I
wondered if I would really never need them in the next 15 years; I do
wear them in winter sometimes!</p>
