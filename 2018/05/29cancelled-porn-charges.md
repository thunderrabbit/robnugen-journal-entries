18:47 <font color="red">KHD-Allen V.:</font> Please allow me to explain that... The free lifetime membership comes with a 2-day trial  Preimer Passport Site.  Since the Preimer Passport Site remained active passed the trial period, the subscription automatically converted to a full month membership.  That is the reason why you were billed<br>

18:47 <font color="blue">Rob Nugen:</font> That makes sense.<br>
18:47 <font color="red">KHD-Allen V.:</font> Sir/Ma'am... if you want I can cancel the subscription to stop the recurring charges.  Would you like me to do that for you?<br>
18:48 <font color="blue">Rob Nugen:</font> However, I have not used the site after the first time, so would like to cancel the account<br>
18:48 <font color="blue">Rob Nugen:</font> I would be much obliged if you could remove the charges as well.<br>
