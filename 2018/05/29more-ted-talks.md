* What elements do you think make this a “quintessential” talk?

Not sure what you mean by the talk being quintessential; I think it's
inspired and probably true, but it is not *better* than other talks on TED.

* What’s your opinion on this talk?

Great to see a "famous" artist be humble and real about her fears and
modeling how she intends to continue doing her work because it's her work.

* How would you summarize this talk in a sentence?

I take care of the quantity, God takes care of the quality.

* Why do you think this idea was chosen as an idea worth spreading?

We need more creative solutions in the world.

* Had you seen this talk before? If so, what effect has it had on you?

Keep on swimming.

* What action can you take after watching this talk?

Be glad I am doing my creative work as well.
