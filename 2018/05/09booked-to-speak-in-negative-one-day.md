I am not sure how all this works, but I plan to join
[Soness](https://soness.com/)'s
[Get Booked to Speak in a Week](https://courses.yourspeakingjourney.com/)
class starting tomorrow.  So that means between tomorrow and the week
after, I should get booked to speak.  Does it count if I get booked
today, before the class starts?

It's not really a *speaking* engagement, but come on out to Bar
GariGari on June 1st for [story telling night](https://www.meetup.com/Apocrypha/events/249933126/)
