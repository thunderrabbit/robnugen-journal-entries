Walked with Lin to the "bread festival" near our station.  It was
basically ten tables with some pastries / cookies, most of which were
individually wrapped; none of which seemed different than what I could
buy in a convenience store.

I took another pic of ..  hmm maybe I can make a page for these on my
<del>journal</del> <ins>site</ins>.

or maybe a whole set of pages ... (brain starts to run wild..)

Okay first things first: I will

1. <del>download the images</del>
2. <del>upload the images to my image server</del>
3. <del>put all of them on a new page</del>
4. <del>figure out what to call the set of images</del>

But first first I will finish this entry.

After being unimpressed with the パン祭り, we walked a long way home
to look for some geocaches.

But first we had lunch in a park.

After lunch and sending some MarcoPolos to Karina, we went looking for
geocaches.  We got really really close to two of them but were unable
to find them.  The first one had been found recently.

I also DNF [Mujinagaike park](https://coord.info/GC2KDWJ), but did not log it
because I didn't look allll that very long.  I did find a turtle,
though.  I couldn't determine if the turtle was alive without
disturbing it, so I left it alone.

On the way home, Lin's sandals were chafing her feet so she went
barefoot for a bit.  Maybe 45 seconds until she stepped on a tiny
little rock.

Turns out the first cache was missing.  [Turbo-7 replaced it this morning](https://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?LUID=495be967-d9af-46df-ad40-562ac001d4fa).
