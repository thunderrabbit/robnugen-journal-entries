The Greatest Showman starring Hugh Jackman seemed <del>reasonably realistic</del>
for a musical.  I cried twice, but not at the end.  It seems Jenny
Lind was portrayed more poorly than Wikipedia says, but is it supposed
to make the movie better?  I was like, "htfd she think he was trying
to get with her?"

But like I said, it's a musical, but apparently not as realistic as I
hoped.  Nice story of spirit, love, and friendship.
