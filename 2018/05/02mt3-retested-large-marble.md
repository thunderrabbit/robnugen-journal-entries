Yesterday I glued a piece onto the track which was designed to catch
small marbles as they fall through the not parallel bamboo
chopstick marble splitter.

Now it's time to see if it worked!

Woohoooo it worked!!

Uh oh.

After I tested the fix today, while setting up for the next frame, I
noticed the large marbles could not roll past the piece.

oops

I debated cutting the piece, but decided to reglue it, even though
that will mean "wasting" a day of filming, but realistically only an
hour because Lin and I are scheduled to leave at 10.  Ahem, were
scheduled to leave at 10.

Anyway, I am really happy that I decided to reglue the piece.  It
allowed me to take photos of the large marble racing off the second
curve.
