I got a weird bump on my leg.  Doctor gave some antibiotics.

Today is my first health update my journal.  I'm actually writing via
voice recognition because I am not supposed to use my left wrist right
now.

I went to the clinic and the doctor took x-rays and said there is some
calcification on the bones in my wrist.  Here are some pictures.

Last night Yuji looked at my wrist at Shake Shack, He said he thinks
my good posture with my back and shoulders this actually hurting my
wrist, Which ends up taking all the stress.  He also said it seems
like the [joint between my radius and ulna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_radioulnar_articulation) is not as strong as most
people.

He gave me some exercises to help strengthen the joint and kind of
get it back into the right position.
