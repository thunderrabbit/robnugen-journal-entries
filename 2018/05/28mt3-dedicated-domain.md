    HI Jackie!
    
    I would like to make a site for my ongoing project, Marble Track 3.
    
    I need some help kinda imagining how is best to present the
    info+content I have, plus I have a few ideas+constraints of how I
    think it should go.
    
    I think the site can be implemented as a static website with no
    backend coding required.  (Except *possibly* for a section
    inviting people to get involved with the project.)
    
    I need help with design and CSS.
    
    For my current site at https://new.robnugen.com/ I am using Hugo
    (https://gohugo.io/) to create the site based on a theme and a
    bunch of markdown files for content.
    
    For the new site, I would like to use my existing markdown files
    for the BLOG portion of the site.
    
    Here is an example BLOG source file
    https://bitbucket.org/thunderrabbit/robnugen-journal-entries/raw/master/2018/05/02mt3-retested-large-marble.md
    
    From this, Hugo creates
    https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/05/02/mt3-retested-large-marble/
    
    I want to keep using the same markdown + YAML format so I do not
    have to disrupt my current workflow too much.
    
    Let me know if your eyes have not glazed over and I can tell you
    more of what I am thinking.
    
    (reminder to self: BLOG, ABOUT, SUPPORT, SNIPPETS, COMMUNITY )
    
    love and light
    - Rob
