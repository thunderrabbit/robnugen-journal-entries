So thankful for my group tonight who were able to help me look at my
income problem, pick me up out of the proverbial quicksand, and open
me up to no limits for my business plan.

Not that I actually knew I was in proverbial quicksand, nor that I had
unconsciously put limits on my possible business.  Great to have great
feedback from them.
