We are nearly finished with Season 1.  Tonight we watched Season 1
Episode 10 (on Netflix).  I paused it a few times to make sure she was
catching all the important bits and better jokes, and she understood
some of them, so yay.  ((( At this point, the first three seasons have
been released, and I have seen all the episodes a few times each. )))
