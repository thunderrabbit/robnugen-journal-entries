Lin and I went to
[Giwado in Kanda](https://www.facebook.com/pg/giwado.kanda/about/), a
foot massage shop I like, and got 45 minute foot massages!  Ate lunch
with Charu after that and then headed back home because we were tired
and the weather planned to rain.

Ate ice cream at BR31 after I found my third geocache,
[the geocache in 新百合ヶ丘駅](https://coord.info/GC42QJA).

Lin joined me to find my fourth, but
[we could not find it](https://coord.info/GC3EV6D).
