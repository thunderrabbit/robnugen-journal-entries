[Malcom](https://complice.co/about-the-team) from [Complice](https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu) wrote the following:

> This is a thing that probably warrants an article being written about
it! It took me awhile to get to this, but I have now written TWO
articles! One is published, and the other one (which is a more direct
reply to you) is not yet. But here it is:

> This is a natural cycle. What you're encountering is a form of
staleness. Complice is in general designed to combat staleness, for
instance by not allowing you to enter a bunch of tasks that you're not
actually going to do today. However, staleness can still show up in a
few ways. The dailies and notdones features were ones that I knew
would introduce sources of staleness into the system, so I did my best
to counter-optimize for that. I think I did a reasonably good job, but
it's not perfect yet.

> The WorkFlowy integration... needs major work. Having established that, there are two levels to it:

> 1. What can you do differently? (since you're asking)
> 2. What can Complice do differently? (since most Complice users won't read this article)

> **What can you do differently?**

> It sounds to me like you want to fix your belt problem using
something other than a reminder in your task list. I wrote an article
called
[How to send perfectly-timed physical messages to your future self](https://blog.complice.co/post/111442313267/how-to-send-perfectly-timed-physical-messages-to)
which would advocate for a strategy something like "when you take your
belt off, put it on top of something that you'll pick up tomorrow
after you have your pants on" and then obviously when you go to pick
up that something, you'll first need to pick up your belt, at which
point you put your belt on.

> This is a specific example, but the general principle is that doing
your desired behavior automatically is better than doing it by
reminder. And if you do have to use a reminder, the best kind is one
that leaves no ambiguity about whether or not now is the moment. So
for "do not eat after 9pm", maybe what you want is something that will
make your phone buzz once at 8:30pm, to remind you that it's your last
chance to eat today, and something to make your phone buzz at 9pm,
indicating that eating is now over for the day.

> Another even-more-general principle is: **if something isn't working,
stop doing it**. If the Complice "do not eat after 9pm" intention
isn't reminding you to stop eating after 9pm, then find something
else. You might still keep the intention around if you want to *track*
which days you were successful at this, but it's clearly failing as a
reminder.

> **Triaging staleness**

> While writing this post, I ended up writing so much under dealing
with staleness that I decided to make it its own post:
[Making sense of a single stale task](https://blog.complice.co/post/173836925777/making-sense-of-a-single-stale-task)
The basic gist is that it could be because the thing actually doesn't
matter, or it could be because you're conflicted about it. If the
thing doesn't matter, don't do it! If you're conflicted, either fix
the task until you're not conflicted, or find a way to get back in
touch with why the task matters so that rather than forcing yourself
to do it (and resisting being forced) you're naturally drawn to it
based on your sense of purpose.

> **What can Complice do differently?**

> Well, one thing would be if Complice could detect when people might be
in situations like yours, and encourage them to reflect a bit like
this post is doing.

> Another piece is that it's currently hard to stop stale WorkFlowy
things that are getting pulled into Complice, from within the Complice
UI. My workflow for this looks like "copy the node id from my
intentions textbox, open up a WorkFlowy tab, replace the node id in
that tab with the one from my intentions, then delete/complete/untag
that node." Even though that only takes 10-20 seconds, it's still way
too cumbersome.

> Regarding reflecting when things go stale, Complice could notice when
you have an intention N days in a row and it doesn't get done, and
prompt you to think about it a bit more. The notdone propagator
currently does this with one-off intentions, but there's still a major
issue here with repeating tasks either from the built-in dailies or
from WorkFlowy.
