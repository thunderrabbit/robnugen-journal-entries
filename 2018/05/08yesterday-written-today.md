## Tuesday 08 May 2018 JST

(written 10:21 Wednesday 09 May 2018 JST)

I spent a bit over an hour on MT3 yesterday. At least half of that
time was spent thinking about what each character should do next.

I did not finish all my Complice stuff; I think I have overloaded it
with too many tasks each day.

Great Tokyo men's circle last night, despite the rain.  The new man
from last week attended again and had great insights on the problem I
presented to the circle.

I read several pages of Planet on Purpose, which inspired me to be a
more transparent leader in the circle, specifically, admitting when I
wasn't able to complete a task I had set for myself.
