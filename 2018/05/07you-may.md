今朝４時ごろ長く見て夢が終わった。 This morning I had a long dream which finished at 4am.

今朝長く夢を見て４時ごろ起きた。 This morning I woke up from a long dream at 4am.

<p class="dream">At an amusement park, Fred, Lin, and I were on a circular ride which
of red metal bars connected with in a flexible way and each joint
covered with leather.  I intended to ride leaning way back like this,
but when the ride started, there was really not enough room to lean
back.  I was actually leaning forward to keep from hitting the walls
outside the ride.  The seats kept spiraling in and out and I said HI,
or excuse me to greet each person my seat came near.  One guy on some
of the inner parts was down on the ground with fake money and we
started rolling through a lot of memes together like making puns,
wearing sunglasses, then screaming yeahhh, or get over it, or you the
real mvp, etc.  Then my seat went impossibly outside a column, and
then outside into the larger park where Lin was there walking around
as she had already noped off the ride. I learned how to drive it
around the park so we rode together for a bit. until I woke up.</p>
