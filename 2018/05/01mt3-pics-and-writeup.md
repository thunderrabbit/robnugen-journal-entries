Great progress on MT3 today.  I shaved the bottom of the marble
splitter chopsticks so the small marble could pass under them.  I made
a bit of a continuity mistake though by actually lifting one of the
chopsticks a bit (instead of just shaving the bottom of it).

These are pics from before the shave:
