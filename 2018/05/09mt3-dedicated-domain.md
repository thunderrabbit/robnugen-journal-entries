    Hey Nathan
    
    I am making a marble track, a.k.a. rolling ball track, similar to this
    one I made several years ago, visible here https://mt2.robnugen.com/
    
    This time, however, I am not just making the track, I am also making a
    stop action animation of some characters making the track.  Clips of
    the video so far are here https://mt3s.robnugen.com in a playlist.
    (No audio nor background yet; that is a whole other project (I asked
    you about Blender before))
    
    The project is about 5% finished, and has taken a year to get this
    far.  I don't have many followers yet, but I would like to have a
    domain dedicated to the site while I build and document the whole
    thing.
    
    So basically, I want to make a site for the content visible here
    https://mt3.robnugen.com/, but with branding specific to Marble Track
    3, not Thunder Rabbit.
    
    I think I "just" need a Hugo theme; I am using Hugo (static site
    generator) to make the current site, including blog, photos, and
    embedded Youtube videos.  I write pages in markdown format, using YAML
    format for the frontmatter(1) (meta data: title, date, tags)
    
    From this example source file
    https://bitbucket.org/thunderrabbit/robnugen-journal-entries/raw/master/2018/05/02mt3-retested-large-marble.md
    
    Hugo creates
    https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/05/02/mt3-retested-large-marble/
    
    I want to keep using that markdown + YAML format so I do not have to
    disrupt my current workflow too much.
    
    Here is my current theme https://github.com/thunderrabbit/purehugo-tr
    
    How do we go about pricing such a thing?  I would be happy to include
    a link to your site as designer.
    
       See you soon!
       - Rob
