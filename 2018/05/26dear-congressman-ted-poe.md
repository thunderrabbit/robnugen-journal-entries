Please support Net Neutrality.  Otherwise, you are going to have to pay to get your message out to constituents.

In short, I want you and all your fellow member of congress to vote the opposite of whatever Ajit Pai suggests.  As you can see on the ArsTechnica(1) website, Pai's so-called "light-touch approach" of the previous 20 years actually consisted of much heavier regulation than exists today.

I personally have multiple websites that are free for users to read.  I cannot afford to pay higher rates to allow my sites to compete with the likes of Amazon, Facebook, Google, or other well-established firms.

We entrust you with the ability to vote on many topics, most of which I do not understand, nor care to understand.  However, in this case, I understand quite well, and hope you will vote with 75% of Americans wishes (2).  I know not *all* Americans are your constituents, but I cannot find a survey that polls just this district.
