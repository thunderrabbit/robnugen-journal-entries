## 23:03 Wednesday 30 May 2018 JST

On Wednesdays, I wake up at 5am and leave the house at 5:45am so I can
get on a train that arrives in Noborito at 6:29am but leaves Noborito
at 6:57am.  That gives 58 minutes of sleeping time on the train
including both waiting and riding to Kawasaki.

Then lesson in Solid Square with Ayano, Takato, Yohei, Ai, and I
talking about reasons we (dis)like certain months or seasons.  A bit
challenging lesson because the students are at such different levels.

Then chatted for a long time with Christian at
[Japanese IO](https://www.japanese.io/) about their upcoming features:

1. Sharing
2. Listening
3. Automagic SRS

Hopefully the site will support many people in learning Japanese.

Lunch with Tomoko at SCC and then briefly said HI to Liliko and Hitomi
(who work together) there before lesson with Midori (who works with
Tomoko).

Then to JB for two lessons with elementary school students, and two
lessons with adults from age 24 (or so) to 50 (or so).  These again
were challenging due to different levels.  I'm kinda glad Misato could
not make it today.

Walked to the station with Chihomi(?) and Kaori.  Chihomi had just run
a half marathon this past weekend, and asked us abut our marathon
histories.  Mine is zilch, and I was surprised to hear Kaori
had/sometimes(?) runs 5km around Imperial Palace in central Tokyo.  8
times around for a full marathon.  haha yeah I ain't doing that!

Train and then rode home with Lin who usually picks me up at the
station on Wednesday nights.  She had just gone to see
[Amma](http://www.amma-rainichi.org/english/) (and Paola, who is
likely to leave Japan for a while) with our neighbor Mai.
