Great day at a park, but there were briars in the grass.  Got to talk
to Aaron for quite a bit and catch up with Francine who invited him.
My student Misato attended and joined our little outing to find a
[nearby geocache](https://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?LUID=f5e6ca10-abc0-4bb3-aa8f-8a7b1a366c96) which she was actually the one to find.

I napped for 30 minutes in the tent that went largely unused.

12 or so peeps in attendance; cozy and fun!
