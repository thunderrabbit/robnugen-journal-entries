This is the fourth to last lesson at BRIDGE.  They started off strong,
but then started to get busy quite quickly last summer.  Two hours of
lessons went down to 1 hour which sucked considering it took 3 hours
round trip travel.  But I kept at it.  During December they cancelled
January saying they will be too busy.  So I had a nice break during
January, during which they said the will end at the end of February.
