After work today, Lin and I met at the station and as a little
"romantic" gift, I bought reserved seats so we could take Romance Car
to our station.  It was nice to just be able to relax all the way
home.  Curiously, when Lin tried to pay for my bus fare, it wouldn't
go through so the driver just let us on the bus free.  Yay!

I guess we should try to pay for each other's fare more often on the
bus, to help them get the bugs out of their system, and to get free
seats.
