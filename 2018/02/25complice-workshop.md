The complice workshop was pretty good and gave heaps of information
about how to get shiz done.  Kinda like info overload, but certainly
not a boring event!  I bought a year membership for $120 to keep using
them.  Check out https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu (referral link) to
get three weeks trial.

After the workshop, I got the email viewer done for AB and pushed it
to live server.  Still haven't got the unread emails indicator done.
