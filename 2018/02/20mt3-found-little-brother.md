I had previously thought of having the little brother come running up
to see what all the fuss was about, and knock everyone off the
stage. But I have done that once, and it wastes a bunch of time, and
the timing didn't work out anyway.

So in the end, the characters who were looking for him all turn
around one by one.  Candycane mom will put her hands on her hips after
she fully turns around.  This will be the last frames I add to this
Take in Dragonframe.  After this, we'll have six (6) snippets in the
playlist.
