I cannot decide if I should care that my accountants apparently cannot
spell or cannot hire proofreaders or what.  Does it make a difference?
Should I complain?  Stop using them?  Is this just a case of English
language changing?

I mean language is a tool to transmit meaning between people and
written language is a tool to transmit meaning across time as well.  I
know what they mean, but could there be a case where it's not clear?
"It is" contains a verb, but "its" contains the idea of possession.

Anyway, I left them a note and hope they will fix it and give me a
discount for reporting it, like a bug bounty program.  But until it's
fixed, I will not recommend their service.
