I was late to SOGO because I was late leaving and forgot my phone so
had to come back.

I was a bit late arriving, but they were late starting so it all
worked out.  Haha we worked out as well.  My toe injury did not bleed
and was basically fine, though now it's dirty.  I was puffed by the
group workout at the end, running while piggybacking Naoki, but even more
impressive was him running while piggybacking me.

Went to lunch with Zach, Naoki, Ai, and Asuka at the mexican
restaurant where the SOGO group has been going recently.  Hella closer
than the other Mexican place, but fewer lunch options.

Glad I got my phone so Tariq and I could coordinate meeting after
SOGO.
