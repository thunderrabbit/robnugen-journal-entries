Is it a waste to get a new phone after my phone's screen broke to the
point that I put tape on it to keep pieces of glass from falling out?

keep the phone encased in case it fell, which it eventually did, and
shattered the screen.

New phone arrived yesterday and was really easy to copy the bulk of
data over and download apps again.  The phones talked via Bluetooth to
figure out why they were and what to do.
