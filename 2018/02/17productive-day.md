Did five pomodoros on ConSwi today, including refactoring the code to
ostensibly make it simpler, but for some reason I could not get the
tiles to respond to touches.  So I will try to make an overlay that
captures all touches and have it tell which piece got touched.

[Complice](https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu)(referral link) has a
neat feature of parsing the Intention and automatically marking it as
complete.  I will definitely take advantage of that in the future.
