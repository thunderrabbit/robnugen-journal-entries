Tomoko did well in our lessons in the SSC.  She had to give a
presentation in English today.  Midori does not have to present as
soon so she is trying to memorize more, it seems.

Lessons were after we ate lunch together on the 4th floor.  I still
kinda feel like an outsider there, as if my face and Visitor badge are
flashing beacons.
