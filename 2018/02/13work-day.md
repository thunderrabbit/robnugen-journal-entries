Worked at IL for ist today, and then with CE for MR, and then talked
to Chika at B for JB.

Now going to AB to talk to T and S-san.

Tired, I would rather go home.

Oh, but I got past the
[tween issue I had with Godot 3](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/godot_3_tween_example/commit/22be1003fb5519acfcd1e9e4fa8ae4340a2607ac)

Yay!
