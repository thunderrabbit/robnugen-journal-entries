Been working on MT3 pretty consistently, and started working on AB
again now that the new verbal agreement has started.

Recently I found
[complice (referral link)](https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu) which
seems like a pretty good system for organizing my day and stuff.  I
have 19 days in my free test period.

Complice has a slight learning curve, but built-in pomodoros plus a
magic way that when I open a new tab it reminds me what my latest
thing to do is.  Complice connects my tasks with my larger goals, and
allows me to fill in some of the WHY I am doing different tasks, to
help keep me on task.

It is because of complice that I am writing this journal entry now.

Anyway, I stubbed the <del>crap out</del> <ins>skin off</ins> of my
toe yesterday and will wear shoes for a bit.


I wonder how long that image will be available.

Right now I am writing this entry while waiting for the AB server to
finish its backup.

Ah wait a minute.  Another backup started at the same time.  That may
be why they are going slowly.  I will look at them tomorrow.
