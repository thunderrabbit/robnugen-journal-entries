Upon arrival at the convenience store near men's group which features
a counter featuring electrical outlets, I noticed a suspicious lack of
inventory on the shelves.  The guy at the register said they are
closing next week (at 7am on Tuesday) and he didn't know if it would
ever reopen.

Even worse, [we are the threat](https://criticaltheoryresearchnetwork.com/2018/02/14/threat-reflections-near-term-human-extinction/).
