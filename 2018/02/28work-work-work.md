I'm on break now at JB, listening to the other class, where the
teacher's Japanesey English always kinda bugs me.  But the students
seem happy and have been in the class for a long time.

This morning thinking about C who apparently took my investment advice
before bitcoin blew up.  She quit her job and is overseas now.
hahahah nice!

Then working on AB, getting three alleged issues sorted.  Only one was
actually valid, but we had a chat on the phone and got them sorted.  I
fixed the one issue and then explained it to Kai who happened to come
by on her way to work.

Hi Kai!

Then went to SCC and talked to Tomoko and Midori for an hour each, not
counting lunch with Tomoko (Midori and Yuko chose not to join).

Zoom here to JB and two kids classes, the first of which went by
easily thanks to Patrick's (neverending) Day of Week game, and the
second of which went easily due to my shopping game.

Was barefoot between Sh and SCC.  Socks now, but will be barefoot on
the way home tonight.
