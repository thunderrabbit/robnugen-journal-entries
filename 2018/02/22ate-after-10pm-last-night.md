Yeah so last night against my better judgement, I ate at night.  I
mean it wasn't a ton, but maybe 1/2 kg, including a bunch of sugar.

This morning my stomach is like "ugh with a big fat ball of fat"

Lin felt about the same, so I made a contract with her to not eat
after 9pm, 32 times in the next 38 days.
