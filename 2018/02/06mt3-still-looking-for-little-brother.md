I got a couple seconds of easy filming done today during which I
debated for a bit if I should have people get worried about little
brother.  Ultimately decided yes, and I'm quite happy with the results
so far!  The guy with green head is now helping big brother look for
little brother.  Candy Cane has finished coming up the ramp with a
load of five popsicle sticks.  The very last frame of the film I
output today shows little brother barely visible between the stage
platters.  I haven't uploaded it to Youtube yet, but I assume I will
when I get back home or find free wifi somewhere.
