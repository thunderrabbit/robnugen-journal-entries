Today I did 1.5 hours of live stream to get about 1 second of new
video added to Dragonframe's ongoing take.

In the foreground on the left, the cutter cut a piece (I decided to
redo about 7 frames to get his cut lined up properly) which the gluer
glued into place.  In the foreground on the right, the 8th rib is
being put into place.  In the background, the big brother is looking
for his little brother who has fallen and vanished somewhere.

In about 60 frames from now, he will appear between the platters of
the stage.
