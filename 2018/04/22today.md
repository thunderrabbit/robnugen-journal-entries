oops it is tomorrow already, but today Lin and I had neighbors Richard
and Mai over for lunch, and then went for a walk with them and Fitz.
We found a geocache.

I got a sharp flake of plastic splintered into my foot on the way
home.  Thankfully Lin was able to get it out relatively easily.

Today was the last day for
[Build Your Speaker Bio](https://www.yourspeakingjourney.com/) course;
I will miss everyone and am really thankful for how much Soness helped
with my speaker sheet.
