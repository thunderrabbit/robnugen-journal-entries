I decided to recreate this
[reverse fishtank](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8546lp/reverse_fishtank/)
in Minecraft, but for some reason it is all dark when I view it from
the outside.  Not sure how to make the underwater view look lighter.

I did it the lazy way with a fill command, decided to expand it, and made a huge
dark area where tons of monsters instantly spawned.

I filled it in with torches so *more* monsters will not spawn, but am
leaving these here for Fred and I to kill when we come back to the
server in survival mode.
