Today while I was in the cafe below Muza, a woman came up and asked if
I could speak English.  I drew her a map to a bank on the other side
of the station, but had a slightly bad feeling about sending her on a
possible wild goose chase.  Her name is Dipika, and she's been in
Japan just a little bit and will be here for 2 more weeks.  She didn't
exchange currency at the airport so she had no yen to buy a ticket,
and they don't take credit cards.  She's interested in finance, and
asked me my thoughts on Bitcoin once I told her I did computer stuff.

She said she's interested in China for the financial possibilities,
and I definitely agree; it seems Chinese economy is on the rise.

Anyway, I walked with her to the bank .... and discovered only ATM
machines were there.  She needed to talk to a person.  I misremembered
what street had her bank so we walked to the wrong street for a
different bank and then we were like bah and just went to Shinagawa
station where she could exchange her voucher to get her JR Rail pass.

The staff there spoke English enough to help her find a mobile wifi
provider, so we went there and got her hooked up with wifi for two
weeks.  Once she got some cash exchanged in Shinagawa, she paid me
back for the train ticket to Shinagawa from Kawasaki.  I gave her the
money back in exchange for updates during her adventures.

Here's hoping Dipika has a great trip!
