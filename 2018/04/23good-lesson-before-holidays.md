Good lesson at IL this morning, though only two students attended.  I
praised the student who came 35 minutes late to thank her for
attending even though it was apparently a challenge to join.

Next week's lesson is canceled due to a week of holidays, so on May
7th, I will invite them to talk about their holidays in English.
