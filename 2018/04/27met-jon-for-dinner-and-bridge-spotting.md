Jon and I ate burgers after we did a bit of a code review and MySQL
discussion.  Short answer: it's better to loop through via code than
do group+sort+filter+etc in MySQL.

After discussion, he showed me a lovely bridge across a river.  It
connects a building to a parking area with 15 bicycle parking spots on
the far side of a river.  15 bicycle parking spots is a joke compared
to the size of the building, and even the bridge itself, which
features glass elevators on each side.

We found a couple of weird cables on the elevators, one of which I
photographed with the intention of maybe posting on /r/whatisthisthing
but I will probably forget to do so.  Not even sure I will remember to
post it here, given that it's late and I am writing this while on the
train, and will probably get sidetracked when I get home and to wifi.
