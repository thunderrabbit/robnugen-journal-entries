I added lots of frames yesterday to Marble Track 3 video.  There was a
long section with just 2 or 3, or even just 1 character moving at a
time. I added 20 seconds to the video, which destroys any previous day
expect maybe the first couple days when I just had the manager walking
around.

I did not exactly predict the current situation; I just knew the
chopstick poking off the edge of the track should do something.  It
ended up knocking over a bridge, which knocked the switch into fast
mode which caused some havoc including Candy Cane Mom and Green Cutter
to lean toward the center of the stage to offset centrifugal force
due to the rotational velocity.  (I think my terms are correct here).

Once the stage was stopped, they fell on their faces, and the large
marble rolled off the stage from where it had been held by the
relatively newly placed ribs, which hopefully indicates (1) the ribs
work, (2) there is at least some sense of internal logic to the movie.
