Today was the last lesson for Ushigoro.  We had finished up everything
last week, having done their exams, so today we just did lots of Q and
A sessions, first with the class split into two groups, and then with
all students asking questions of one student.

I offered my LINE QR code in case they want to ask questions or
continue practicing their English.  I hope this helps them stay
engaged until the next session starts.
