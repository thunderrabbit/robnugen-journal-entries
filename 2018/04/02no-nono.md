While walking from Roppongi down to my lunchtime lesson, I walked past
a woman (after admiring her tattoo), and then she walked past me and
said, "hey I like your style," referring to my bare feet.  Turns out
she works at [Gonpachi](http://gonpachi.jp/?page_id=22),
[aka the Kill Bill restaurant](https://thecitylane.com/tokyo-gonpachi-aka-kill-bill-restaurant/).
She invited me to come by, so I did around 1:45pm.

She must have been busy or the message did not get to her, but no
Nono.  I left her a note; I hope that gets to her.  I forgot to draw a
bare foot on it.

Okay, Nono, your turn!  Check out the co-gender group which meets on
Monday nights 7pm - 9pm very close to the restaurant!

circle, but the
