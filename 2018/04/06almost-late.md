Not as late as last night, but may not get to bed by my target of
midnight.

Watched too much damn ER with Lin, but I gotta admit it's a good
show.  We are at Season 5 Episode 3 or so.

Had three meetings this morning, getting off to a great start, but did
*not* do any paid work.  Did do 1.3 hours of MT3, but have not
uploaded the results yet.  Might as well do that tonight.

Okay Dragonframe is exporting the clip now.

Did some good work on ConSwi as well.

One of the fans on my computer is making noise.  I need to reboot the
machine anyway, so I guess I will do that and take it apart tonight.
