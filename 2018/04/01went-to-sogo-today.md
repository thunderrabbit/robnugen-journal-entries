"Happy Easter!"

"It's not Easter!"

"?????"

"April Fools!"

Finally got back to SOGO today and it was touch!  Camelia (sp) saw me
and was like, "remember me??" and I was like, "I remember your *face*"
(could be an insult, but wasn't in this case), and she reminded me she
had volunteered for [Peace Boat](http://peaceboat.org/) since I last
saw her.  So neat to hear that it's growing but still has the same
genki energy as before.  She said in 2020 they are going to have a new
eco-friendly ship!
