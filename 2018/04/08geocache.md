Lin joined me today as I found my
[first geocache](https://coord.info/GLVF178K)

I want to place my own cache, but the site suggests finding between 20
and 100 caches before placing my own.  Bah.  I guess I will find a
couple others before I place one.  But the other crummy thing is the
place I wanted to place a cache is apparently too close to the cache I
found.
