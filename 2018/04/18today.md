New regular students in SS lesson this morning; Kaede stopped coming
relatively soon after joining last year, and Chika apparently took my
bitcoin advice (whereas I did not haha) so she moved overseas.
Satoshi has not come recently, and Sayuri said she was busy today,
plus said Ayano something something so could not come.  Nonoka and Ai
came today.  Ai helped Nonoka with some phrases and months of the
year.  We played a little month game asking the date of Christmas,
Halloween, Tanabata, White Day, etc.

Now I am in a cafe on ground floor of Muza watching pigeons and peeps
walk, fly, and or meander through the breezeway.
