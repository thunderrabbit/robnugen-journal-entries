I forgot the monthly Integration Group Coordinator call is at 9am
Japan time now that the time has sprung forward an hour.  I was a few
minutes late to the call, but all was good.  Oh that reminds me, I
gotta correct the time in my reminder messages for next month.

We talked about suicide prevention, and ways to raise awareness of
this issue and how people can get support.
