This morning I woke up with a start in Noborito, where I transfer
between lines from Odakyu main line to JR Nambu line.

"Oh snap my stop!" and bounced out of my seat, got off the train and
was confused about how far down the platform I was.

"Where am I?  This is... ohhhh..." and went back in the train and sat
back down in my seat.  (thankfully no one else took it!)

I had already transferred in Noborito, and had fallen asleep on the
Nambu line train which *starts* in Noborito.
