SOGO is 2 years old today, so the organizers suggested a picnic in
Yoyogi after the workout.  Great workout and picnic with maybe 100
peeps and 80 peeps in attendance, respectively.  I chatted with Hide,
who has come for quite a while, and some first timers, Kino, Anna, and
Laurie.  Actually I don't know if it was Kino's first time, but it was
my first time to meet her.

As I'm typing now, I think I might have sprained my thumb.  While
walking earlier, I could definitely feel a strain in my ankle.  Good
times.
