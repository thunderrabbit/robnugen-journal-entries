Just smiling after watching the latest snippet for Marble Track 3
construction.  It's the one called "[Brotherly Spat](https://youtu.be/hxZ3cE1Gh6c)" on YouTube.
In it, the brothers get into a fight, which they had done a little bit
in the first video, but this time, *it's on*, as they said on
Southpark, and the brothers' fight is meant to look like a cartoon
dust cloud with random feet and other extremities poking out of the
cloud as it hovers in mid air.

I think the fight will continue for a while, but I am not sure if I can
do anything interesting with it, nor how to end it.

But, I like the video as it stands for now and am looking forward to
making more.

I had planned to work on it for an hour today, but got my schedule
mixed up.
