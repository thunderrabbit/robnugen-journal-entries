Fossil is awesome, but I am not ready to switch quite yet.

Can I get Fossil to host my journal like I have Hugo doing now?
Should I?  The point was to have it as a static site, so I guess not,
but it seems weird to use something that can host sites just to track
the site content and not host the site.

ConSwi is not open source, but it is sufficiently small and
not-production that I might try.  AB is equally not open source, but
definitely not small.  Hmmm.

So far, I only know a couple commands in Fossil and they seem longer
than equivalent git commands, but I have not read even a, well, I have
read a fraction of the Fossil docs, but not a lot.
