I contacted the organizer of TEDx Roppongi, which is scheduled for
November 3rd of this year.  I'm not sure if I will end up helping with
that, but I'm interested, because eventually I would like to speak on
stage at a TEDx event.

In other news, I'm preparing for a workshop to be held on November
23rd, which will be an introduction to the men's group work that we
do.  We plan to allow only 12 new attendees to attend that workshop.

We have a typhoon coming apparently.  As always with typhoons in
Tokyo, I'm not too worried.  The storms end up being less impressive
than a normal spring storm in Houston.

Mixed-gender group was cancelled today for the second week in a row
due to lack of attendance.  boo.

One of my new students paid me Friday yay.
