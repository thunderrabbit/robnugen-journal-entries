Headed to JB now soon; hopefully no big concern from the typhoon.  I
will bring my rain coat, but I ain't too worried.

The typhoon has been like a typhoon for ants.

But my train is nearly empty because apparently nobody came to work.
Or at least everyone left work early.

I'm just finishing work and heading home now.
