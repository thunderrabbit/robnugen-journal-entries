I got a new backpack a couple of days ago.  Actually it is a hybrid
rolling backpack.  It was less than 1/2 price because of the color,
approximately あかむらさき "red purple" according to one of my magic
markers.  I would call it magenta.

Lin does not like the color.  I figure no one will steal it, plus it
is easy to identify in a lineup.

I will keep my old backpack until I travel a few times without needing
it.
