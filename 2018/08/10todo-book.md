I bought a book that has become my todo book.  It's as portable as my
phone and even more reliable in terms of battery power.  I bought it
on Tuesday and have used it daily since then.  Wow four days in total.

So far I have used a single page per day.  (It's 91mm x 160mm x 6mm,
featuring 96 pages and two covers within the 6mm thickness.  It's
about the same size as my phone.)  If I keep going at the current
rate, (one side of paper per day,) it should last 6 months.
