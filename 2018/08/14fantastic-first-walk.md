I have decided to wake up at 5am each day, and on the five days I do not
have to immediately go to work (for which I have already been waking
up at 5am), I will go for a brisk walk around the neighborhood.

Today I went up the hill and along the ridge and up left on a street I
had never walked before, then up a hill into a park and then omg down
a spooky mossy staircase with spiderweb strands hitting my face and
cicadas buzzing my ears and mosquitoes chomping my legs.   Upon arrival
at the bottom, I turned left onto a little street and met Mr Kasahara
who was like, "can I show you?" and I was like "please!" and he showed
me a rainbow colored [<ruby><rb>玉虫</rb><rt>たまむし</rt></ruby>
insect he called a *tamamushi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysochroa_fulgidissima),
and went on at length about how it was such a rare find.  I was able
to understand about 50% of what he was saying.

The area where he lived used to be named Kasahara, but the Odawara
clan(?) came over and Mr Kasahara had to flee (for his life).  He is
85 years old, and apparently has a fair few stories to tell.  I hope
to see him tomorrow and bring my recorder to record some of his
stories for science and study etc.
