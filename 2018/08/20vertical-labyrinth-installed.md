A couple of years ago I received a vertical labyrinth game from the
toy store I used to frequent in Harajuku on the way to my lesson with
Sarumama.

In the past couple of days I decided to mount the game on our wall so
we can actually play with it!

Here is the game resting on a shelf, where any decent sized earthquake
could send it toppling to disaster.  It had been like this for a while.

On the back it has hooks which allow it to be mounted securely to the
wall.

I made some brackets that were basically the right size and color to
match the game and its brackets.

Here is the only indication of the maker.  This is printed on the back
of the game.

Jennie helped herself to the table while I used it to place the game
at the right height.

[![2018 aug 6 height adjusted](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2018/vertical_labyrinth/thumbs/2018_aug_6_height_adjusted.jpg)](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2018/vertical_labyrinth/2018_aug_6_height_adjusted.jpg)

Once I knew how high to place them, I added the supports

[![2018 aug 23 one support](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2018/vertical_labyrinth/thumbs/2018_aug_23_one_support.jpg)](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2018/vertical_labyrinth/2018_aug_23_one_support.jpg)
[![2018 aug 23 two supports](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2018/vertical_labyrinth/thumbs/2018_aug_23_two_supports.jpg)](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2018/vertical_labyrinth/2018_aug_23_two_supports.jpg)

And mounted it on the wall!
