I heard some water trickling and noticed a fountain flowing into a
basin made of bricks.  There were a couple fish inside, effectively
making it a brick fishtank.

The sky was overcast so not too hot.

Oh, today was the day I walked across part of the dirt lot and up into
the back corner area.  I didn't think to take pics while on the
inside, but I might go again.
