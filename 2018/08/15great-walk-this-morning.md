##### 07:19 Wednesday 15 August 2018 JST

I woke up several times last night like 3am, 4am, and then ended up
waking up at 5:30am instead of 5am for my walk.  Got out of the house
bleary eyed by 5:45 am and headed toward かさはら's place.  He wasn't
outside (and I was 45 minutes later than the previous day) so I
strolled on past and walked up stairs to the right and met a man who I
ended up exercising with in a park (Takaishi Dai 3 Park, according to
Google Maps).  He said he is 73 years old and stays healthy so he can
play tennis.  It's people like him who are my models, old and

(energetic, chipper, healthy)


The tag 545-719 refers to when I left the house and when I got back
to write this entry.

2.8km traveled according to Google Maps.
