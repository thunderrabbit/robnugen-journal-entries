Audible requests too many permissions on Android Audible app.

Why do you need my identity?  My contacts?  My microphone?  My call information?

* Identity
    Uses one or more of: accounts on the device, profile data
* Contacts
    Uses contact information
* Microphone
    Uses the device's microphone(s)
* Device ID & call information
    Allows the app to determine the phone number and device IDs,
    whether a call is active, and the remote number connected by a call
