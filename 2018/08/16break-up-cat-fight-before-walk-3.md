Just before 5am, Lin let Jennie outside for her morning adventures.
Soon thereafter we could hear her catching up with another cat.  I
woke up for my walk and headed toward the altercation.  Unfortunately
my approach was a catalyst for amplification of the catastrophe.  They
catapulted away from each other and Jennie ran under a car before I
could catch her.

I continued walking and went 2.9 km according to Google.  My phone
didn't track me as precisely as I would have liked, though.  I hoped
to see some more waypoints than I got on the map.  Might have to find
an app to do it.
