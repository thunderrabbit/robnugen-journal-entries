Been working on my taxes for 2017.  I filed them on time, but did not
provide any list of expenses.  Now they are like "yeah you owe $2000."

I have compiled a list of expenses based on the train stations I had
to use to get to the various lessons.  Hopefully that will be enough.

I have been keeping better track of my expenses in 2018.
