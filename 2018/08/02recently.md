1. It's hotter in Tokyo this summer than summers in my memory.  It's
   been getting up to 34 - 35 degrees Celcius as the high, with some hot spots
   in the 40s
2. I bought https://www.marbletrack3.com/ and have got a reasonable
   start on how to display each livestream as an episode.  I started
   making a page for each character, calling them workers, and even
   got some translation support from Tomoko at Showspace in SCC.
3. Regarding the translation for marbletrack3.com, I only have done
   the menus, and even just that is done poorly (links are still
   broken)
4. But the site is open source so I can hopefully get some help from
   people on https://gohugo.io
5. Speaking of open source, for ConSwi programming, I often get stuck
   on questions that are difficult to explain unless I can show the
   source code.  I want to go back to open sourcing the code, and just
   worry about how to open source the code, but not the images.
6. Lin and I have a new bed frame but no bed.  The bed apparently did
   not fit up the stairwell, but I was not there to witness it.
7. My backpack needs some more mending.  I plan to work on it later today.
8. Also later today: Meet Cathy The Relationship Artist at 5pm, have
   GG lesson in Akihabara at 6:30pm, head home for Japanese lesson at
   10pm, finish right on time for English lesson with Aki's friend Y
   at 11pm.
9. I have realized that I need support promoting the men's circle; I
   don't really write on FB to invite people nor even announce
   upcoming interesting presentations, etc.
10. I may have found the backpack that will replace the backpack I
    have had for a while and have kept repairing as it rips in various
    places.
