Lin and I got off to a later start than I had originally planned, but
we walked an hour around our neighborhood, finding some new streets we
had never used before and arriving via different routes in places we
had been before.  "Oh!  we're *here*!" kinda thing.

Wow!  3.9km in 58 minutes, according to Google maps.
