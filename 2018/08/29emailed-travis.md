    I have begun to unpack my life mission: to create a world of
    safety, love, and connection by teaching, inviting, and sharing.
    This is connected to the men's group work I do and lead.  My
    intention is to make the high E.Q. tools as natural skills for
    everyone to know.

    It is my intention to start promoting this philosophy of living:
    heal the emotions within and experience a more fulfilling life.
    "Turn your greatest frustrations into your greatest asset" is a
    line that has been suggested.  It sounds click baity to me, so I
    am trying to work out the best way to express what I mean.

    I will start writing some more posts on my related website

    For the past couple of years now, I sometimes have to wake up at
    5am to leave at 5:45 am.  But that is only two days a week that I
    teach early lessons.  On four or five of the other days per week,
    I have started waking up at 5am to go for a walk around my
    neighborhood for an hour or so.  This has helped me get a jump
    start on exercise, input (brain food), and on my day.  I am
    usually back and working before I would have even been out of bed
    on my old schedule.

    My creative time has been spent working on Marble
    Track 3. https://www.marbletrack3.com/ I hope to put at least two
    hours per week into the project until its completion.  I have
    about 10+ minutes of output video so far, none with audio.
    Sometimes I wonder just what I have gotten myself into here.
