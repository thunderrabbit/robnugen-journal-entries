After watching
"[A Journey Towards Inner Beauty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POZI6GaXCSY),"
[Shirley Liu](https://www.instagram.com/sheergloss/) being interviewed
on
[The Happy Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnacDHcojfYWkP0ab6LNvaA),

I have been thinking about my morning routine.  Today I came upon a
grand idea to exercise each morning by walking around my local area
for perhaps 20 or 30 minutes on days that I do not have to leave at
5:45 in the morning.

Lin walked with me today, and we saw some interesting old (and not as
interesting new) houses in our neighborhood on streets I had never
previously used.  This could be a fun healthy adventure!

Had a quick meeting with Tariq this morning about
[ConSwi](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi).  At this point
there are 2
[open issues](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues)
([#2](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/2) and
[#6](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/6)) and Tariq will
adjust the size of the image which shows players to swipe pieces.

After writing this entry, I will go to SOGO for weekly workout and
after that join Lin at Chazu's house in town.
