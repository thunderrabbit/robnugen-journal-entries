<p>Hello,  this is Ben, your typer for this evening. We
will be hearing quotes from two games of Silent Football tonight.</p>

<p class=date>Game #1, in no particular order.</p>

<p>Mr. Kisses - Uses bad country lawyer accent, twice, if
forced to come up with a different accent each time he
talkes.</p>

<p>First Accent: Bad hindu accent, says 'like a cobra
trying to pass kidney stones through his galbladder',
Mrs. Elizabeth notices the error and he is given
penance.</p>

<p>Second Accent: Bad Hitler, is accused of being racist,
is awarded penance points.</p>

<p>Third Accent: British Lord, is accused to be slipping
in and out of Australian accent, is sold  a
non-penance point if he doesn't use either accent
again.</p>

<p>Miss Inclined - 'I think Mrs. one space to my left is
dead.'</p>

<p>Mr. Dictator - 'Mrs. Emma is awarded one half of one
penance point for breaking the fifth rally rule: no
dying.'</p>

<p class=date>Game #2</p>

<p>(the game's attempt to start)
<br>Nick's reaction to penance points for being from AR
'Gosh Darnit'</p>

<p>Katie is Mistress scratch and sniff</p>

<p>Senor Donut  en   mi  pantalones (mike h. )</p>

<p>(Lauuren I.)  Miss  thanksgivings-with-meagyn-cusack
Ryan is a dumbass</p>

<p>'oh god, rob, I've heard the voice of  your shirt!' 
whoo else  but Ryan (Rob burped)</p>

<p>parody 
of silent football by  distractions  of the  universe
named Dan and Ben ('tip  of the ass')</p>

<p>foreign perpetrators turn on each other</p>

<p>We  start the game,  Ryan metaphors  the football with
his penis, talks  bullshit again</p>

<p>customary 'cyberskin'</p>

<p>Miss Jane Bond not only fwapped a fwap  fwap but
reversed the direction of the football at the same
time and received penance points on request (also
spoke out of turn but no one called  it)</p>

<p>2.7 min into the game, Stevie kills us (hookah smoking
caterpillar) by shroduming a shrug</p>

<p>customary 'I didn't see anything'</p>

<p>Nick zoomed a zoom zoom, has spaz attack.  Commandante
Googliemonster cottagefries. 'My heart. My heart is
sad' 'pee-shiveriing pronoun. U get the pee shivers?!'
<br>(Who else? Ryan!)</p>

<p>---------</p>

<p>Lauren O typing Silent football</p>

<p class=date>June 10, 2001, 5:25a</p>

<p>Ryan 
compares silent universe to weird foriegn film
involving mime selling wife</p>

<p>there is a giant spitwad on the  ceiling that  Nick 
is  pointing out to Ryan.</p>

<p>loud bodily noises and Nick zoomed a zoom zoom .</p>

<p>Rob says 'Mrs. Thanksgiving With Meg Cusack gets ::blah  blah:: points for 
belching  so unfeminininnilly.  (Note: Mrs. TWMC's
name is so to verify that Meg cusack is to marry
nathan ryan so her name will be meg ryan and so she
can spend   thanksgivings with Lauren Ingram.)</p>

<p>Cole (dark haired one)  leaves game because his  name kept
getting fucked over</p>

<p>'the entire room is on  crack and needs groovy juice' 
--Hooka Smoking Caterpillar (Lauren and Stevie)</p>

<p>Mrs. TWMC   gives stylized shrodum after realizing
that ftbl was being sent to her, and giving sender  a
flirty wave.   haha.   miss thanksgiving  with  meg
ryan rocks the hizouse.</p>

<p>when zoomed to,  Nick ggoes 'mmumhmmm......oh,uh' 
entity outside  universe yells zipper in the eye,
foreskin ruffles enter conversation as the latest
plastic surgery,. Nick is appointed dick tator.</p>

<p>customary  'codictators'</p>

<p>Lauren and Nick  share reign of stupidity
Mrs. It</p>

<p class=note>Editor (Rob's) notes:</p>

<p class=note>The game ended as Lauren (who had been typing) and Nick
verbally fought for the dictatorship.  Quite entertaining, especially
at 6am after having been awake all night.</p>

<p class=note>ps: I wish I had given Lauren (Miss Thanksgiving With
Meg Cusack) <em>negative</em> penance points for burping so
un-femininily.  I appreciate a great belch as much as the next person
who appreciates a great belch, and I sure don't want to discourage
someone for letting a great belch rip forth into the Silent
Universe.</p>
