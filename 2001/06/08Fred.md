<p>Fred, as you know, is smart.</p>

<p>I haven't taken the time to really look at all the
stuff he sent me, but the bottom line is he wrote a
shopping cart in perl.  That rules.  That's awesome. 
I'm highly impressed.</p>

<p>I don't know if the links are open to the public,
but if they are, I may link them from my site.</p>
