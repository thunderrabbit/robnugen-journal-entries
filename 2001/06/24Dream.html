<p class=dream>With YRUU peeps and we were traveling up to OKC for a
rally.  Except we weren't driving; we were in suspended gondolas like
those that go slowly over amusement parks.  I was in a gondola with
Sarah from ultimte,  Colleen C, and Adam L.</p>

<p class=dream>We could see Nick C and Annie in a different gondola.</p>

<p>I don't remember much else.</p>
