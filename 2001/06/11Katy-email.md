My waistline is right above my hips, but that seems
like kinda personal question, there.

Oh!  *Waterline*!  At our house, water came to within
50 feet of the house.  And by 50 feet, I mean 50
vertical feet.  We were high and dry.  Water was 6
feet deeper over the intersection at Allen Parkway and
Montrose.

I'm pretty much really bummed that I didn't get to
experience it, and by experience, I mean see the
flood, not have my house soaked.

I'm trying to imagine what it must have been like.  I
can see the waterlines about a foot above the Richmond
ground level area.  The ground floor of our building
got about 3 inches of water in it.  I haven't looked
for pictures on the web yet, but I want to *see* the
water up to the 4 bridges that cross 59.

It seems slightly spooky to me that in 1998 we got to
the 100 year flood line, and in 2001, we beat the shit
out of that record by six feet.

I'm super glad that your family and house and home and
boat and lifevests are all okay.  I wonder if Zeke and
Zack will remember.  What are their names again?

Soon I will flood my journal with entries from the
weekend, which includes us almost being halted in
Conroe getting out of the city.

If you do need to water your lawn today, go downtown
where they are giving water away free.

     With Love and wit
