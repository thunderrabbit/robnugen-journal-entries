<p>Wende and I are in Altus, Oklahoma at the cabin with Stacy and Rodd
and Karston.  This is Big Daddy's cabiin, and has been in the family
for a long ass time.</p>

<p>Wende painted that big tractor wheel sandbox.  Picture of Wende
and her dad on his motorcycle.  That's the hill where Wende popped her
first wheelie on motorcylce.  That's the hill where Wende had her
first accident on motorcycle, and she pushed it all the way to here
and decided not to push it up the hill so she left it in a neighbor's
yard and got her Meme.</p>

<p>On the way up here, I drove from Corsicana or so through Ft Worth
and we ate iin Witchita Falls, which is good because I've always
wanted to go to Witchita Falls, but....  Witchita Falls is nothing
like I had hoped.  I was looking for lots of forest and a river with
waterfall.  It's just a small Texas city with highway construction and
a Wendy's with the Frosty machine broken.</p>

<p>We hit approximately one million bugs after it got dark as we
crossed the state line.  Gross!!!!</p>

<p>Arrived at Uncle Mark and Aunt Joy's house and watched the last
little bit of some 15 year old home videos, the funniest of which was
seeing then-8-year-old Brian break dancing to Wende singiing Billie
Jean.  He was flopping and falling all over the carpet..  So funny!
Especially as he kept flopping to no music and then, 'Brian, it's
over.'</p>
