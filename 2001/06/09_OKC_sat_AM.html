<p>We arrived around 4am and I was happy to remember
*most* of the names of youth who came to say HI and
get a Rob Hug.  :-)!!</p>

<p>Been awake talking to:</p>

<p><ul><li> Becky T, the adult in charge of the rally</li>
<li>Laura Douglas with
<ol>
<li>Ryan M about the board repressing youth worship.</li>
<li>Nick G about the YAC not controlling youth enough.</li>
</ol>
</ul></p>

<p>Now I'm outside tossing the disc with Tanner and Mattboy.</p>

<p>Houston is pretty flooded, Wende's friend Julie had two feet of
water in her house.  ouch!!!</p>

<p>Our house is okay.  Did I just write that?  Wende is
going to Julie's house to help her clean.</p>

<p>Wende got home from work at midnight last night.</p>

<p>It's as flooded as it was when I took pictures with
Eric..  Cars were abandoned on Westeimer and Shepered,
and it's entirely wack.  I would really like to be
there to take pictures!!!!!!</p>

<p>Wende says HI.</p>

<p>I'm going to sleep now.  I've slept 4 hours so far
since Friday morning.</p>
