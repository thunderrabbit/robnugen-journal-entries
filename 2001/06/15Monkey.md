<p>Exactly 1 week and 1 year until Wende and I are married!!  So
strange to think that, and to have had such a long engagement.  I
trust that we will be ready and all kinds of good stuff by then.</p>

<p>Our class instructor keeps using the word 'monkey' as a verb, as in
'you can monkey with the program ...' blah blah, and I keep thinking
of my wonderfully funny friend Alexis from KTRU who is (was) a
linguistics major, and said her favorite word sounds were those that
have the n-k-y sound, like 'monkey' and 'linky'.  Sometimes she would
just say 'monkey monkey monkey, I just love that word!'</p>

<p>After lunch, Rob and I tossed his frisbee around in the lovely sun.
I got pretty hot, and he was wearing pants and shoes; he's probably
more hot.  Regina is all, 'it's cold in here!'  'No it's not,' Robs
say.</p>
