<p>Wende and I just went for a hike around the yucca plant near the
cabin.  So much fun!  Wende got pissed though because of somethiing.
I'm not sure what.  She got apricot between her toes.  Maybe that was
it.  I think I maybe pushed her too hard to hike and she got mad at
that.</p>

<p>But I certainly had fun and I won't forget it!</p>

<p>Leaving the cabin for Tangie's wedding soon.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Ceremony was beautiful and small; the wedding reception was greatly
attended.  I danced like a maniac and hopefully got some people out on
the floor.  Or maybe I scared them away.  But a few people asked if I
could teach them how to dance like that. </p>

<p>"I just fake it; I don't know how to dance.  Just let the music
move you."</p>

<p>Stopped by a car wash to wash all the bugs off the front of Wende's
truck before we bake them on while driving back to Houston.</p>

<p>While I washed the bugs off, Wende got a monster bug bite on her
shoulder.  She said it really really hurt and she almost cried.  Wow.
Kinda like my scorpion sting 3 years ago.  The bite had a red dot in
the middle about 1 mm across and the welt was about 1 mm high and 1 cm
across.</p>

<p>Back at the cabin, I put some baking soda / water mix on the bite,
which I have heard will draw out the poison.  It seemed to help.  This
morning the bite was gone, except for the red dot.</p>






<p>This morning we met and Meme and BigDaddy's house, then ate at the cafe inside the grocery store, where I talked at length with Dennis and Kimmie, long-time friends of the family.</p>

<p>Dennis is quite smart.</p>

<p>On the way out of the  store, Wende saw that they sell dry ice.  We bought a cooler and 3 small blocks of dry ice and went across the street to Braums and bought 1 gallon and 3 pints of Braums ice cream, a pint of which will go to Sharri at Wende's work.</p>

<p>Sharri and Wende like Braum's ice cream.</p>

<p>On the way home now, I'm teaching Wende the Alphabet Game that Fred and I know!  She has successfully recited up to P, and I just taught her Q and R.  So awesome!</p>

<p>We just stopped in Vernon, Texas to let Wende change into her overalls.</p>

<p>As a result of this trip, I am more in love with Wende than ever before.  I've been having an incredible great time with her!</p>
