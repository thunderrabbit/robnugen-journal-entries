<p>You know what?  For the past few days I've had a
craving to play a tremendous game of Silent
Football.</p>

<p>Not tremendous like huge with 75 people playing,
but tremendous like long, for hours and hours of
sleep-deprived-merriment.  It appears that SWUUSI will
be the first opportunity I'll get to have such a
game.</p>

<p>I keep thinking of Ryan M and what he had been
thinking as I was asked to halt his bad accent.  By
bad, I mean obnoxious more than bad.</p>

<p>Miss Pink Club Rocks expressed how Ryan's accent
made her want to hurl (I don't actually remember what
she said, but she wanted him to stop).  Hmmm.</p>

<p>What I didn't know at that moment, as I pondered an
appropriate sanction, was that Ryan was thinking,
"c'mon baby, bring it back; hook me up with the
funniest/best/innovative punishment ever."</p>

<p>"Mr Kisses must use a <em>different</em> accent
each time Mr Kisses speaks."</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>I'm so glad to have thought of the perfect
solution.  Or at least a darn funny one.  Ryan liked
it too.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why this pleases me so much.  But it
does.  And I just want more such Silent Football
insanity to laugh and play and prove that YRUU
rocks.</p>

<p>Soon.  Soon.  Coming soon to a cabin near you.</p>
