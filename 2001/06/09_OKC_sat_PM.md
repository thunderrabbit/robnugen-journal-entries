<p class=date>1:53 pm</p>

<p>Awake now.</p>

<p>My neck and back are so tight; I'm going to call Kathy Fey, my
massage therapist to make an appointment.</p>

<p>It's a ghosttown outside. (?)</p>

<p>Fuck!  they must all be at the Social Action thing;
I didn't intend to miss that, but I had to sleep. 
Dammit.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Report from Kathy Fey in Houston:  West Gray was
under water.  That's *fucking* high ass water.  If
West Gray was under water, a ton of other streets were
under water.  I've never previously seen or heard of
water that deep in Houston.</p>

<p>18 wheelers were floating on I-10 at TC Jester</p>

<p>Cars were parked on the sidewalk at Starbucks to
get out of the water on the street.</p>

<p>I-45 was closed last night at Conroe.  (I told her, <em>'we
know'</em> and briefed our story)</p>

<p>The radar shows more water to come.</p>

<p>That's all I can remember that she said.</p>

<p class=date>3:57 pm</p>

<p>We are fully back from the social action; I'm so thankful that
someone knew where they went, and that Tori's mom knew how to get
there!  She drove and I worked about an hour. I helped Grantly and
Emma move a pile of rocks and then helped throw away the
backstop.</p>

<p>This backstop has had a history with us: Two years ago we moved it
from outside the track to inside the track.  Last year we moved the
other backstop, but it fell to pieces and got thrown away.  This year
we cut to pieces and threw away the original backstop.</p>

<p>My feet feel a bit worn.  The asphalt was a bit hot.  We took
pictures of the group by the sign out front of the building.  As we
drove by the sign later, we saw that it said "UNITARIAN YOUTH ARE
UPER!"  It was an electronic marquee, so it hadn't been vandalized.
It just wasn't working correctly.</p>

<p class=date>4:02 pm</p>

<p>Funny exchange between Debu and Amber:</p>

<p>"MMMOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!   Please
PUHLEASE  PlEASE MOMMY puhlease please"</p>

<p>"Rob, she wants her clothes out of the car.  tell
her, she's fifteen"</p>

<p>"You're fifteen, you can't wear clothes.  What?  What does her
being fifteen have to do with wearing clothes?"</p>

<p>"Mommmyy please!!!"</p>

<p>"She wants me to go get them."</p>

<p>"Oh!!!!  Amber!!!!  You can get your own clothes
out of the car; you're fifteen!"</p>

<p>Amber took the keys, "fine I'll go get them."</p>

<p>Just as Amber was leaving, Debbie yelled, "Amber Jo!"</p>

<p>"Deborah .. Dawn!"</p>

<p>"While you're there will you get me.."</p>

<p>"No!" and she strutted out the door.</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAAH!</p>

<p class=date>4:11 pm</p>

<p>Now I'm chilling with Scottie H, who is DJing with
a spread of CDs all over the table.</p>

<p class=date>8:32 pm Saturday</p>

<p>Phat Pat and I have just written a great skit for
the talent show.</p>

<p>Holy  fuckin shit.  Susie just said that the water
is up to the  bridges over Highway 59.  I Want to see
it!!!  WOW!!  Those bridges are like 15 feet high and
I have *never* seen any more than a few inch puddle on
the freeway below them.</p>

<p>Elizabeth and I are about to call Wende.</p>

<p class=date>11:33 pm</p>

<p>Booty dance music and Dane bursts onto the scene wearing a sleek
sleek black vinyl shiny outfit and does this crazy Dane Dance that is
not the normal bouncing around, but it includes dancing standing on
his hands.  His name is now "Richter" and he has a german accent it
seems..</p>

<p>Laura is great.</p>

<p>there is a rip in the ass of his vinyl pants (it's
polyuerythane (sp)) held together only by duct tape</p>

<p class=date>12:04 am Sunday 10 June 2001</p>

<p>Frank just showed Laura and me FruityLoops, a phat
beat editor (beat = the bassline for techno songs)
that is even cooler than my keyboard.</p>

<p>Grantly has just performed in drag to a screaming
crowd in the dining hall.  Wow.</p>

<p>Lisa O (advisor) is reading tarot cards for Natalie B.</p>

<p class=date>12:23 am</p>

<p>Worship now, and I am intrigued to see that Christina is sitting by
Elizbeth.  Unrequited Love is the worship activity now.</p>

<p class=date>2:32 am</p>

<p>Just got to see Susanne K and Melissa C, who came to say HI and
perform Rocky Raccoon in Steve F's absence.  So great to see them, and
how great to hear that Susanne is a pilot now!  She can fly Cessnas.
Nice.  Only $75/hour to rent one and she can fly it for us!!  How
funny/awesome to hear that Melissa has set up an alias to her long
email address at school by setting up a distribution list with only
her name in the list.  :-)</p>

<p>Dane is playing quite an intriguing single string bowed instrument
thing with a stick attached to a shaker.  Quite cool.  Quite odd.
Quite Dane.</p>

<p>I am predicting this will be the last talent and then we'll play
Silent Football.</p>
