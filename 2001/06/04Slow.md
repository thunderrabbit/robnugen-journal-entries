<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>I just wrote a journal entry and then it
mysteriously vanished from my editor and I don't know
how it vanished and I couldn't get it back.</p>

<p>The dumbest thing about it is that the entry was
all, "today has been going slower than I wanted, and I
keep getting sidetracked by email and reading journal
entries, except I'm not getting email and no one is
writing journal entries."</p>

<p>What a dumber way to make things even more slow
than to have to type a journal entry twice to get it
on my site once.</p>

<p>So the point is, "<em>Blah.</em>" and I'm looking
forward to OKC Rally, but am trying not to get lost in
the piles of happy memories from tons of past rallies.
 I enjoy YRUU at least as much as my awesome youth
do!</p>

<p>Then I was all, "oh my gosh!! It's Elise's
birthday!  Elise is one of my newfound step sisters. 
She's my dad's girlfriend's daughter.  But I don't
have her email address."</p>

<p>But I'm not going to write all that again just to
point out that I can't contact her easily.  Blah Blah
Blah.</p>

<p>So the only thing to do is get back to testing my
code and progress slowly and steadily, keeping track
of all the things to keep track of and shit like
that.</p>

<p>Bye.</p>
