<p class=date>12:55 pm Wednesday 13 June 2001</p>

<p>Just finished lunch; they have a cafeteria here for the employees
of SAS, and we got our own table with our own waitstaff (1 person,
apparently the chef) and I correctly identified the ingredients of a
shredded fruit medly: carrots, jicama, apple, ginger, plus a cherry
tomato and slice of avacado.  Most people didn't like this, but I
enjoyed it.  A bit too much ginger though.</p>

<p>Class has been pretty straightforward yet positively reinforcing of
stuff that would have taken me longer to figure out alone.</p>

<p class=date>1:09 pm</p>

<p>Heh.  I just added a where clause to the dataset.  Nice.</p>

<p class=date>1:33 pm</p>

<p>We are zipping through the class and we might even get most of
Friday off!</p>

<p>He said he won't tell our bosses, and that we won't get any money
back.</p>

<p class=date>2:06 pm </p>

<p>Afternoon break now; I called in to work because Dave had a
question.  His question proved that he doesn't know how the G3 works.
This means that we need more training on G3, and that Dave doesn't pay
attention when I tell him how it works.  Grr.</p>

<p class=date>4:02 pm</p>

<p>I've come across a weird thing on my computer, and the instructor
is helping me solve it, but secretly I just want to go home.</p>

<p class=date>5:30  pm</p>

<p>I left and went to Wende's aunt Nancy's work/business and hung out
for a bit and then went to Stacy and Rodd's.  Dinner now.</p>

<p class=date>10:00 pm</p>

<p>Got <em>Totally</em> ridiculously lost on the way to Sally's to go
out to downtown tonight.  Meeting her friend Valerie who has never
been to Antone's.  I'm about an hour late getting here I got so lost.
Took a tour including 2244, lost creek blvd, barton springs, 2244
again, 360, Mopac, Wm Cannan (sp), I 35, 15th st, Lamar, Brazos,
Lavaca, and finally here.</p>

<p>When I was at Wm Cannon and 35, I called the girl at KVRX and asked
which way to go on 35 to get to downtown.</p>

<p>'North.'</p>

<p>'You are the best!  Thank you so much.'</p>

<p>I was pretty much way farther south than I had guessed.  Wow.</p>
