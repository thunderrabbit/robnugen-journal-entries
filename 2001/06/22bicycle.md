<p>I rode my bike from work to the bike shop during rush hour
traffic.  I mustly just hauled ass on the sidewalk beside traffic and
had no incidents except for one.  I zipped off a curb just as a truck
was turning left off the street onto the street I was crossing.  I
skidded, turned, and stopped in time, but I fell off my bike in the
process.  Bonked my left knee.</p>

<p>At the bike shop I picked up my light which simply had a wire
disconnected.  They fixed it for free.  I talked to Jeff who
encouraged me to bring the bike in for 30 day checkup on Sunday.  I'll
do that.  I've given it a pretty good thrashing.</p>

<p>Did I tell you I dented the back rim?  I did.  Flew off a curb and
the chain bounced so my pedals spun forward and I had no leverage to
jump up the next curb.  I lifted the front wheel up, but the back
wheel went <b><em>B O N K</em></b> against the curb.  It rides fine,
but is slightly dented.  They might be able to undent it.</p>
