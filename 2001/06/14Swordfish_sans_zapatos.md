<p>Aunt Nancy and I just saw Swordfish starring the supa cool John
Travolta as a 'terrorist hating zealot' (Nancy) or a 'precise
heartless psycho' (Rob).  Pretty good movie, I thought; Nancy is
thumbs down: too predictable with unecessary violence ('and I don't
mind necessary violence') and gratuitous nudity, though Halle looked
good.</p>

<p>I say 'wow,' to whoever's gross mind wrote the hostage bombing
scene, and the flying was pretty unexpected.</p>

<p>The guys on KVRX's News Rant show are <em>funny</em>.  I'm enious
that they get to be all funny and take calls on the air!!!</p>

<p>Going swimming with Sally now.</p>

<p>Oh.  before seeing Swordfish, I noticed that I had left my shoes at
the training center, 15 miles away.  Luckily, they didn't care; I got
to watch a movie while barefoot!!  Yay Austin!!  My kinda town!.</p>

<p>We bought some of the Adidas sandals, which really I have wanted
for quite a while so that we could go eat at Chango's, which, by the
way, they joked about on The News Rant, and I called them and
hopefully was pretty funny on the air. </p>
