<p>How fucking cool!!!  Wow wow wow.  I just called KVRX, 91.7fm in
Austin and (they can take calls on the air!) talked to the DJ a bit
about supporting KVRX because "this is not quite exactly true, but
<em>all</em> the other radio stations are ultimately owned by about 5
cats who dictate all the music, which is why every radio station
across the whole US sounds exactly the same!!"</p>

<p>He asked what I was doing in Austin, and I told him I was learning
SAS, a wacky language that psychology grad students would know, etc,
and it was cool to just hang out with him briefly on the air.</p>

<p>"Support 91.7 in Houston <em>and</em> in Austin cause it's so
important that these stations stay on the air.  Turn your radio up and
tell all your friends!"</p>

<p>And then the even funnier thing was the next caller was all, "Yes,
I would like to buy your radio station."</p>

<p>"Okay, who is this?"</p>

<p>"This is Rupert."</p>

<p>"Are you one of the 5 cats who own all the other radio
stations?"</p>

<p>"Of course not!  I could buy each of them ten times over.  I just
want to purchase your radio station.  I think you'll find my offer
quite generous."</p>

<p>They rambled for a bit, and it was pretty funny, especially when
"Rupert's" accent changed.</p>

<p>"Hey, your accent has changed."</p>

<p>"Yes, well, It's early in the morning."</p>

<p>"You started with an australian accent and have shifted to a
brooklyn accent."</p>

<p>"Let me know when I turn Mexican."</p>

<p>Very funny.  Hilariously funny!</p>

<p>Woah.  In this made-up data there is a person named Debbie Barnes!
But this person is from North Carolina.</p>

<p>Wow.  We are getting into much more intriguing code things now.
Nice.</p>

<p>Lunchtime now.</p>
