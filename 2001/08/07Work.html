<p>Work is stinky in that I keep getting stuck doing
stupid stuff. And one of our clients sent an email on
Friday to Dennis, requesting something, and Dennis did
1/2 of the request and forwarded it to me only today.
</p>

<p>I called the client and apologized; it was too late
to do the next part of the request.</p>

<p>We are likely to open the site and get this
person's feedback and then run the reports for
her.</p>

<p>I don't *think* the reports have already been run,
but the point is that we have to do extra crap to make
it happen.</p>
