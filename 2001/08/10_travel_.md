Subject: bigger can of worms

A real project manager type person could be super duper most excellent.
There's a part of me who just wants someone to handle/balance the incoming
stuff and prioritize it, and tell me what needs to be worked on.

However,

The big thing that I'm afraid to say/suggest is that I *really* want to
travel and ride my bike across the US and/or Europe and around the perimeter
of Australia.  (Ultimately, I want to shift my career to leading youth group
tours to Europe, Australia, etc.  Maybe just during the summer, when they
are out of school.)

G3 is not *quite* in a state where I can feel happy leaving it, but I think
it's close.  And I'm not suggesting that I actually leave bye-bye
permanently.

But I am open to the idea of taking time off without pay.  I'm considering a
month total off next year.   1 week in February (to learn Spanish
intensively in Mexico), 2 weeks in June for wedding etc, 1 week in July for
youth camp.

And, I am open to the idea of time off as part of my salary (so $$ stays
constant over the span of the year, but I get more vacation)..

Right now I'm only writing to you, Karla (but feel free to talk to Kevin if
you want); I have a great deal of fear about

1) reaction from others ("Why is Rob treated differently?")
2) fear that I won't be *able* to ride across Europe or the US
3) other random feelings that I can't pinpoint

I *love* the work environment here.  It's more than just not having to wear
shoes.  The energy is great.  The win-win solutions/attitudes are great.

I am pretty sure I could be making 20-30k more per year somewhere else, but
this place is great.

Big sigh.   Thank you.

I think that the idea of you leaving for 4 weeks next year is not out of the
question as long as we plan it in advance.  Don't worry about people
thinking Rob is being treated differently.  We try to treat each person
differently and don't mind it at all.  You are becoming a big part of the
company.  You are taking on a load and it is wonderful to have you here.  I
agree that you could be making more elsewhere - I hope that it will pay off
for you in the future - as well as now - enjoying the 'energy'.  I think
that you are a wonderful person to have around - not just for your
programming, but also for your attitude towards feedback.  We should all be
using you as our role model on that characteristic.  Patrick and I have
been talking about planning a little company one day - timeout.  We might do
some fun things- but also, want to do some planning for our growth so that
things are not quite as spur of the moment as they are now.  I hope you grow
more into the role of seeing yourself as one of the builders of the company
and think of it as your company to build.

You also have tremendous integrity and can continue to help by being a truth
speaker.

Deep sigh!

K.
