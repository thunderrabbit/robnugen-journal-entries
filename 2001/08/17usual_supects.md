<p>After watching the monkey movie, Dude and I watched
The Usual Suspects on DVD at his house.  This was a
*much* better film than the other; the plot was
meaningful and made sense, the story lined up properly
in the end.</p>

<p>When Veronica arrived home, we summarized the
Monkey plot.  She was glad to have not seen it with
us.</p>

<p>Oh, speaking of people not having seen the monkey
movie, when Dude and I left the theater, Kristen and
Catherine (sp) were out in the lobby!!  Catherine
agreed that it was a terrible movie; Kristen still
wanted to see it.  If she did, I hope she enjoyed
it.</p>
