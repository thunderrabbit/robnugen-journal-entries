<p>Relatively happy today; busy busy at work, but
getting some good stuff done.  I discovered a huge
gaping security hole in the G3.  That will be quite
effectively patched in the new version, due to come
out tomorrow (! yikes !)</p>

<p>Ate at Mission Burrito with Wende tonight.</p>

<p>There's more going on, but like some of my peeps on
livejournal, I'm choosing to not disclose each detail
of my life.</p>
