<p>I just chatted with Laura, and discovered what 5 languages I want to
learn:</p>

<pre>
rob: French is not on my top 5 languages to learn, I don't think.  Maybe it
is.
rob: Spanish,
rob: ASL
rob: Japanese
rob: German
rob: French
rob: ah, it is.
laura: aha!
rob: English & Spanish should get me pretty far in the western world and
Europe
rob: ASL because it's cool as shit
rob: Japanese because it's a challenge & 1/2, and cool as shit
rob: German and French to begin my European language conquest
</pre>

<p>So nice to have goals!</p>
