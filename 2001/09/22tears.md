I'm cryin crying crying this whole week just feels fucking
pointless wllike what the fuck and I doing and this is all
menaingliess and aI just don't fucking know what tod  do.  Tears
aren't eavevne coming out t I'm just crying and no tears . so stupid
why why is this so difficult?  

I just want to feel valuable in this world.  I just want peole to like
me in this world.  Why amd I so scared of marrying wende?  she loves
me she thinks I'm valuable this must be a totally different issue.

Is that right/  marrying wende is a diffiernt issue than if I feel
valuable or not?

maybe.

Every one is all tellin gme that the world doesnt work the way I want
it to work that everyithing isn't a cake ride and all fun adnd fucking
games, and fucking-games, but I think the worlsd can be a better
easier place, but then what would be the point?

do I really think that I should have it all figured out by now?  

No, I just want to fell loved in the world and just want to have
experiences in the world

isn't this an experience that your'e having right now/  maybe ist's
the case that you simply b could be present where you are in the world
and realize that your'evae having all kinds of experieinces all the
time.  maybe.

I ate; it was good; I feel better.  Cleaned up some shit around the
kitchen

Oh, while I was talking to Meredith, or while she was talking to me
trying to give me advice, but just talking about her own marriage, I
cleaned a lot of shit off my desk in the study.  looks good.  almost
perfectly clean.

Going to KTRU soon; might stop by work first, if not, I'll stop by
work afterward.  Gotta put some shit online.  small fixes.
