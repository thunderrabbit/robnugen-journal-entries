<p>I cried at work today; felt inadequate and attacked and unprofessional
and all kinds of crappy stuff.  I tried to hide it with my hoodie pulled up
like Ben Kenobi, but I doubt it worked too much considering we were all
sitting around the conference room table.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if we're going to make it.</p>
