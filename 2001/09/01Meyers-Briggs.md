<p class=date>12:05 pm Saturday 1 September 2001 </p>

<p>Just went to the Myers-Briggs personality type workshop.  Before I fell asleep (for the first time at the rally), I learned that I am ENFP.  Specifically,</p>

<p>E slight
<br>N clear
<br>F moderate
<br>P clear</p>

<p>By far, most people were ENFP.  She said ENFP was indicative of UU tendencies.</p>

<p>According to the workbook, ENFP is:</p>

<p class=message>Warmly enthusiastic and imaginative.  See life as full of possibilities.  Make connections between events and information very quickly, and confidently proceed based on the patterns they see.  Want a lot of affirmation from others, and readily give appreciateion and support.  Spontaneous and flexible, often rely on their ability to improvise and their verbal fluency.</p>

<p>According to the other handout she gave us, (and that she wrote), the middle two letters indicate a spiritual path-type.</p>

<p>NF personality type: the journey of harmony:</p>

<p><ol><li>The quest toward authentic, actualized self-hood.</li>
<li>Mystical harmony</li>
<li>A life attitude of expectany</li>
<li>The importance of openness to healing and the place of the dream in this process.</li>
<li>Social idealism</li>
<li>Focus on the process in relationships, familial and social.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Mentors for this journey:
<br><ul><li>Rabindranath Tagore</li>
<li>Jesus of Nazareth (especially look at Jesus: <em>A Revolutionary Biography</em> by John Dominic Crossan)</li></ul></p>

<p>Right now Steve and Ryan are playing Beatles tunes on guitar.  Bryn knows most of the songs; I know very few.</p>
