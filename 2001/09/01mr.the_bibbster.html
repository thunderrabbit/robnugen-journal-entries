<p>sean talks about the day...</p>

<p class=message>good disc just now. i love goin up with tanner and not hurting myself!
earlier there was a 'fishbowl' but the leader of this thing didnt know what a fishbowl was so it was kinda screwy. i sat next to Steve. he took some good notes that i wanna read later. it was about the  2 new rules. and how people dont like them or whatever. i'm sure Rob wrote about it.  well my weekend is all coming together, right now i'm listening to Steve play the guitar and singing beatles. well  i guess i'll go give Rob his Visor back. p.s. my visor doesnt work with the keyboard cause of some driver buuuull-sheet. and our visors dont like to beam to eachother.
<br>Rob likes oatmeal rasin cookies.</p>
