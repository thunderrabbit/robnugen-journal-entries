<p>I don't know what the fuck is going on exactly, but there are some rumors that Tulsa adults are "monitoring" this rally to determine if the Tulsa  Adults want the Tulsa Youth to attend any more district level events.  That is a rumor.</p>

<p>For some reason, we advisors have been asked to attend a lunch thing and let me tell you it is a fucking disgrace as I first lay eyes on this.  fucking <em>plates</em> fucking silver ware and a fucking table cloth and glasses and a fucking gift bag in each seat.
Not knowing WTF is going on, I'm immediately assuming these gifts are for us advisors.  I'm pissed.  I feel bribed.</p>

<p>The meeting hasn't even started yet, and the youth are down in the cafeteria eating sloppy lasagna on paper plates and they are looking up at us on the balcony going, "why are you up there?"  "are you better than us?"  They are asking in jest, but behind each joke is a bit of truth.</p>

<p>What The Fuck is going on??</p>

<p>I don't want to meet these people who have set up the lunch.  I want to tell them, you all are a bunch of idiots. This is not youth empowerment.  This is a tragedy to YRUU.</p> 

<p>These youth are precious fabulous people who are simply learning their place and way and means in life.  The rally is a sacred event that allows them to bond and interact and communicate and learn and create and without them I would not be 1 inch involved in UUism.  Really.  Really.</p>

<p>meeting now begins.</p>

<p class=date>2:15 pm</p>

<p>I left the meeting, which was not actually even a meeting, but just a condoned exclusive adisor lunch thing.  We were invited to introduce ourselves and tell how many youth we brought.  I went approximately last, and said, "the best thing about those 3 vans and those 18 youth coming was that the youth organized the whole thing.  The youth got the vans; the youth figured out how many people needed to go; the youth got drivers.  The youth are empowered and capable of doing amazing things."</p>

<p>There was no 'agenda' in the meeting, so I left and played disc with Sean.</p>

<p>We are in a fishbowl now; non Tulsa peeps talking, expressing our concerns.</p>

<p>In the fishbowl, I said as clearly and gently as possible, "I felt sad and pulled away from the community during the lunch.  Like it was condoned exclusive behavior.  I'm here for the youth.  I'm not here for the adults; I basically don't talk to the adults."</p>

<p>Chris says, "I have 189 youth on my list; I want my youth to attend the rallies.  There's no reason that I can't have 90 youth at rallies.  ...  Our problem is that we're not providing anything meaningful to them.   When I look at it as something new to them; 98% of what happens here is meaningful and powerful, but it gets pulled down by what the other 182 kids I've got find offensive.</p>

<p>"I want to speak with the youth who are not here; to see how we can bring them back."</p>

<p>Tanner: "You can't achieve your spirituality by crushing someone else's."  and "This is a church." and "This is a community and we need to respect the community."</p>

<p>Chris: "Each church has its own values; we're asking you to respect our church's values.   This has been a fantastic crowning success because we are having this discussion now.  So we can have the conversation that asks 'are we doing what is buildng our collective ministry.'"</p>

<p>Outside youth are now commending the Tulsa group on great rally, but wonder about when the repression will stop.</p>

<p>Ian: "I haven't been going around sying the fuck-word."</p>

<p>Steve Feinstein rules.  He <em>proved</em> in one quick zing that adults have Adult Power just because they are adults.  Excellent job, Steve!!</p>
