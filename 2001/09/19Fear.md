<p>I have a fear that we're going to start shooting a
bunch of missles at a bunch of islams, and then 'a
terrorist' will release some anthrax or some other
biological germ agent in a couple of big cities in the
US.</p>

<p>That would suck.</p>

<p>There is a vaccine for anthrax, but according to
some websites, it's only 20% effective if given in
large doses once symptoms appear.  According to other
websites, the only company that makes the vaccine was
sanctioned for non-quality work.</p>
