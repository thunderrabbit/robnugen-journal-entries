<p>In the youth forum now; it's almost over.

<p>Chris: "We have done a really lousy job in our job in our church of telling our kids who they are."</p>

<p>I can see that they are trying to have good values in the rally, but I and others argue that UUism specifically <em>*does not tell people who they are*</em>.</p>

<p>I fell asleep while outside at the worship.  I told Sean to wake me up whenever for Silent Football.</p>

<p>That was around midnightish I think.</p>

<p>No one woke me up, except I woke myself up at 4:30am and wandered around, wondering what happened to Silent Football.</p>
