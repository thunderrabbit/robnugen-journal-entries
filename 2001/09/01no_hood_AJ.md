<p>Chillin' by Sean in the sponge room now.  We just looked through Vessy's pics from SWUUSI.  They are *SO* good.  Not just the pics, but they are all perfectly labeled.  Every person in every picture is named.  That is such aluable dedication now that will be so appreciated forever to come.</p>

<p>Sean is signing it now; I will in a second.</p>

<p class=message>AJ's hood is gone. here is the story....
so AJ is on the highway doin maybe 75 in a 70 right? ok well this jerk behind him desides to ride his ass really hard. and he's goin pretty fast. he is speeding put to like 80 at some points.  hmmm...so AJ has to speed up right? right, but there is a grey van ahead of him doin 60 so that isn't an option. but then the car behind him drops back and changes lanes, but he is still close. so AJ is thinkin he'll pass the grey van and him....but no. hmm ok. 'i'm sick of this' he's gonna dart ahead of the car behind him and speed past the van leaing the whole mess in his wake. so he gets in the left lane. when SNAP-CRACKLE-POP!! his HOOD flies up over the window and bend so that it is formfitting the car's profile. there is one small triangle of a peephole  in the bottom driverside windshield that he can look out of!  so he's goin 80 trying to get out of this asshole's way and he can't see for shit. thank god he's not dead. really. he pulls over on the sholder and has to rip it off. rip rip rip.. ok it comes off!! Rob and I and some others were like 'what did you do?? '</p>

<p>'i threw it into the median and stomped the shit out of it!!' haha he threw it in the median (where it is no longer) and jumped on it. well do you blame him?? think of the adrenilne. he said that he put his arm up to shield his face from the glass but it didn't break. thank yaweh.</p>
