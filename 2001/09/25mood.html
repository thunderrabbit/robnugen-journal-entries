<p>Haven't really been in the mood to write.  Not even writing letters
lately, nor email.  Doing a lot of personal work; getting the sadness
out, experiencing it as needed.</p>

<p>My Higher Self suggested that I cry each night.  Or at least be
aware of my emotions as well as I can.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's hard.  Uncomfortable to just sit and be still with
myself.  Like Alanis' song "Isn't it ironic" reference to Silence.
Oookey.</p>

<p>One step at a time.</p>
