<p>I just learned that Sean rescued two shirts without 'CON' from the trash.</p>

<p>Scott just asked if I was writing about him.  I said yes.</p>

<p>OH!!!  The whole reason I'm writing:</p>

<p>On the way over here from the rally to Denny's, Mark took off his shirt.  With that funny Mark smile, he sat just without his shirt saying "Fuck  hheheheheheheheh fuck fuck heheheheh ass heheheheheh fuck hehehhehehehheheh shit fuck fucker heheheheheheh."</p>

<p>I was laughing so hard so funny so hilarous!</p>

<p>He got out and Scott got out and Ryan and Dan got out of their respective cars, all wearing no shirts and going, "life is fucking great,"  "I feel so fucking free!"</p>

<p>Sean:</p>

<p class=message>Rob butters his pancake (singular) with butter so that the top changes color from dark brown to weird creamy whipped butter color. he cuts them up like fingers and pours syrup over the fingers carefully not letting any get on the plate. then he declares that he will make it a morphious strip. so he folds a pancake strip into a half-twist circle and starts to rip it in two. rip. rip. ri-nope. it doesnt work to well, it starts to fall apart and he goes "ahhh it's falling apart!!" i say "that's because it's a pancake." hahahahaha we all had a good laugh.</p>

<p>sleep now  oh  its about 475 miles from woodlands to tulsa</p>

<p class=date>6:27 pm</p>

<p>We're now leaving Corsicana, where we spent a solid hour and 1/2 munching and chilling and dropping off Paul.  Meg, Natalie, Ryan and I cruised over to Sonic.  Actually Ryan was late because he had to go back to invite Susie to bounce on the moonwalk.  Ryan therefore ordered last, and because he ordered a single onion ring, he got his order first.  Like way first.  He was done eating and had finished digesting before we got our food.</p>

<p>Next project: advertise a pickup game of Silent Football.</p>

<p class=date>10:24 pm</p>

<p>I have just arrived home.  I'm quite excited about the idea of having a pickup Silent Football game.  The idea arrived in my mind when Ryan approached me 1/2 jokingly(?), "Rob, why aren't there any pickup Silent Football games?"</p>

<p>"There may be some, but we just run with the wrong crowds," was my quick funny answer.  But as I think about it, I imagine this could be a pretty cool thing!</p>

<p>Silent Football is a rather entertaining game to watch.  It's funny, innovative, sometimes uproariously hilarious!  We could have a few chairs arranged in a circle at the back of Notsuoh or something, put some lights on and just play.</p>

<p>If we had about 5 people who knew how to play to start the games rolling, we could make it a monthly event.  Every 3rd Friday or something.  Maybe every 2nd Friday so that it would sometimes be Friday the 13th.</p>

<p>SF on SF.  Silent Football on Second Fridays.</p>

<p>We'll see.</p>
