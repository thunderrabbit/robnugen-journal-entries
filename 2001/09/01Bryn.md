<p class=date>4:46 am Saturday 1 September 2001</p>

<p>We arrived around 3:30am I think; and we didn't get lost!!!!</p>

<p>Hugs and hugs and registration and picture for mugbook.</p>

<p>It took Bryn and I a full hour to walk from the ground floor up two levels to find Sean to tell him HI.  We were happily interrupted for hugs and stories and all kinds of good stuff.</p>

<p>Talkin' to Bryn and Sean now.  Bryn knows only 20 people that are registered.</p>

<p>Bryn was all, "I don't want this new 'technologically advanced' Silent Football."</p>

<p>"Would you be willing to simply hear the story of how the were created?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but I won't play."</p>

<p>"That's okay; you'll be graduated soon."</p>

<p>ooohhhhh  I'm just kiddin', well I'm not, actually, but you know.</p>

<p>Bryn helped me study my spanish flash cards.  Studying with friends makes it so much more fun!</p>
