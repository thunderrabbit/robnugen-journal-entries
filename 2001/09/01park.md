<p>We are still at Zilk Park.</p>

<p class=message>Short Term Memory (Sean has to remember this)</p>

<p>Sean put his white touch group bracelet on his cup.  At first glance (for some people) it looks like a big cup stuck inside a small cup.</p>

<p>Two minutes later he tried to pull the big cup out of the small cup.  "Hey, what happened to my cup?"</p>

<p>I thought he was trying to trick me.  "False.  It's your bracelet, silly."</p>

<p>"Ohhhh!!"</p>

<p>We took turns trying to trick different people.  "Try to pull the big cup out.  It's stuck."</p>

<p>About a third would try and a third would be suspicious and then try.  Others  were too suspicious to try.  A couple people took the whole thing and tried to pull them apart.</p>

<p>Danny took one look at it.  "It's a bracelet."  Nice.</p>

<p class=date>Bonk</p>

<p>After Sean and I totally schooled all the low rope course games, we tried a new variation of the walking two by fours.  Basically we were using them as long snowshoes.  We each held a rope to lift them as we lifted our feet.  But the cool variation was that we were beside each other, with our adjacent legs crossing, sorta like a 3 legged race.</p>

<p>Be sure to get that visual; these represent our legs as we are standing:</p>

<pre>
  /\  /\
 /  \/  \
/   /\   \
</pre>

<p>I directed our motion. "Okay, inside legs," and we moved both our inside legs forward.</p>

<p>"Okay, outside legs," and we both shifted our weight to our inside legs and <b>[bonk!!]</b> we knocked our heads together.   "Ow fuck!!!" and fell off the boards in pain and laughter.  Ow ow ow.</p>

<p>It's been at least 15 minutes and my head still has a lump and it hurts.</p>

<p>(It's been 36 hours and my head hurts there if I press on it)</p>
