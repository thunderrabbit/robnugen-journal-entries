<p>The white-bracelet touch group's first task was to cook breakfast on Saturday morning.</p>

<p class=message>For each egg in your recipe substitute 1-1/2 teaspoons Ener-G Egg Replacer mixed thoroughly with 2 tablespoons water, i.e. 1-1/2 teaspoons Ener-G Egg Replacer +  2 tablespoons water=1 egg.</p>

<p>So I was all, "hmm.  I'm not measuring 16 ounces worth of 1.5 teaspoons of egg powder, nor calculating how much water that requires.."  So I poured the vegan-egg-powder into a bowl, and poured a pile of water on it.</p>

<p>Mix mix mix mix mix</p>

<p>Mix mix mix mix mix</p>

<p>Mix mix mix</p>

<p>Mix mix mix mix</p>

<p>Mix</p>

<p>Mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix</p>

<p>It looked like a frothy mixture of water and dish soap.</p>

<p>Hmm.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Poured 1/2 the mixture into a pan.  Cook cook cook cook cook cook cook.</p>

<p>Slowly, the water evaporated, the mix coagulated, everyone watching evacuated, and it came out like a huge white blob of thick Slime.   It was tasteless.  Gross.   Ewwwww.</p>

<p>Turns out, that this stuff is supposed to replace a couple eggs at a time in a <em>mixture of something else</em> that would normally require eggs.  In short, it will replace eggs in any recipe... except eggs.</p>

<p>the pancakes were great.</p>
