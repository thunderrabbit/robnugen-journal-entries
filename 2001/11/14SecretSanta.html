<p>I just saw an email that reminded me that I don't
remember who I picked for my secret santa person for
our Investment Club.  Doh!</p>

<p>Spent only 6 hours at work today and then I ran off
to paint Wende's plate at Paint This!  It's about 1/2
finished at least.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to ride my bike over to Dude's and
watch TechTV while munching pizza and ice cream.  Aww
yeah.  My kinda party!</p>
