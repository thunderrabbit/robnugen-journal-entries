>Quick note concerning accepted photos:
>
> Your photo(s) shares a timeslot with other photos,
> so it might not always come up at the specified time.  If
> the clock has more than one photo for a given time, it chooses
> a picture at random.  If your photo does not come up, hit 
> reload/refresh on your browser during that minute and it
> should come up eventually.  If it doesn't come up at all
> when I said it would, write me and tell me I need to write
> better code or something.
