<p class=date>6:56am Wednesday 23 May 2001</p>

<p>Last night at work I was able to get "back to
work," and even inspired myself enough to do some work
this morning from home.</p>

<p>Wende and I both had the night off last night, and
will for the next several Tuesdays probably, as
Spanish has been moved to Monday nights.  We just went
to bed (and to sleep) early.</p>
