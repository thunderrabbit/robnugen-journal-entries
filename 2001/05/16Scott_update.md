Querida Roberto,

Robnugen.com reports that Scott broke down! Did you
get him fixed? What was wrong?
</pre>

<p>Oops!</p>

<p>That's one thing about journals; stories written in
realtime may not be mentioned after their
resolution!</p>

<p>Scott is fixed.  He had a sore distributor cap and
rotor thing.  That was replaced.  While we were at it,
he got a new valve cover gasket, which should keep him
from leaking in the garage.  (We do still have
cardboard on the floor though in case another leak
appears.)</p>

<p>All for the low low price of $700 or so. 
(including $100 to determine what was the problem with
stalling in the first place.)</p>
