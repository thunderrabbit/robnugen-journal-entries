<p>The storm has passed, and I'm still awake, but now
I have figured out 90% of the tools I would need to
merge my entries here with any entries on my
livejournal.com journal.  I'm still not sure that I
will do it, though.</p>

<p>If I do, I will have to write functionality that
will redesign how the left hand index is set up, and I
will probably have to just rewrite the entire
script.</p>

<p>We shall see.</p>
