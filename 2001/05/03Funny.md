Hello,

Have you participated in the Upward Feedback Survey yet?

If so, thank you.  If not or if you wish to provide more feedback

Each survey takes about 15 minutes to complete and is completely
anonymous and confidential.  Upward Feedback benefits you, your
colleagues, and the firm.

· You benefit by encouraging positive management and leadership styles
· Your colleagues benefit from your encouragement to enhance their
  strengths and identify areas for coaching
· The firm benefits by continuously developing the highest quality
leadership

Refer to the email you received from [us] last April 15/16
