<p class=date>1:28pm Tuesday 22 May 2001</p>

<p>On Friday, Molly sent me this link: <a
href="https://www.cadenhead.org/book/java2412/lottomad.html">https://www.caden
head.org/book/java2412/lottomad.html</a>.  It simulates a lottery in a java
applet, allowing the user to choose 6 numbers between 1 and 50, inclusive.
The applet simulates playing the lottery twice a week every week until one
wins big.  It generates random lottery numbers and keeps track of the number
of 3-of-6, 4-of-6, 5-of-6, and 6-of-6 matches one gets.  If one matches all
6 numbers, it stops.</p>

<p>Minh and I started the applet at the same moment on our respective
computers, and bet a quarter on who would win the most by 10am Monday.  If
we tied at zero on 6 of 6, then we see who has the most 5-of-6.  If that's a
tie, then check 4-of-6 etc.</p>

<p>At 10am Monday, he had won:</p>

<p><table border=1>
<tr><td>who </td><td>3 of 6</td><td>4 of 6</td><td>5 of 6</td>
    <td>6 of 6</td><td>paid      </td><td>years </td></tr>
<tr><td>Minh</td><td>42690 </td><td>2386  </td><td>44    </td>
    <td>0     </td><td>$2,570,529</td><td>24,716</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rob </td><td>42788 </td><td>2200  </td><td>31    </td>
    <td>0     </td><td>$2,5M     </td><td>24,600</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>My $ paid and years played are not as precise because I haven't stopped
my lottery simulator yet.  Here's the email I just sent to Molly.</p>

<p><pre>
I've been playing 34 thousand years and haven't won big yet.

Drew said 3-of-6 pays $5.

I don't know how to guesstimate the 4-of-6 and 5-of-6 payouts, but I'll
guess 100 and 1000, respectively.

Then I've won approximately
59000 * $   5  ~ $300,000
3050  * $ 100  ~ $305,000
50    * $1000  ~ $ 50,000
                --------
                 $655,000

Even if 5-of-6 pays $10,000, I've only won $500,000 more or a $1.1M, though
I've paid $3.5M

Here's the result from the person who told me about the link.



Alright -- I just got back to my desk and running lottery simulation after a
day away -- it must be some 4-5 days now that I've been running it.

After 23,000 simulated years, and 2.4 million drawings, it appears that I've
won the jackpot! So I suppose that lotteries aren't such a ridiculous
proposition, for those with longevity in their families and persistence in
their character...

Of course, I suppose that one would have had to spend $2.4 million just
playing the lottery for so long, too... (admittedly, you would have won some
small sums along the way, to help defray that.)

I am hoping the subject line will make you think I won the java lottery over
the weekend.  I did not.

It's played 24 thousand years.  I've won 30 5-of-6, 2163 4-of-6 and 42141
3-of-6.

I imagine since there are only 50 numbers to choose from, it's a 1 in 45
chance to get 6 of 6 each time I get 5 of 6, so I should be closing in on
the big win.  (should be, if probability became more likely to win the more
times I don't)

Only $2.52M dollars spent!
