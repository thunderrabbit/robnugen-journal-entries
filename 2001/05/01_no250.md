<p>Well, I haven't heard back from the lawyer guy who
apparently needed an expert witness.  Maybe he didn't
need anyone after all.  Maybe he found someone
already.  Maybe it was because I used a handwritten
cover sheet for the fax.</p>

<p>Work is okay; I did a conference call with some
peeps who are selling the G3 to some other peeps, just
figuring out what features to change, etc.</p>

<p>The conference call was from 10am to 11am or so.  I
haven't done much else since then.  Some days I'm an
extreme programmer, some days I'm just chillin'.</p>
