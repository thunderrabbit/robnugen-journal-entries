<p class=dream>Being held hostage in a jungle, by a man who had a sekeleton in a bamboo cage on the ground, and a new prisoner and me in his hut.  When we arrived, he said that the skelton had been watched witha web cam since 1800 in a cathedral in France or something.</p>

<p class=dream>The skeleton moved, and actually was completely animated, a robotic skelton with metalic bones.  I sat quetly in one corner of the hut faking like a good prisoner, not trying to get away, not scared as the bad guy and the skeleton bantered.  The skeleton secretly hated the bad guy and wanted to kill him, but pretended to enjoy his company.</p>

<p class=dream>The other prisoner was clearly scared and the bad guy was focusing a lot of attention on him in a psychological scary way.  Finally the bad guy walked right up to me and was all staring into my eyes, and I gazed cooly at him, and asked , "como estas?" the familiar version of how are you?  I recognized he was Jim Rose.</p>

<p class=dream>He looked slightly surprised, then "most excellent and then the equivalent of maniacal laughter as he left me alone.  He stepped outside and the skeleton picked up a pick (like for digging in a mine - a big pick) and was going to swing it into the bad guy's back.  The skeleton never did it though, and hid the pick in a suitcase on the ground as the bad guy came back in.</p>

<p class=dream>I said, " notice some koalas in the big tree outside.  He was all, "really?  and ran back out to look.  Sure enough, there were four baby koalas and their mother.  Also heard some monkeys hollering, but I didn't know what kind they were.   I asked the bad gu and he told me.</p>

<p class=dream>I realized it was a dream and I was trying to write it down, but Wende kept talking.  I told her, please, let mejust write this down, but she kept talking even thought she said, "okay."  After several tries, and I could feel te dream slipping away, I started to cry, and she still kept talkng, I realized I was still dreaming.</p>

<p>So I gently woke up for real and wrote this down.</p>
