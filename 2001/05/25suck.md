<p>This sucked.</p>

<p>Bottom line is some clients' comments were not
being saved, after I added code to make sure that
users couldn't lose data by double-clicking submit, or
by clicking submit before the page is displayed.</p>

<p>After I installed the fix, I did test it; the
comments showed up on the page.  What I didn't do was
click [save] and see if they *still* showed up on the
page.   The code works for certain now.  I have tested
it several times.</p>

<p>I have been super careful to make sure all the data
was restored correctly; it took me 5 hours to restore
it from our web logs.</p>

<p>I started at 3:30, after a not super busy (gently
productive) day.  I was hoping to be home when Wende
got home.  I'm going home now.  :-)</p>
