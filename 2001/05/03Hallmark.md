giving them a link here because of their funny funny
ad!</p>

HI

I just saw your TV commercial advertising
that moms can get a million dollars if we
buy cards for them.  That's all fine, but
what I *really* liked about the commercial
was the ending:

Mom, coaching soccer or something (after
having won a million dollars):  "Great Game!
Let's go get pizza!"

Then for a single second, we see what could
be an ad for an airline, but it's actually
the punchline on your commercial:  an airplane
flying marked "AIR ITALY"

The mom is flying them to Italy for pizza!

What I most appreciate is that the commercial
appears to be finished, and then offers a
quick punchline to those who are paying
attention.  The punchline is not belabored;
it's quick and succinct.  Most excellent!!!
