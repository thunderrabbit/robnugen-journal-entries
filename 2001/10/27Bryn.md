Remember the loving feeling of wanting so much for Bryn to feel
comfortable with her decision about whether or not to attend ACT class
tomorrow in the AM (in 3 hours or so) maybe 5 hours.  Hug hug hug and
just so much love expressed for her.  I Love You sign as I said bye to
her.  She was on the phone in the kitchen and I left for bed.

Absolutely precious when I talked to Bryn deep meaningful
convesation where she queried me about relationship with Wende and i
answered as best I could.

She told me about her feelings and sadness lately since she's been
back in USA and stuff.  Seems that one of her life's greatest fears is
having people leave her.  I felt so belssed by her precious tears; I
know it is difficult for Bryn to cry in front of others.

Bryn and I talked all the way until the entire rally was leaving
for Social Action.  So blessed I felt getting to hang out with her
even longer.
