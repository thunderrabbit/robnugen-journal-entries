<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">Tragedy has shocked us
into an examination 
of the way this nation of peace and freedom does
business in the world. 
Terrorism used to happen in distant places. Now,
explosions of death 
and destruction have rocked us to the core.
</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">Grief mingles with
fury. No country deserved 
such an act of terrorism. Where is God now? Where is
Allah? Where is 
Yhwh? Why don’t they do
something?</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">A Sufi was praying when
along came a 
cripple, a beggar and a victim of assault. And seeing
them, he cried, 
“Great God, how is it that a loving creator can see
such things and 
yet do nothing about them?” And God said, “I did do
something. I made 
you.”</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">OK, God, what are we to
do now? Retaliate? 
Assassinate? Give up our freedom? We expect some
combination of responses. 
These attacks demand increased vigilance as well as a
strong show of 
force. I am appalled that misguided vigilantes have
assaulted mosques, 
Muslims, and anyone who resembles them. Still, our
trigger fingers are 
ready to fire even while the other hand guards the
safety. We want to 
find some middle ground between “an eye for an eye”
and “turn the other 
cheek.” We want the world safe again for our children.
What can we do?</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">We have already begun
to take a hard 
look at ourselves. How is it that someone thought this
was a good idea? 
People hijacked multiple planes and deliberately
sacrificed themselves 
in exchange for maximum civilian casualties. Why is it
that they hated 
us so much, or felt so unheard, or had so little to
lose, that they 
were willing to take such desperate measures?
</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">We have been way “too
busy” to pay much 
attention to the world’s people. Millions starve while
we grab a bite 
to eat or dine in quiet elegance. Refugees flee to
crowded camps while 
we crowd into concert halls and sports arenas. Cheap
labor overseas 
keeps our prices down and dividends high. And we’re
surprised that people 
hate us?</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">Officially, we have
isolated ourselves 
in dramatic ways — by walking out of the Middle East
peace process, 
challenging the nuclear test ban, refusing to sign the
Kyoto Accord, 
dropping out of the racism summit, withholding dues
from the United 
Nations even though we expect its support. Perhaps we
should not be 
so quick to walk away from international issues. Only
when we stay in 
the struggle can we find win-win solutions to
extremely complicated 
problems. </FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">We may even have to
compromise.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">An image I try to keep
in my mind is 
our beautiful planet Earth shown against the immensity
of space. No 
divisions can be seen, no nations, no races, no
wealth, no poverty. 
Last week the explosions must have been visible from
space when citizens 
from many countries lost their lives. Now citizens
from many countries 
must find a way to reach across our divisions until we
root out the 
sources of terrorism. This is too small a world for
indiscriminate hatred. 
We can no longer pretend this is someone else’s
problem.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">I believe that
God/Allah/ Yhwh calls 
us to the light of possible human cooperation and
compassion. The rest 
of the world stands ready to help us determine a wise
course of action 
as we seek a better world for all
people.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">God awaits our
decisions.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR>
