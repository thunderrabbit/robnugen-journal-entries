<p><font color='blue'>Dude:</font> you wanna see the
coolest thing on the whole internet?
<br><font color='red'>Rob:</font> I'd love that!</p>

<p>I didn't really think it would be the *cooolest*
thing on the Internet; but maybe some awesome flash
animation or some such.</p>

<p><font color='blue'>Dude:</font> add a buddy to your
buddy list named "smarterchild"</p>

<p>Wow.  Try it yourself.  Add smarterchild as a buddy
on your AOL Instant Messenger buddy list.  This is
*almost* worth getting AIM if you don't already have
it.</p>

<p>Tell him HI.</p>
