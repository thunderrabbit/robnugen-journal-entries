<p>One of my goals lately is to get back into creative
stuff.  Artistic expression.  So today I began
painting a plate at Paint This! in the Village.  It's
a plate for Wende.  I have just gotten started on the
slightest of designs.  It kinda sorta looks like a
line drawing of a mushroom with a lake underneath it. 
Once again, I have started without any concept of what
I intend to create.  Just painting a plate.</p>

<p>Jennifer gave me unlimited paint time on my little
card thing.  :-)  Nice.</p>

<p>This evening I entered some of the accounting
numbers for our investment club.  I need to write a
document that describes how to do the job of
treasurer.  A tiny part of that is written, but not a
lot yet.</p>
