HI All

I am in the station with Jessi, KTRU Social
Coordinator, and I was all, "Hey, we should all go to
a Haunted House tonight!!"

We're meeting at the station at 10pm and then
caravaning over to Phobia on 59 near Kirby.  According
to their phone message (713-526-DEAD), they are open
from 8pm until business is dead.  

$12 for 1 haunted house, $20 for 2 haunted houses (per
person).

If you've got nothing better to do tonight than be
scared outta your wits, come join us!

     - Rob!

<p>If you don't know where the station is, just meet
at Phobia.  Call the number above if you don't know
where Phobia is.  We're going to the location on
Kirby, not way out 290. Or call me at the station
713-348-5878.  (713-FIT-KTRU)</p>
