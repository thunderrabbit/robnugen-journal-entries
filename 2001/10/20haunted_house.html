subject: KTRU Social * ! TONIGHT ! *

HI All

I am in the station with Jessi, KTRU Social
Coordinator, and I was all, "Hey, we should all go to
a Haunted House tonight!!"

We're meeting at the station at 10pm and then
caravaning over to Phobia on 59 near Kirby.  According
to their phone message (713-526-DEAD), they are open
from 8pm until business is dead.  

$12 for 1 haunted house, $20 for 2 haunted houses (per
person).

If you've got nothing better to do tonight than be
scared outta your wits, come join us!

     - Rob!

at Phobia.  Call the number above if you don't know
where Phobia is.  We're going to the location on
Kirby, not way out 290. Or call me at the station
713-348-5878.  (713-FIT-KTRU)</p>
