<p>Jason from Wende's work just called for her.  It's eearly on her
day off.  She's at Maggie's though, for the night, so I gave him
Maggie's phone number.  I didn't think to have him call her cell phone
number.  So he had to wake up more people before getting to Wende.  I
wonder what is the problem at work?</p>
