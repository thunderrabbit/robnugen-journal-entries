<p>Going now to eat lunch and put a deposit on the apartment I found
yesterday.</p>

<p class=date>2:10pm</p>

<p>Wende says she's jealous of the apartment I found.  Jennifer says
Wende is just too picky when looking for her own apartment.  She has
been using the old fashioned method of driving around to look.  I just
surfed the web.</p>

<p>After checking out my apartment, we munched at Mission
Burritos.</p>

<p>Jennifer and Bob (our next door neighbors)'s friend Mario came to
look at our house twice today.  I'm glad that he likes it.</p>
