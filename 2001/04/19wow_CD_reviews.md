<p>I have just reviewed 2 CDs for KTRU (and I reviewed
1 last night).  All of them are great!</p>

<p>Climate <em>Swallow All Letters</em>
<br>v/a <em>Sonic Circuits IV</em>
<br>Elevator <em>A taste of complete
perspective</em></p>

<p>I love all 3 CDs.  So great to soon have 3 CDs
reviewed by me on playlist!  Wheeee!!!</p>
