<p>Last night Wende and I joined Chad et. al. from her work to see <a
href="http://www.otnemem.com/"><em>Memento</em></a> (the flash portion
of the site is pretty tight).  At first I
didn't like the movie; I was anticipating seeing imagery of him losing
his wife, and I really didn't want to see that.  But by the end of the
movie I was left wondering WTF?? and really am still not quite sure
what we "reality" in the movie.</p>

<p>I doubt my questions are enough to make me see it again, except
maybe on rental later.</p>

<p>I found several user sites on the movie <a
