<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Inside an old haunted house, riding on a skateboard, pulling a wagon with Wende, someone else, and John G from my extended men's group.  I was pulling them along a hallway and then it started to go downhill, and I couldn't see the bottom.  I wanted to go anyway, and pulled toward downhill then coasted coasted quickly faster and faster downhill then stopped, and held them back from sliding downhill with me.  Then a little bouncy ball rolled down the hill and I chased after it.  It reached a bottom, which was like a T intersection.  Doors to the left and to the right.  The ball bounced around in that area as I tried to catch it.  I finally caught it and then tried to climb back up the hill, but Wende and John and them were leaving me, and the doors at the top of the hill were closing.  I was scared of being left alone, then realized it was a dream.  Instead of waking up, I stayed sleeping and poured love over the entire scene, the dream went away and I was still sleeping, then I slowly woke up.</p>
