<title>work lately</title>
<p class=date>9:56pm CDT Wednesday 11 April 2001</p>

<p>Work on Monday and Tuesday was pretty focused on getting the G3
changes in place for the Singapore survey and a survey based in
California I think.  The singapore survey needed to have all traces of
javascript removed from it.  That was more of a pain than I had
predicted, but I got it done in a day or so.</p>

<p>After Spanish class last night I went back in to work to get the
Singapore survey in place online before they really started their
business day on Wednesday.  (They are 12 hours ahead of us I think)</p>

<p>Today I got the California survey data imported and moved online.
They have made a request that the current survey can't handle, but the
Ritz survey can.  So I'm going to convert the functionality of the
Ritz survey into the G3 functionality (and call it the OG survey) and
then incorporate the survey part of it into the G3.  Then the G3
survey can be super incredibly fly.</p>

<p>Once the macro programs for G3 were in place, it took me about 2
hours to set up the data for each survey and have them go live.  So
instead of a 2 week setup time, it's 2 hours.  That is totally fucking
awesome!!</p>
