<p>Last week or so I got an email from Targus
soliciting stories about how user's have enjoyed their
collapsable keyboards.  I sent them a copy from my
journal of how my keyboard got run over by a roller
coaster, but still worked for the remainder of our
trip.</p>

<p>In reverse order below is a surprising email
exchange between me and a woman named Rachel who
apparently works for the company looking for the
stories:</p>

HI Rachel!

Wow!

Wow!  Thank you so so very much!!

The truth is I already bought a new Targus keyboard to
replace the one with a broken hinge and latch.

So that I can write a journal entry on a moment's
notice, I keep the keyboard in my shorts pocket all
the time; the broken latch made the keyboard too bulky
and I just bought a new one to replace it.

I greatly appreciate the offer!

It's hard for me to turn down a free keyboard, but it
seems like the right thing to do in this case.

I'd love to hear back about the
story-acceptance-status; call me if you have any
questions!
