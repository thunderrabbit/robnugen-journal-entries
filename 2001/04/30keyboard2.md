<p>I actually just called Rachel; I was so excited
about the offer, etc.  She wondered if I knew anyone I
could give the keyboard to...  so I guess I'll accept
the free one!  I currently do *not* know if I know
anyone who would like the keyboard, but I may offer it
to Steve from Ultimate who I've voted
most-likely-to-buy-a-keyboard-after-seeing-mine.</p>

<p>Or I'll give it to someone in YRUU.  Who knows. 
Let me know if you desperately need it!</p>
