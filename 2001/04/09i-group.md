<p>I-group was absolutely magical tonight.  We all
went to my friend Kathy Fey's (massage therapist) and
she taught us some basics of massage.  Everyone was in
a silly nervous state as we arrived, but on the way
out, the energy had been transformed into a magical,
blessed, loving radiance.  So fabulous.</p>
