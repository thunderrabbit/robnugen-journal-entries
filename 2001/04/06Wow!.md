<p>I was talking to Karla about my desire to travel but feeling constrained
partially be Wende, partially by my great job here.  She apparently kept
thinking about it on her way home and wrote this message.  My reply is
below.</p>

Subject: Make the box bigger


Just rambling here and continuing the conversation.....

Sometimes you don't have to think outside the box - you just have to make it
bigger so that it holds everything you want.  Instead of thinking that there
is inherent conflict in what Wende wants and what you want - can we define a
way for both of you to get what you want?  As far as the support you can get
from us - from work - let's use the trip to Australia as a paradigm and go
from there.  We are beginning to see you step into bigger and more
responsible roles.  We LOVE you and having you on the team.  Do we love sad,
restricted Rob, or Tigger Rob?  Well - it has to be Tigger Rob, doesn't it?
But, interestingly enough, Tigger Rob is showing lots and lots of strength
and responsibility as well as enthusiasm.  So - we have to look for
opportunities that will nourish the Tigger in Rob as well as challenge him
to get even stronger.  It seems that we can look for ways to make traveling
to odd and unusual places a reality.  We may not be able to do it for months
or even weeks at a time - but - for instance - if we look at the future of
the Singapore project - with you as our primary interface - we can look for
ways to shape it so that it becomes a trip to Singapore - with a stop in
Nuie?  The primary benefit from working in a small company and being a key
player is that you can shape things - so we have to look at ways to shape
things so that you keep the security and the adventure all at once.  Let's
stay open to possibilities.
