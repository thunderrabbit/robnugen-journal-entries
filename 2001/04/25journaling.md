<p>I'm still at work; I've been reading Laura's and
Hillary's jouranl entries for the past 2 (two) two
hours.  Wow.  I enjoy their styles of writing.  Laura
uses periods to pause her thoughts.  like. this. and
she doesn't see how awesome she is! Hillary has been
writing totally fun /slash/ cute poems for all her
friends and reading Laura's journal.</p>

<p>Such voyeurs aren't we all?</p>

<p>This weekend in Los Angeles was totally wow.  I
will write about it in a second.  Actually I'll write
about it now.</p>

<p>I didn't have to write as much as I thought; I had
already typed a significant amount in my Handspring
Visor. I have just added these entries to this
month:</p>
