<p class=date>10:58 am July 2001</p>

<p>I slept for about 1.25 hours, down at the end of
the road.</p>

<p>Ellen seems to have recovered nicely; she just
mentioned that she is going to win the next game of
silent football that she plays.</p>

<p>Closing circle/worship was hot as the sun, but
nice.  We wrote/read blessings from the week.</p>

<p>Hugs to peeps as they are leaving at random moments
like photons leaving an excited atom.</p>

<p>Heidi just told me that she has been inspired by me
to be a youth advisor.  What an incredible
blessing.</p>

<p>(note: a few of you have said that, and it's an
incredible blessing each tiime.  I'm grateful to be
here for you.)</p>

<p>Bryn walked up to me. She was crying.</p>

<p>"Rob, may I have a hug?"</p>

<p>"Of course, my angel," and I put down = dropped the
stuff in my hands and hugged her so tightly for
minutes as she cried.</p>

<p>"I've just been losing so many friends this month,"
referring to her Aussie mates and YRUU homies.</p>

<p>I feel blessed by her emotions.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Hugs and tears from Elizabeth, who believes this is
her last YRUU experience.</p>

<p>I told her to write me; I will write back.  (I'll
write back to any of you who write me.)</p>

<p class=date>11:23 am</p>

<p>Chilled until about 12:30 while we determined where
to meet Sean & Joey's dad, and where to find Danny's
mom.</p>

<p>Sleep time for me.</p>
