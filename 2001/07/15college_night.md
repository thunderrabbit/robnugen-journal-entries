<p>After watching Futurama (fun episode satirizing (sp) Exxon Valdez
spill, where Bender turns into a penguin) Wende and I went to College
Night at The Container Store to help Elise' get a bunch of goodies for
her dorm room at A&M.</p>

<p>Quite a huge big deal is the College Night - the place was
<em>packed</em>, and everyone was getting hundreds of dollars worth of
stuff.  No one was fighting over particular items, but when a new pile
of under-bed drawers was presented from the back, they were snatched
up like breadcrumbs at the beach.</p>

<p>I got some small fuzzy stickers shaped like kittens.</p>
