<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I did it.  I have written code that will create a new survey in under 1
minute.  In fact, once all the parameters are given, which takes about 30
seconds, the survey is created in about 1 second.</p>

<p>Now, to be perfectly clear, this is so far only running on my machine; I
haven't moved it online yet.  I'll do that tomorrow, presuming all other
testing works out on my box.</p>

<p>Such an incredibly fucking awesome success to have this done!!</p>
