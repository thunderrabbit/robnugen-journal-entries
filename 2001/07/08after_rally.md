<p>I was sleeping until about an hour ago..  Started at 5:30am when
the Silent Fotball game fell to pieces, plus we needed to give the
drivers time to sleep.  I moved my self and stuff to sleep elsewhere
when cleanup started.</p>

<p>At closing circle we did the Beaver Song, and right into the Walrus
Song, with no mention of Kris Scott. It's been built into the cultural
memory.  Great job, Kris!!!</p>

<p>I did aristasha with Ryan as my arms until after the Elbows
Together and I was like <em>that's not going to work</em> and we were
just both in the middle of the circle until Bums Out and I bumped his
bum and he jumped out of the center and into the circle.  That was not
my intention; I just was giving a happy bum bump.</p>

<p>Mugbooks are great; they only took 2 hours to make according to
Laura M.  She said she felt the rally was a lot of fun, which is great
to hear from a rally organizer for whom the experience is often
stressful.  Super duper thanks to everyone who helped make NO01 a
great rally!!!</p>

<p>We drove to The Trolley to eat. No french quarter this year.</p>

<p>Ryan flirted with the Shell station girl with silver glitter
lipstick to let us park in the gas station parking lot instead of
finding the parking for the trolley.</p>

<p>Lauuryn to Pat, while Pat is wearing the bunny ears: "you look like
a donkeyrabbit."</p>

<p>Pat: sad face.</p>

<p>"No, because of your mohawk, and donkeys kinda have mohawks, you
look like a donkeyrabbit."</p>

<p>That's funny.</p>
