<p>Tina suggested I get some grass or chives for
'flowers' for Amy.  I found some celery in the kitchen
and got her a piece.  AJ was all, 'watch out, he's
trying to stalk you.'</p>

<p>hahahaahhahhaha!</p>

The dance was hot hot <em>hot</em> hot sweaty and
lots of fun.  A few people commented positively on my
wacky Rob's Crazy Dance.  One person asked how I
learned to dance so <em>badly</em>.  I'm not sure if
that was a compliment or not.</td></tr>

Good thing we had inflatable microphones for karaoke type entertainment!</td></tr>

hung from the rafters.  Especially impressive when they danced to
Comanche up there.</td></tr></table></p>

<p>Thanks to Amy for buying me as her date to the
dance.  :-)</p>

<p>Super sweaty, ate ice cream in the kitchen, then
took a shower, singing random songs.  Mostly sticking
to songs that we knew most of the words to.</p>

<p>While cleaning up after the dance, I found Amy L's
camera.  I just now took a picture of her
sleeping.</p>
