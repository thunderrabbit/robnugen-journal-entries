<p>Chillin on the now-folded-up pads that were gymnastics mats last
night until noon when the gymnasts left after their practice.</p>

<p>Lauren O is reading comic book of Hothead Paisan the Homoicidal
Lesbian Terrorist.  Quite a good sociopolitical commentary.</p>

<p class=message>phat pat = soooo silly.

<br>LAUURYN kicks.  yup.  so, i am an angel bunny fairy.  no one else
is wearing their Halloween costume, except me.  this is also the
smallest rally ever, *and* the first time i have met Naythign's dad,
which is really weird.  we are rdg Carol's evil crazy lesbian book and
i am feelin typically weak.  rock on, Wedding Story.  the best thing
yet today was when i told Rob about KT's 80,000-yr-old Canadian
boyfriend and her being naked.  yeah.  well, that or when i washed my
feet on Matt's stomach (it's a washboard stomach).  also, we had a
*super* birthday party for Joan--only two months early--and it was
magical because i had made her a necklace without even knowing it was
going to be her fake birthday.  in other news, Matt has *perfected*
the Nathan walk.  like, he is a *pro* now.  so that's useful.  oh oh
oh oh oh!  and this is the first rally i have ever been to where
veggies outweigh meateaters.  rock on, us.  yay.  [this has been a
message from Lauuryn who is super great, with moral support from Dane,
who is even super-er.]</p>

<p>Will and I are watching several peeps play Risk.  Wierd-ish game,
but I guess I can see how it's cool.</p>

<p>I have tried really hard to help Will feel comfortable with hanging
out with other people.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if he'll ever come back.</p>
