<p>Such a blessing to have been allowed to sleep
through the spirit circle.  I assume Adam was the one
who came through our cabin to wake us up.  He didn't
wake me up today, allowing me to sleep.  Nice.</p>

<p>I'm super thrilled with the batteries in this
thing.  They are only 1/2 drained.  I have another set
in case they don't make it the entire week.</p>

<p>Incredibly rousing shower choir!!</p>

<p><font size=+2>The Ants Go Marching One By One
<br>Hurrah!  Hurrah!
<br>The Ants Go Marching One By One
<br>Hurrah!!! (Hurrah!) Hurrah!!
<br>The Ants Go Marching One By One
<br>The Little One Stops to Suck His Thumb
<br>And They All Go Marching Down
<br>To The Ground
<br>To Get Out Of The Rain boom boom boom</font></p>

<p>I was outside the showers waiting for one to become
free as our voices blared happy song.  So great!</p>

<p class=date>4:26 pm</p>

<p>today:

<p>hackey-sack with South African rules:  no cursing,
no kicking sand, no apologies, no letting the ball go
through your legs, no letting it touch below your
shoulder.  Otherwise, you have to run around the
circle, acting like a chicken.</p>

<p>Lunch of salad and then I joined TJ Checkley, Aaron
Ryan, Nathan Sexton, Will Warner, Matt Kime in a hot
game of ultimate.  We played about 2 points and then
quit cause it's so damn hot.</p>

<p>Then I went swimming and David Johnston on me as a
base for chicken fights, beat two other teams, I
think, or 1 team twice.</p>

<p>Phat Pat with Deanna on his shoulders beat two
teams because someone grabbed the legs of the base of
the other team.</p>

<p>Then a diving contest, which was quite
entertaining.  I think Daniel Segal won.</p>

<p>But, saddest of all, we lost Darth Maul - he got
away from the swimming area and floated too far away
to reach before people noticed.  That sneaky scared
little Darth Maul.</p>

<p class=date>7:11 pm</p>

<p>Got to talk with Lawren; learned a lot about her
home and stuff.</p>
