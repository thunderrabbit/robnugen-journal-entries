<p>Roving was fun; I think we found 2 people kissing,
but I wasn't 100% sure.  They quit when I nudged them
with my foot.</p>

<p>Right now Noah, Scottie, Allie, Joey, Jasper, Hilly
are munching 3D barbecue doritos, and Jasper got 10 in
his mouth and Noah got 12, and Scottie got 4.  Now
I'll try.</p>

<p>I got 11, but then I started to gag as one was
going down my throat unchewed.  I chomped and forced
it down; it broke on the way down.</p>

<p>What amazing lead-by-example skills...</p>

<p>We just roved throuogh the camp again, and have
woken up the next rovers.  I'm going to bed bed
bed.</p>
