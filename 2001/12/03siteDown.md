<p>Somehow I let the registration of robnugen.com lapse.  I guarantee
that if I had received a reminder, I wouldn't have.  I'm curious to
know if I did get a reminder and paid it but wasn't credited or didn't
get a reminder or what.</p>

<p>But it's all good.  Proof is that you are reading this entry now.</p>

<p>I bought my domain for 10 years this time.  $15 per year is a bargain!</p>
