Your most recent issue includes the term "commodity computing power," which
reminds me of a (true) story.

I was walking across University of Houston campus and found a small
calculator floating in the water fountain.  It weighs less than one ounce,
and after all the water dried out of the calculator, it works well.  It
supports operations + - / * % and square root.

I realized an amazing thing.  In not so many years, I will find computers
floating in the UH fountain with as much computing power as an expensive
computer today.

According to <a href="https://www.datamath.org/Story/Datamath.htm#The
Cal-Tech
Project">"https://www.datamath.org/Story/Datamath.htm#The Cal-Tech
Project"</a> one of the first calculators weighed 55 pounds and cost $2500
in
1965.  (they didn't do square root, though)

According to <a
href="https://eh.net/ehresources/howmuch/dollar_question.php">https://eh.net/e
hresources/howmuch/dollar_question.php</a> $2500 in
1965 had the same purchasing power as $14000 today.

SO in the equivalent of 35 technology-years (Moore's law, etc) I will find
floating in a water fountain the processing power of a computer that costs
$14,000 today.

Wowza!

        Thanks for your continued research!
