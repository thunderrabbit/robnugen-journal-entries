<p>Last night Wende and I saw <em>Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius</em>.
Quite imaginitive and entertaining, if not particularly unrealistic
(or maybe super-futuristic!)</p>

<p>Lots of funny lines and chortles for adults (not Adult Humor), and
some good burps to boot.</p>

<p>Not quite as good as <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> though.</p>
