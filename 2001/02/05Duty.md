<p class=date>12:08pm Monday 5 February 2001</p>

<p>At work today I got the pager.  Now if there are
any problems with the webserver, I will be paged
within 15 minutes.  This reminds me of being on Duty
at Telecheck, but there won't be people at the office
24/7 watching things.  Just the computers monitoring
themselves.</p>

<p>I will turn in the pager next Monday before Wende
and I leave for Australia!</p>

<p>Oh, and this pager can send email too.  That's
pretty cool and is just a glimpse of wireless
technology creeping into my life.</p>
