</pre>

<p>On the 747 watching huge blast from the engien.  From this seat I
can see the back of the outer left engine and the water on the ground
being blown hard backward.</p>

<p>We are taxiing around the airport.  I have Wende's watch so I can
fill in the time needed to accelerate to takeoff.  I wonder what
airspeed that is.</p>

<p>They have given us headphones and socks and eyemask and pillow and
blanket.</p>

<p>Chillin beside sign [[Q1] <- Q -> ] at 1:43am CST.  We're 30
minutes late taking off.</p>

<p class=date>11:46 pm PST</p>

<p>Moving now from Q1 sign.</p>

<p class=date>11:48 pm PST</p>

<p>We are stopped again.</p>

<p class=date>11:51 pm</p>

<p>Still stopped.</p>

<p>Wow suddenly I'm crazy tired.</p>

<p class=date>11:52 pm</p>

<p>Engines winding up we are moving.  Taxiing [T 25R-7L]</p>

<p>We are en queue for takeoff but still need to turn around.</p>

<p class=date>11:54 pm</p>

<p>huge aleron on wing.  Extended way back.  Barely taxiing about to
turn around I think.  Since we got on 25 R-7L runway 2 planes have
taken off before us.  One just now (737) and one 747 and another 737.
Three total.</p>

<p class=date>11:58 pm</p>

<p>I just heard a tone and the captain said gently, "sit down!"  A 747
is rolling beside us and bang they go.  We are rumbling behind and
beside them and now turning around on U7L.  I can see 4 planes in
queue behind us.</p>

<p>We are 90 degrees, 135, 170, 180 degrees turned.</p>

<p>12:00am local time 7pm in Melbourne.</p>

<p>We are just about to <b>GO!</b></p>

<p>I have Wende's second hand on her watch.</p>
