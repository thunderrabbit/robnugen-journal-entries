<title>Investment Club</title>
<p class=date>11:39pm CST Tuesday 27 February 2001</p>

<p>I have started 3 days earlier than usual at getting stuff ready for
investment club meeting on Thursday!  I ordered software to help with
our end-of-year taxes, and had them overnighted to me so I can install
them and use them tomorrow so I can hand out K-1 forms to everyone in
the club on Thursday.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
