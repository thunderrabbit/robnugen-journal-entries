<p>Yay Veronica for picking us up at the airport!  She said Dude owes
her bigtime now.  :-)</p>

<p>At the airport Wende was all "I just want to be at home and
*sleep*."  But now she's on the phone.</p>

<p>I'm going to sleep soonishly maybe; and I'll upload a pile of
entries from my Handspring Visor tomorrow at work.</p>
