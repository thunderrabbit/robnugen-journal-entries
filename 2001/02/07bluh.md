<p>bluh gack blech grrr gigiggjdfkll;askfdljkdfjkl</p>

<p>I've been eating crappily all day - animal crackers
and Dr Pepper and a granola bar and some crackers, and
my brain isn't working for this SAS silliness.  sigh. 
bluh.</p>

<p>I wonder if in 10 years there will be available a
pill or tablet or a wafer or a snack bar that is
exactly the correct balance of nutrients a body needs.
 Just eat these nutrient bars and water all day and
have perfectly balanced nutrients flowing through the
body.</p>
