<p>Just now while in the shower, I was reliving our
conversation.  Bryn expressed how completely she
wished  I could know how much I helped her, and I
cried happy tears, as named by Wende's and my marriage
counselor a couple weeks ago.</p>

<p>Bryn, know how much I live and love to give this
type of support.</p>

<p>Know how much you help me see my life path.</p>
