<p>6am began wakeup and breakfast noises, and two
women arrived to apply make-up to all the bride's
maids.  I got up, not for make-up, but to get caught
up on all my email!  Yay!!</p>

<p>Bryn slept until 8am or so and emerged squinty eyed
and wobbly from her room.</p>

<p>I'm about to take a shower and then we'll be
leaving in a couple of hours for the church!  It's a
big church too.</p>

<p>Here is apparently the official site: <a

<p>But this user site has better pictures: <a
