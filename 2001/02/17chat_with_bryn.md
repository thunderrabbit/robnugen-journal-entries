<p class="message">Hello Rob.  We are at Irene and Nick's wedding
reception.  i can't remember the last one of these i attended but it
must have beAn quite some time ago.  it is super dark in here.
anyways, i love nick's smile (as i have expressed and wish for you to
remeber) and irene is so beautiful and their happiness in an odd way
definitely inspires me.  who knows when these same rituals will be
performed in my honor, but i await them excitedly.  anyways, i hope
you are having as good a time as everyone else and especially me.
smiles.  brynsies</p>

<p>what about a greek wedding?</p>

<p class="message">a greek wedding is an amazing way to see a different
culture in action.  i feel privileged to have gotten to experience
this, especially with you and wende.  When else would i have ever had
a chance like this?  this is OZsome.</p>

<p>We definitely are blessed to experience such a cultural event.
Hanging out with you in OZ has beAn beyond incredible!!</p>

<p class="message">Truue!  It is hard to believe it is real but i think
before anything when i think 'Melbourne with R& W' i will think of
sitting at the park outside Luna Park and looking at the birds and
playing with the devil sticks and walking and being happy.  that was
so nice and good and memorable.  i can't describe my plethora of
emotions but i know that part of me is definitely noticing the changes
in 'me' since i have beAn in oz because of my interactions with
someone from back home.  i compare my old self with rob and then think
about 'newer me' interacting with the same rob and i am amazed at how
i have changed, for better or for worse.  you are helping me to see
those changes.  i definitely thank you for that.</p>

<p class="message">Heaps better.  You are growing indescribably mature
and I'm so proud of you and honored to be part of your life.  I
believe that by traveling the world, you are experiencing SO MANY
different cultures and things that you really get to define who *you*
are amidst all the everything.  We met a barefoot man who had thin
flipflops and apparently makes a living making and performing with and
selling devil sticks.  You now have the choice of doing that for part
of your life.</p>

<p>You are experiencing a Greek wedding.  Now this gives you a sense
of what it might be like to marry a greek god of a man (at least the
weding part but)</p>

<p>You are meeting millions of peep from different countries and you
are welcome to visit many of them whenever you visit their country.
You see their culture and traditions and language and can incorporate
those into your life.</p>

<p class="message">truue, but my cynicism for life (and horror movies)
has become a very big pessimistic part of my life
which i attribute to my leaving home just a bit too
soon.  c'est la vie.  i will learn.</p>
