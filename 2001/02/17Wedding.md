<p>Wedding was long and lovely; Bryn and I sat
together and I took lots of pictures.</p>

<p>Now Bryn and I are gettng fish and chips before we
go play at Luna Park!</p>

<p>I exceptionally appreciate having Bryn as a tour
guide.</p>

<p>The Bridal Party has embarked on 4 or 5 hours
(<em>hours</em>, wearing their dresses and suits) of
having pictures taken around the city.</p>
