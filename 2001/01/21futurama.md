<p>For the first time in quite a while, I got to see a new episode of
Futurama!!  Yay!!!  It's been interrupted for the past several weeks
by stupid football games.  I have heard that the superbowl is next
week, and I assume that will be the last week the Futurama is
preempted for football.</p>

<p>The episode was great - Fry got worms and his friends shrunk
themselves and jumped inside his body (like Innerspace) but the worms
actually made him better so Lela tried to foil their efforts.  Great
episode.  I love Futurama!</p>
