<p>Awesome: <a

<p>I have just spent several minutes reading and watching this site.</p>

<p>I got to work all early today so I can leave early so Wende and I can go
to our Spanish class tonight.  I still haven't gotten any work done yet,
though.  Doh!  I've been reading my personal email and reading <a
href="http://www5.compaq.com/rcfoc/">RCFoC</a> (where I got the Magic 8 Ball
link).  Okay, now I'm going to work work work on the latest incarnation of
the Ritz Project.</p>
