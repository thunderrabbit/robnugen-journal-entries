<p>Wende is home and I told her the story.  Amazing how I am
practically unable to simply gently reminisce about the rally; I just
think about Elizabeth and Christina.</p>

<p>I'm in a weird state of being tired and not tired.  I'm surprised
that it's 11pm; it doesn't seem that late.  It feels like 9pm to me
now.  Interesting after I was so close around 5pm.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
