HI

I have just moved online the New Improved Ritz Project.

Using eight sas macros, this model is able to host multiple organizational
health surveys, each with:

*) any number of pages
*) any number of languages
*) optional questions (asked only if user gives certain answers to a
different question)
*) optional pages (displayed only if user gives certain answers to a
different question)
*) a response rate site for the administrator of the survey

Each "set" of surveys ("set" = all surveys administered by a specific
administrator) has 3 datasets that define the characteristics of the set:  1
for password(s) for the admin(s), 1 for the text the admins see, 1 for
specifics of each survey in the set.

Each survey in a set requires 2 datasets:  1 for questions, and 1 for
responses.

	Yay!
	- Rob
