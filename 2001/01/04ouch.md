<p>OW!!  Fuck!</p>

<p>I just hit my head on a computer.  My forehead has a big welt on it and
some blood.  People here are all "oh god" when they see it.</p>

<p>I was basically on my knees reaching underneath a desk to hook up a
computer cable and hit my head on the corner of the computer.  I reeled back
in pain and lay on the floor.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Wende happened to be there and got me ice in a napkin.</p>

<p>We still had lunch for Dennis' 40th birthday today.  My head is pretty
much better now, just sore and really sensitive to touch</p>
