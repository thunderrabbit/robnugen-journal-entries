I'm sick and don't want to come sneeze or cough on
the air, or on the mic.
 
I *can* come in and will if no one can take the
shift.
 
Tonight 7-9pm Saturday 27 January 2001
 
    Thanks!

<p>I just called Ben at the radio station; he said he
will cover for me tonight.  I am SO thankful.  I will
write him a letter from down under.</p>

<p>My headache is just so icky that I don't want to
move or talk.  I'm going back to bed.</p>
