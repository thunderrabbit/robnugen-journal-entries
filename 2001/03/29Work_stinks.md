<title>Work stinks</title>
<p class=date>6:32pm CST Thursday 29 March 2001</p>

<p>You know - By my normal rating, I've had a pretty productive day
at work, but as I was leaving, I got this overwhelming feeling of "oh
my god that fucking sucked to have been cooped up all day!"  This
sucks shit!</p>

<p>I said "hola" and "que paso" to the spanish speaking guy on the
other side of the fence from our parking lot, but I couldn't really
think of anything smart to say past that so I didn't.  As soon as I
got in my car, all these appropriate spanish phrases came to mind.
Dammit.  Next time I see him, I'll yack in spanish with him.</p>

<p>I'm chillin' for a bit before I go to Dude's house to help him set
up his linux box today.</p>
