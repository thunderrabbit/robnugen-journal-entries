<p class=date>5:23pm Monday 12 March 2001</p>

<p>I came home from work early today (around 1pm)
because Wende came home sick from her work.  I decided
it would be more pleasant to sleep in a suitably
snuggly fashion than to be at work.</p>

<p>I will work from/at home tonight.</p>

<p>I'm leaving for I-group now.</p>
