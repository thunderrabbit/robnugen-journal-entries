<p>Ton of traffic on the way here; it took us about 45 minutes to get to the

Garden to munch.</p>

<p class=message>This is very annoying, did you not know?</p>

<p>My injuries are slight:  "rug burns" on my knees (from my slide wearing
sweatpants, sore nose after getting bonked in the nose, small cut on my left
thumb, and a dime sized blood blister on my left foot.</p>

<p>We are just now seated and ordering at Olive Garden.</p>

<p>During the wait, I talked a lot to James. He said that historians find
journals quite valuable, especially if they chronicle a historiaclly
significant event.</p>

<p>Sean wants to make sure I note that he got 51 points today.</p>

back seat. Super thanks to Mike for driving!!</p>

<p>Great day today.  Everyone played a great game.  And even with 21 people
on the team, most everyone got a point.  So great.</p>

<p>Mike just pulled a U turn almost in front of a cop. </p>
