Happy birthday, jughead.  That is, happy 11,323rd day
anniversary.
Some time ago you asked what the status of my major is
so you'd know
what to tell people.  For future reference, if you
forget, just say
any damn thing, and it probably won't be too far from
the truth.
However, for the record, here's the story:

Highlights              Details
-----------             --------
UH: 92-96, BS math      U of Houston; less fun overall
than HS; made
                        many friends who remain close.

UNT: 96-99, MS math     U of North TX in Denton, TX;
actually spent 
                        Fall of 1997 at NM State U in
Las Cruces,
                        but left because I hated the
administration
                        (even more than I hated UH's
administration); 
                        had more fun at UNT than
anywhere else to date.

Georgia Tech:           GA Institute of Technology;
did math
Summer 99               consulting for an ME guy;
Georgia Tech has the
                        prettiest campus I've ever
been to.  

Stanford: 99-01,        The Bay Area is expensive as
fuck, but I love
MS mech. eng.           this area more than anywhere
else I've ever
                        lived except Boston -- I refer
to Palo Alto as
                        The Promised Land; Stanford is
the only school
                        that has challenged me, and it
put me in my
                        place; made a couple of
friends who will
                        remain close; financial aid
came entirely from
                        student loans and credit
cards.

?????: 01-05?,          U of Chicago                 ?
 
PhD math                Berkeley

                        Carnegie Mellon University

                        Stanford                     ?
                        Ohio State University       
accepted
                        UT-Austin                    ?

I'm going to go visit Ohio State next week; I'll say
hi to Pete for
you.
