<p>Awww yeah.</p>

<p>At work, we are now on T1, baby.</p>

<p>Getting it installed and functioning was more
difficult than it should have been.  Anti-thanks to
the guy who said he couldn't help more because the
router is pro-connect (we have password) and not
pro-managed (they have password).</p>

<p>Super duper thanks to David who took the time to
figure out what was the situation on our end and asked
a smart tech guy how to solve it.</p>

<p>Super duper incredible thanks to John who fixed it,
and then tracked down another problem after the first
fix didn't actually fix it.  So awesome!  I will write
a happy letter to his boss!</p>

<p>I'm writing this entry now from work over our new
T1 connection.  Whoo hoo!!!</p>
