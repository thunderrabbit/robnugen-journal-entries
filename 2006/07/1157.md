[Writely](http://writely.com), the online word/blog processor, allows one to read/write/upload/save/collaborate text documents online, including, apparently, posting to one's blog, which I am testing now.Props to writely crew for doing such a good job that Google has recently scooped them up in its plan to replace local storage with infinite storage online.Registration to writely is closed, except via invitation.  Special props to Piet for inviting me!
