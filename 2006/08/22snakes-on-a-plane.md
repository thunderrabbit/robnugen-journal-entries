[Snakes on a Plane](http://www.snakesonaplane.com)





is pretty much a ridiculous movie, but I guess it could give a few shocky moments to those afraid to fly or those afraid hang out with snakes, or those simply afraid to do both at the same time.





There's a few funny lines, well one... but it wasn't memorable enough for me to remember it.Â  I do remember a great slew of things that simply could not have happened.





Snakes would not be all chipper while basically freezing their tails off in cargo hold, and Myth Busters proved that a gunshot in a pressurized plane won't do what it does in the movies, and the swooping recovery from watery death seemed a bit... hollywood.





I say don't see it on the big screen, but it's worth a laugh at a slumber party.
