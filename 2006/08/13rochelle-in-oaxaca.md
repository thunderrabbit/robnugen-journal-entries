Hello all…  

  

So things in Oaxaca are intensifying and fast.  

  

Last week there was a 2000+ womens' march of the Popular Assembly of the  

State of Oaxaca (APPO).  A quick recap, this is the organization that  

formed after the June 14th police repression of the striking teachers  

union SNTE Section 22.  APPO is made up of the teachers as well as a huge  

variety of social organizations who support the teachers.  Since APPO's  

formation the main goal has been to force the resignation of the  

right-wing corrupt governor of Oaxaca State, Ulises Ruiz Ortiz.  The main  

method being used to acheive this is to use nonviolent tactics to stop the  

state government from functioning.  The state Government House, the State  

Congress and the Oaxaca Superior Tribunal of Justice, the Department of  

Finances, the General Attorney’s office, the penal tribunals, and other  

facilities have all been blockaded.  

  

So back to the women, after marching for five miles they nonviolently took  

over the state tv station and have controlled it ever since.  It took them  

a few hours to get it up and running but since then they have been playing  

the footage of the June 14th repression, the march of 400,000 teachers and  

growing number of supporters 2 weeks later, and other indymedia style  

documentaries of class struggles going on throughout Mexico.  They even  

played a documentay on the oppression faced by the Palestinians.  The  

media here is controlled by the wealthy and those in power, like in the  

states, so these things had never made it on to television.  The televison  

station also has two affilited radio stations which the women now control  

as well.  

  

The movement has truly been growing, the largest mass movement I have ever  

witnessed.  It is spreading throughout the whole state of Oaxaca. 40  

municipalities and towns around the state have made changes to those in  

power, 20 municipal town halls are currently occupied. Nineteen  

municipalities have joined APPO and have sent people here to Oaxaca city  

to further the struggle.  APPO has set up road blockades through out the  

state and have taken over 6o public buses and 18 government cars.  

  

Last week it was clear that APPO was acheiving its goals.  The movement  

was growing and its voice was loud and clear through the women on the  

television and radio stations and the university radio station.  Then on  

the night of  August 6th, although denied by President Vicente Fox, 300  

officers of the Federal Preventive Police arrived in the city.  On the  

8th, 30 police men dressed in civilian clothing tried to disperse one of  

the blockades in front of an occupied public building with tear gas and  

gunfire.  One woman was shot in the leg.  Then the repression began to  

show up all over the city in a series of events which I will list below to  

keep it short...  

  

August 7th  

Two men start a bus on fire outside the university radio station as a  

distraction, they then proceed to throw acid on the transmitter.  Radio  

Universidad is shutdown.  

A NGO leader is disappeared.  

A university professor is shot dead in his car.  

  

August 8th  

A leading indigenous rights advocate and active in APPO, who is wheelchair  

bound from past police torture, is picked up by masked men in an unmarked  

car and disappeared with two men who were with him.  

Two men enter the state newspaper, Noticias, which has been sympathetic to  

the struggle and shoot into the air.  

  

August 10th  

The government of Oaxaca announced arrest warrants for 50 leaders of APPO,  

including many NGO leaders and leaders within the teachers union Section  

22. According to the Secretary of Public Security, this is to “guarantee  

the safety” of the state.  

  

Also yesterday, a march was called by APPO against this repression and for  

the release of those who have been disappeared.  At least 20,000 people  

marched through the streets.  From the sidelines of the march shots were  

fired killing one man, the husband of a teacher. The house that the shots  

came from was rented by the police and a federal police badge was found  

inside. Today APPO held a huge procession for the man who was killed  

during the march into the center square, thousands attended the funeral  

and chants that the struggle will continue were repeated for hours.  

  

I believe the movement in Oaxaca has become a strong and diverse class  

struggle against the corrupted officials and business-people who have been  

in power in Oaxaca for decades. The state of Oaxaca is 70 percent  

indigenous and has a long history of resistance and struggle.  Those in  

power have begun a dirty war against the movement and I fear for these  

brave people who continue to take a strong stand against extreme injustice  

and corruption even as they see their fellow compañer@s fall.

And I encourage any of you that are able to make a call or write to  

Vicente Fox and others to demand an end to this repression and respect for  

human rights in the state of Oaxaca.  Contact info to follow...  

  

with love,
