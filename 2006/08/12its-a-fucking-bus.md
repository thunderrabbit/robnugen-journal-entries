> _the civilized hijackings of the seventies are over. if guy says he has a bomb, you're all going to die anyway--bum rush him.  problem solved, just like on united 93.  no need for extra security, we can take care of things ourselves._


That is from a thread between me, Dude and my brother after the announcement that we can't bring drinks onto planes anymore:

From: American Embassy Tokyo
Date: Aug 11, 2006 10:57 AM
Subject: Public Announcement

<snip>

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is implementing a series of security measures, some visible and some not visible, to ensure the security of the traveling public and the nation's transportation system.

NO LIQUIDS OR GELS OF ANY KIND WILL BE PERMITTED IN CARRY-ON BAGGAGE. SUCH ITEMS MUST BE IN CHECKED BAGGAGE.

This includes all beverages, shampoo, suntan lotion, creams, tooth paste, hair gel, and other items of similar consistency

Exceptions: Baby formula and breast milk if a baby or small child is traveling and medicines, which must be presented for inspection at the checkpoint.

what's crazy is that they are still allowing each person to carry two books of matches!!!  I really do not get this.  You cannot smoke on planes and in most airports.  Smoking is not vital to national security, and its a horrible public health problem.  oh yeah....  the tobacco lobby gives alot of money to politicians.  Now I get it.

It's infuriating!   _(ed. note: I am a genius!)

the whole thing is a pile of shit.  chertoff is a complete idiot.  he is fourth on my list of people to hate after karl rove, dick cheney, and donald rumsfeld.  oh, and speaking of karl rove, i want to kick robert novak in the nuts for protecting him, and then patrick fitzgerald for giving rove immunity.  whatever company novak works for, i am never giving them money ever.

but back to air travel.  i mean, the system *worked*!  the bad guys got caught!  the us/uk cops could have intervened weeks ago, but they decided to wait until the shit was going down before arresting anybody, and now look at what's happened: water is the new terrorist threat.

recall that idiot who tried to light his shoes on fire.  everyone now knows the score: the civilized hijackings of the seventies are over. if guy says he has a bomb, you're all going to die anyway--bum rush him.  problem solved, just like on united 93.  no need for extra security, we can take care of things ourselves.  but what's happened? we still have to take off our shoes or get the wand, even years later! it's completely stupid, and it's a health risk.

people, people.  it's a fucking *bus*.  get on, sit down, and shut up.
there is no magic any more.  it is not a luxury cruise.  you cannot be "secure."  you fly a plane cause it's *faster*, not because it's cheaper or safer.

i am writing a letter to my congressman telling him that he'd better get it in gear or i'm not voting for him.  no incumbents.  fuck you guys.

From: Dude

amen!!!  I totally agree that any MF who tried anything on a plane would get bum-rushed and killed by passengers.  I know I'd be one of the people kicking the guy's ass.  I'd let out all of the anger I have at the bush administration on that dude.  he'd be toast.  hahaha.
