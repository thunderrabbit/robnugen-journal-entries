Good-oh-my-gosh-it's-cold-here-evening from Canada:

So the twins have safely arrived in Toronto!!!!  We had quite a
flight to say the least!!   Maria managed to get her visa for Canada
exactly 6 hours prior to take-off. Check-in became a complete debacle
when the ground staff told us that two of our boxes were .5 kilograms
over and would need to be repacked.  Luckily the pilots for our flight
were checking in at the counter beside us...and offered to carry onto
the plane...the seven packages of Pokari Sweat powder and the one book
that was causing the extra weight.  It wasn't until we were well in
the air that Maria decided to tell the pilot...he had just carried
seven packages of white powder onto an international flight for a
Colombian...we all had a good laugh about that ....later!!!

Anyway...we arrived to Canada to minus 1 weather ..and light
snow...it all looked so pretty until the doors of the airport opened
and Maria refused to leave.  To make a long story short I did manage
to get her out of the airport, into the car and at my new house.

Yesterday we went to go out for a walk and I could see Maria
struggling with her winter jacket..and then she informed me..."I'm not
sure how to manage this system (aka- the zipper)....after she took off
her three pairs of gloves..."the system" worked much better!!  But
then she informed me that it was difficult to see all her curves under
so many layers...I told Canadians have never been known for their
sex-appeal...and to add another layer!!!  She's getting better day by
day!!!

Anyway..just a quick note to say hello to everyone and that we have
arrived safely. This cold Canadian weather has been a bit of a shock
to our systems....but the Baileys and hot chocolates are working
wonders!!!

Love and hugs and peace and icicles,
Carla and Maria
