How incredibly ridiculous to imagine this is any kind of good solution.Â  It may keep the ground frozen for a bit, but certainly not for a particularly long time, and it definitely doesn't solve the second-basic issue (*) the ground is shifting!  

  

(*) right after the basic issue of global warming





Why not put the tracks on a solid surface of concrete so the ground can shift underneath and the concrete will keep the tracks straight.Â  Little sensors can tell where the ground is subsiding so they can be re-supported.





Yes, I know, I am an armchair engineering genius!
