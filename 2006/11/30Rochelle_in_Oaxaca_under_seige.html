Hello all...

Things in Oaxaca have reached an all time low.  After the megamarch last Saturday the federal and
state government forces have begun a full siege on the movement. I wrote the article below for Works
in Progress describing my experience on Saturday.

(dad... i recommend you don't read this one)

Please keep the people of Oaxaca in your hearts and minds and take action if at all possible.

love and solidarity,
rochelle

Running as fast as I can, surrounded by hundreds of others, I can hear screams behind me.  Glancing
back, through the darkness of night I can only differentiate between the masses running with me and
the federal police by the light reflecting off their shields and face masks.  They are still
advancing.  A hand pushes my left shoulder and I realize there are medics behind me trying to run
from the police while carrying a man on a stretcher clasping a bloody cloth to his head.  The medics
are trying to reach the makeshift clinic that the movement set up in a building just a few feet
ahead. I continue to run block after block as more people pour in from side streets.  The police are
obviously advancing on multiple streets simultaneously.  Panic is starting to set in. Rushing
through my mind are the stories I have listened too over an over in the past two weeks while
interviewing those who have suffered human rights violations at the hands of the federal police; the
stories of sexual assault, of beatings, of psychological torture, of death threats.  A few men duck
in to an alley, I follow unsure if I am escaping the danger or running directly into it.  A woman
and her daughter, who recognize me from the internet cafe, motion us into their home.  Inside I lean
against the wall and slide to the floor.  Immediately I think of those who were unable to find a
place to hide, of those who could not run, people of all ages had been in the streets all day.  I
hear gunshots.

7th Mega March Turned Confrontation
Saturday, November 25th, had begun with the 7th Megamarch. Thousands had marched from the outskirts
of Santa Maria Coyotepec to the Oaxaca City center. It was yet another incredible showing of support
for the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca (APPO).  The march was calling for the removal of
both the corrupt governor of Oaxaca, Ulises Ruiz Ortiz, and the Federal Preventative Police (PFP)
who have been in Oaxaca for almost a month now.  The demonstrators were a highly diverse group,
including people of all ages, from various indigenous groups, unions, social organizations and rural
villages.  People gathered along the streets applauding as the march passed.  Many handed out
tangerines, water and sandwiches to the crowd.

When they arrived in the city the plan was to encircle the center square for 48 hours. This is the
square where striking teachers from all over the state of Oaxaca created an encampment which led to
the beginning of the movement over 6 months ago. The federal police have occupied it since they
entered Oaxaca on October 29th.  As the people began the circle, the police in full riot gear,
refined their formation at each of the entrances backed by a police officer armed with live
ammunition on top of an armoured vehicle. Although APPO had made it clear that the plan was to
remain completely non-violent, within half an hour street battles broke out between the movement and
the police in at least two of the entrances.  Some members of the movement, armed with rocks,
Molotov cocktails and fireworks, faced off with the police who used an incredible amount of tear
gas, rocks and marbles shot with slingshots. Also, according to LIMEDDH, the Mexican League in
Defense of Human Rights, state government backed paramilitaries were seen on the roofs of buildings
helping to provoke the confrontations.  Earlier in the day the radio station affiliated with Ulises
political party (Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI) had called for people to dump boiling
water and acid on the demonstrators.

Federal Police Advance
After awhile the police pushed the people north up the hill, at one point taking over the Santo
Domingo plaza where the movement has been centered since the police forced them out of the main
square. The police continued to fire teargas into the crowd and burnt the tarps and other belongings
of the movement and vendors in the Santo Domingo plaza. The report from APPO's most recent
Constitutive Congress were scattered all over the ground. During this time plain clothed police were
detaining people in the streets. After the police retreated back to the main square, many movement
members regrouped in Santo Domingo as night was falling.

Suddenly the police advanced over eight blocks forcing the crowd to continue running north of the
main square. Paramilitary groups also arrived on the scene shooting into the crowd as people ran for
their lives.  Movement members attempted to set up barricades, I witnessed many women scrambling to
gather rocks for defense, breaking stones off the fancy plazas were Ulises has squandered the states
money.  Cars and government buildings were lit on fire.  Throughout the next few hours federal
police and plain clothed gunmen continued to attack members of the movement who had taken cover in
various locations. Three movement members were killed, 39 disappeared, 149 detained, and over 140
injured (20 with live ammunition), not including the hundred people the medics assisted who were
overwhelmed by the gas and pepper spray. And this is just on November 25th.

The people of Oaxaca who are facing this fate are guilty of the crime of demanding justice and
trying to organize a democratic alternative to the corrupt and repressive leadership that governs
their state. The Mexican federal government's response, supposedly to restore order, has instead
attempted to maintain the exploitive status quo through further repression and with no regard for
the true root causes of this conflict, the extreme poverty and unjust government policies that
benefit a few at the cost of the majority.  According to Yessica Sanchez of LIMMEDH, "It is clear
that the PFP are not interested in instilling peace, what they come to do is intimidate and try to
criminalize the social movement in Oaxaca."  If the federal police had come to Oaxaca with the true
intention of restoring order, those who have committed the violence in the last 6 months of the
struggle would be brought to justice.  Nowhere are movement members safe from the threat of armed
attack.  Members of the movement have been killed while handing out coffee to late night barricades,
while participating in a march, or while leaving a neighborhood APPO meeting.  Their murderers still
walk the streets, now with the added protection and assistance of the PFP.

Ulises Claims Victory
On the morning after the mass repression, standing in the very spot where hundreds had run for their
lives less than 18 hours before, Governor Ulises claimed victory.  It had been months since he had
been able to show his face in the city.  As helicopters flew overhead, Governor Ulises, surrounded
by plain clothed police, explained that now Oaxaca belongs to the true Oaxaquenos. "We who love
Oaxaca, its history and its traditions feel profoundly offended and attacked by the vandals' actions
on Saturday.  The responsible are being arrested and should be held accountable for their actions in
the face of justice. Today with the help of the PFP and the state forces we have recuperated the
heart of Oaxaca for the Oaxaquenos and for all Mexicans."  For hours prior to this press spectacle
workers had cleaned up the remains of the police repression, they has picked up the tear gas
canisters, the graffiti and stencils had been painted over.  A large water truck has sprayed away
the dried blood and burnt remains of the movement from the square.

Since November 25th the federal police have surrounded the Santo Domingo plaza and most large parks
in the city, they are routinely patrolling the streets of Oaxaca.  Reports of people being taken out
of their homes or picked up off the streets by armed gunmen are being called in to Radio Universidad
regularly.  The station has once again called for support in fear that the police will manage to
ignore the autonomous nature of the university and destroy the station, the primary means of
communication remaining for the movement.  Students of the College of Medicine at the Benito Juarez
Autonomous University organized a press conference to share their testimonies of witnessing
municipal police kill three demonstrators during Saturday's repression, taking their bodies with
them.  During the press conference armed gunmen fired into the building and took one student.  There
were 60 more detentions on November 27th.  The PRI radio station has called for the burning of EDUCA
offices, a well respected social organization that operates throughout the state.  The station has
also been reading on the air the addresses where suspected movement members and internationals are
hiding.  Over 140 of the movement members detained by the police have been transported far from
their families, out of the state of Oaxaca, to federal prison.

Those in power continue to try to suppress this movement with intimidation, with violence, with
murder because change is in motion.  According to Cesar Chavez, "once social change begins, it
cannot be reversed. You cannot uneducate the person who has learned to read. You cannot humiliate
the person who feels pride. You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore. We have seen
the future, and the future is ours." On November 10th-12th, the movement held a Constitutive
Congress where they elected 220 representatives from all seven regions, formalizing the popular
governance structure of APPO.  3000 people attended the forum further defining their program of
struggle and creating a true bottom up alternative to the corrupt political parties that run the
state.  I still fear for the people, how much suffering they will have to face.  On November 20th
there were an incredible number of actions worldwide in solidarity with the people of Oaxaca but
there needs to be an even larger outcry.  Please consider getting involved in solidarity actions.
This is not simply to support the people of Oaxaca achieve self determination and social justice.
They are providing a model for the rest of Mexico to also stand up in the face of poverty estimated
at over 50 percent of the population, of losing their land and resources to foreign corporations, of
having to flee to the US illegally to be able to provide for their families.

On the national level, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador held his own swearing in ceremony on November
20th as the "legitimate president" of Mexico in front of hundreds of thousands of supporters.  Two
days prior he told his supporters "Those neo-fascist reactionaries better not think they'll have
room to maneuver, we're going to keep them on a short leash."  Massive civil disobedience is planned
for December 1st, the date of the inauguration ceremony for Felipe Calderon, who "won" the
presidential election by less than one percentage point with clear evidence of fraud.  The trend of
electing leftist leadership continues in Latin America, confronting the injustice of neoliberal
policies and beginning to unravel the exploitive policies that have left the majority of their
population in immense poverty.  At the same time, President Bush has quietly dropped the ban on
training the militaries of Latin America.  As our country readies itself to carry on our legacy of
genocide to prevent the much needed changes the people are demanding, we must become active.  Not
only for the people of Oaxaca, or Mexico, or Latin America but for the global struggle that is
taking root.

AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL CALL TO ACTION
28 November 2006
Mexico: At least 149 people in detention

Following a violent confrontation between supporters of the Popular Assembly of the People of Oaxaca
(Asamblea Popular del Pueblo de Oaxaca, APPO) and the Federal Preventive Police (Policia Federal
Preventiva, PFP) in the centre of Oaxaca on 25 November, at least 149 people have been detained.
Amnesty International believes that they may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment while in
custody.

The violence followed a demonstration organized by APPO supporters, to protest against the presence
of PFP in the city and to call for the resignation of the Governor of Oaxaca. During the clashes
with the police, dozens of people were reportedly injured by stones and intoxicated by teargas.
There were also several reports that some people had been shot and wounded. Dozens of cars and buses
and several public buildings, including the State Superior Court (Tribunal Superior de Justicia) and
a theatre, were set on fire. According to reports, groups of armed men wearing balaclavas, believed
to be state police, shot at protesters and buildings and arrested scores of people, several of whom
reportedly had no involvement in the demonstrations.

By the end of the day, the authorities published the names of 149 people being held in two state
prisons of Tlacolula and Miahuatlan, both outside the city of Oaxaca. All detainees have reportedly
been denied access to family and independent legal counsel (suspects are generally forced to rely on
inadequate public defenders provided by the authorities). There are also reports that on 27
November, 141 detainees were transferred to a prison in the remote state of Nayarit. Families and
human rights organizations have not been informed of the charges faced by those in detention.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

An Amnesty International delegation recently visited the city of Oaxaca and interviewed scores of
victims of human rights violations committed during the ongoing crisis in Oaxaca. The organization
documented the repeated violations committed by unidentified armed groups, believed to be state and
municipal police officers working in plain clothes, who make arrests without identifying themselves
or explaining the reasons for arrests. The organization documented in several cases the use of
incommunicado detention over several days. The organization also received credible reports that
detainees had been tortured and ill-treated, primarily by state and municipal police, but also by
members of the PFP.

In May 2006 teachers initiated a strike in Oaxaca state calling for improved pay and conditions, and
occupied the main square and surrounding streets. An attempt by state police to forcibly evict
teachers on 14 June led to a radicalization of the protest and the formation on of the Asamblea
Popular del Pueblo de Oaxaca, APPO (Popular Assembly of the People of Oaxaca), an umbrella
organization of social and political groups in support of the teachers and calling for the
resignation of the state governor. As the climate of violence in the city increased, armed police in
plain clothes started to arbitrarily detain protesters and were reportedly responsible for several
shootings. Protesters established barricades in many neighborhoods in late August and the security
situation further declined as unidentified armed men continued to target opposition supporters in
marches and on barricades. On 29 October, the PFP entered the city to restore order. The operation
resulted in the death of two civilians and the detention and injury of scores of others. Many of
those who have been detained during the crisis have been released reportedly as a result of
political negotiations, but with no clear idea of whether they may face re-arrest at a future date.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
Please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible:

- calling on the authorities to ensure all those detained during protests
on 25 November are allowed immediate access to families, adequate medical
attention and legal counsel of their choice;

- calling for them to be either charged with a recognizably criminal
offence or released immediately;

- calling on the authorities to ensure the physical and mental integrity
of those in custody and to carry out immediate and impartial
investigations into allegations of torture or ill-treatment;

- reminding the authorities to their duty to maintain public order while
protecting the human rights of all people, and ensuring that the use of
force is proportionate and necessary to confront the threat faced;

- calling for an immediate and impartial investigation into the use of
armed groups, believed to be state and municipal police, operating
illegally to attack and detain protesters and passers-by, and for those
responsible to be held to account;

- urging the federal and state authorities to ensure that all measures
taken to address the crisis in Oaxaca fully respect international human
rights law, and calling for them to avoid taking action which may worsen
the human rights situation.
