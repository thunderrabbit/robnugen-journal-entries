Wow. Just watched Radio starring Cuba Gooding Jr and Ed Harris.. Super awesome movie relaying the true story of a perpetual student/coach/fixture in a high school. Set in the mid 70s, there is a certain bit of tension between black vs white and football-lovin' vs people-lovin' people. No blood, no overt violence. Really a great story and a great movie. Kudos to those who put it together, and Kudos to Radio for showing people the light.  
  
My favorites:  
  
"We got black eyed peas??"  
  
"Stay on the bench, Radio."  
"Who?"  
"You!"  
"Oh!"  
  
"Is *that* what you wanted, Frank??"  
  
The cop helping Radio pass out presents...
