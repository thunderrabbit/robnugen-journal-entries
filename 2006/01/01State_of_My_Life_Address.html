<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="I">
<li><p>I intend to make this SoML quite thorough.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm a GET Teacher on P3ace B0at's 52nd Voyage.</p>

<p>Last night was our sixth night onboard, and we have already gotten
through a bit of a group concern (P and P), plus Petra and I have had
an issue and worked through it (in a much less public way).</p></li>

<li><p>Last night was the first time I have celebrated New Year's on
a cruise ship, or any other public transport.</p></li>

<li><p>Last night was the first time I have celebrated New Year's more
than probably 30 miles from my self/partner-funded home, not counting
the fact that last night was the first time I've celebrated New Year's
while not having a permanent residence.</p></li>

<li><p>I spell P3ace B0at this way or as the simpler PB because my
journal from the previous voyage contained some stuff that PB people
thought could be used against them by people who don't like the
organization.</p></li>

<li><p>So far on this voyage, I have 
  <ol type="i">
  <li><p>successfully gone to bed every night at a decent hour</p></li>
  <li><p>gotten up every morning with a decent amount of sleep,
  usually waking up naturally (without an alarm)</p></li>
  <li><p>felt quite helpful as a repeating teacher</p></li>
  <li><p>really enjoyed Dan and Carl as my roommates</p></li>
  <li><p>introduced Francois to basically all the GET students (en
  masse) while on stage</p></li>

  <li><p>played three games of Pente one night with Rie</p></li>
  <li><p>found a Mandarin-exchange teacher (first lesson in 7 minutes)</p></li>
  <li><p>been working to remember people's names</p></li>
  <li><p>not played silent football</p></li>
  <li><p>Nearly finished <em>Speaker for the Dead</em></p></li>
  <p class="date">1:36pm ICT Sunday 01 January 2006</p>
  <li><p>Finished <em>Speaker for the Dead</em></p></li>
  <li><p>not started <em>Xenocide</em></p></li>
  <li><p>not spent any money</p></li>
  <li><p>not kissed anyone</p></li>
  <li><p>neither taught nor even planned any lessons </p></li>
  <li><p>not seen any aquatic animals</p></li>
  <li><p>started wearing sandals and shorts all the time</p></li>

</ol></p></li>

<li><p>We have not yet been to any ports.  Tomorrow, Vietnam will be
our first.  I wonder how my activities will be funded.  Fortunately,
it's still a pretty inexpensive country.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't written a mass email for my Rob Update; I will
likely do that today, though I don't remember there being an internet
cafe available in Da Nang or Hoi An.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been wearing a bracelet on my right wrist basically
continuously since Sri Lanka of the 49th voyage.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is 3.5 or 4 years old; I'm confusing myself about
the dates...  I've had it since before Japan, but the warranty has run
out, but I thought it was a four year warranty, but I don't think I
had it a full year before I came to Japan.</p>

<p>It's a Macintosh Powerbook G4 with 512Megs of memory, 30 Gig HD,
and 667 MhZ processor running OS X 10.4 (Panther) (although Tiger is
out, I haven't bought it, and probably won't for this machine),
CD-RW/DVD player, wireless card, 2 USB ports that I use frequently;
headphone, ethernet, firewire ports that I use occassionally; and
modem, speaker input, video output, and monitor output that I have
never used.</p></li>

<li><p>I think I can type about 50 wpm in QWERTY or 60 if I'm on a
roll, and maybe 15 wpm in Dvorak layout, in which my keys are arranged
physically, though right now they are in QWERTY mode.  Most people
that ask to use my computer seem to have not heard of Dvorak at all,
and find the seeming random arrangement flumoxing.  I am pretty
protective of my computer, so I don't mind this deterrent.</p></li>

<li><p>I thrive on emacs as my text editor, write all my own HTML and
try to keep my tags balanced and single tags /-closed.  I'm not a huge
proponent of WYSIWYG editors; I like to see what's really
there.</p></li>

<li><p>My domain is robnugen.com (hosted by webquarry.com in
California), and recently (esp. in terms of how long I've had the
domain (how long have I had it???)), just a few days before 27 October
2005, I got rid of my "landing page" and robnugen.com refreshes to
robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl, which automatically refreshes to
robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?type=all&amp;date=2006/01/01 (in the
case of today)</p></li>

<li><p>Just now was the first time I typed 2005 when I meant 2006.
Got that over with pretty quickly!</p></li>

<li><p>My top-bar navigation consists of text links to journal,
travel, YRUU, resume, blog, days old, then a Google search barfor the
domain, and then a note that says how many days old I am.</p>

  <ol type="i">
  <li><p>journal has a sublist of "types" of journal entries, which
  are identified by their filenames: all, SoML (where this entry will
  show up), excited (names include !), dreams, runes, YRUU, ultimate,
  KTRU, skate, sleepy (names include zz) and nihongo.  (I haven't
  written any/many runes, YRUU, ultimate, KTRU, nor skate entries
  lately).</p></li>

  <li><p>travel has a growing sublist: perhaps costa rica, japan, PB,
  Palestine.  I'd like to add TJ Bike to that one, but only once I
  really begin a multi-week journey at least.</p></li>

  <li><p>YRUU has links to Silent Football and perhaps the rallies I
  attended. (I am currently offline, being onboard TSS THE T0PAZ, so
  I can't check.)</p></li>

  <li><p>resume has a few (four or five) static pages that make up my
  resume.</p></li>

  <li><p>blog differs from my journal in that (generally speaking) my
  journal is my commentary on myself and my life, whereas my blog is
  commentary on external things (books, movies, etc)</p></li>

  <li><p>days old is a link to a page that lets people enter their
  birthdate and have it calculate the number of days old they are
  (according to California timezone), and then allows them to enter a
  number of days, so it can calculate the date they were/will be that
  many days old.</p>

  <p>I often wonder about Jason't request to put another date field on
  the page so it doesn't just default to today's date.  The logic is
  easy enough, but I'm concerned about making the interface too
  cluttered.</p></li>
  </ol>

<p>Regarding the "Rob is 13058 days old today" note (still visible in
my browser from a page loaded on 25 December), I am pretty proud of
the code I wrote for that.  I can't recall how it works exactly, but I
know the interface is pretty succinct, allowing a short line to call
code that does the calculation, between two dates (with a default
final date of today) or date + days to determine the new date, and
then display the result.</p></li>

<li><p>Most of the navigation on my site is done with a set of perl
programs that I wrote (save for the php files for wordpress that runs
my blog, and the indexing routing for my journal).  I conceived the
interface for the journal index, but Fred designed the architecture
and regexed it all together.  I've expanded that to allow for
different journal types, but the core code is still his.</p></li>

<li><p>Distinctly and grossly missing from my navigation is a link to
images.  There exists a program, images.cgi, that gives a crude view
of the photos on my site, but it's so hard to use that I simply
removed it.  I have been severely flummoxed by the display of
images for several reasons.</p>

  <ol type="i">
  <li><p>firstly because I haven't settled on an interface I like.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Secondly, I don't want to (re)move any of the existing images
  from the file system, which could cause a flurry of 404s.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>I would like to keep the existing meta information about the
  pics available, and use it in the new system (or overwrite it if I
  want).</p></li>
  
  <li><p>I would like to have ability to geo-locate the pictures on a
  map on my site, esp for travels to far away places.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>I want to easily have thumbnailed inline images in my journal
  entries.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Optionally, I'd like to have some pictures require extra
  access, either for high resolution images or, unlikely, for porn.
  Otherwise, I'd like to allow all the image directories to be browsed
  freely by anyone who cares to dig through them.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>I'd like to be able to easily find pictures by date, topic, or
  location.  I'd like an automated way to attribute pictures with that
  information, at least in batch mode of some sort.</p></li></ol>
</li>

<li><p>The nearest thing I've seen is basically flickr, but I'm not
willing to pay extra for it.  And I want it all hosted on my
domain.</p>

<p>I'm basically thinking a set of perl scripts and mySQL tables will
do the trick, holding meta-data and pointing to various URLs for the
image data.  I'm sure it's already been written, but I'd like to write
it myself.  Except that I've never written a project that big (and
not gotten paid for it).</p>

<p>If I do it, I hope I can do it well enough to have it enjoyed on
cpan.com</p></li>

<li><p>I'm using thunderrabbit at gmail.com to store all my email and
handle spam. anything at robnugen.com is forwarded to that
address.</p></li>

<li><p>I receive a daily log of hits on my journal and my days old
counter.  The journal gets about 200 hits per day and the days old
counter about 1 person (hitting about 3 or 5 times) every other
day.</p></li>

<li><p>I get an email notification every time there is a 404 on my
site with a http_referrer of my domain (implying a broken
link).  I should probably send those to a log file and forward them
once a day.</p></li>

<li><p>I have basically released the need to keep my American English,
allowing phrases from different cultures to come out as they
wish.</p></li>

<li><p>I have no girlfriend, and few hot prospects.  janette is the
one I wonder most about...</p>

<p>The others are just figments of my imagination, based on knowing
very little about the person (who lives far away) and having all the
blanks filled in with stuff I like.</p>

<p>I've done that several times, and try to keep in the front of my
mind the facts: I don't know anything.</p>

<p>I'm still sorry to Sally for having done it to her, but have never
taken time to apologize or otherwise make it right, though we have
communicated by email since then.</p>

<p>There is one more(!) <!-- Paige, who sailed on the 45th, 47th, and
48th PB voyages --> who I don't really know at all, but my silly brain
still wonders.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm quite curious how finances will come through tomorrow in
Vietnam.  I am tempted to find a sugar mama, but imagine I can work
out a massage deal.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm getting tired of writing, so I'll add some topics for
later: family, friends, art, pets, job, room, Francois, clothing,
spiritual, food/vegetarian, repeating, physical, education,
language</p></li>

<p class="date">7:58am ICT Monday 02 January 2006</p>

<li><p>I've been in pretty close contact with Fred; I talked to him
for 30+ minutes as we were leaving Kobe; he helped me do a Paypal
transaction.</p>

<p>Been in semi-close email contact with Ma, though haven't talked
to her in a while.</p>

<p>I got an email from Dad recently; he was like, "would love to hear
from you.." and I was like, "shit!" when I realized he was not on my
Rob Updates list.  I'm not in super close touch with him.  In a lot of
ways I feel like I try, but get limited response.  That may be less
true now, but the feeling remains from a couple years'
experience.</p></li>

<li><p>I've basically fallen out of touch with Genki Man Dan, but it
could be said I'm still in touch with Jen, though we haven't volleyed
an email recently.  I'm really happy to be slowly volleying emails
from peeps back at home (Houston), and from Nova and Gaba in Japan.
Can't really say emails are volleyed with peeps I met in Jerusalem,
but Sarah and I have sent a couple.</p>

<p>Dude and Fred have been my most consistent email connections.</p>

<p>The GET and CC team are my primary friendships now.  Dunno who will
likely last past the boat, save Carla, Kellie, Petra (who I knew from
before).</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't painted anything in months.  I think the last thing
was on the 49th voyage.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm sorta getting better at singing the blues; I can often
make funny rhymes that make sense in the situation.</p></li>

<li><p>I aints gots no pets, except for Spot, being cared for by
Jennifer in Houston.</p></li>

<li><p>I aints gots no job, except that I'm volunteering as a GET
Teacher on PB's 52nd voyage.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm living in room 3027, across the hall from 3029 (Carla,
Yuki, and Rei (Îè)) where I lived on 49th voyage.  My cool roommates
are Carl and Dan.  Carl and I often speak in hip-hop/ebonics (like
Dude and I).  Dan does occassionally.</p></li>

<li><p>I've still got Francois, the rabbit Colleen sent me in April
2003 when I first got to Japan.  He was unnamed at that time, and got
his name from Ai in the back of the bus with me on the Petra tour in
Jordan on 49th voyage.</p>

<p>People often ask me how old he is, and I tell them he's three years
old.  When asked where he is from, I say Jordan.</p>

<p>He understands English and French, but tends to keep comments to
himself.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm still using shorts and T-shirts and slacks and suit and
shoes from the US.  Hitomi has bought me several items in Japan.
Still have the dragon shirt Alicia gave me for Christmas (2002?)
Still have the THINK Shirt Maggie made me.</p></li>

<li><p>Every night, I enjoy the quilt and pillowcase that janette made
for me.</p></li>

<li><p>I claim no religion as my own, although what I've heard of
Buddhism seems to match what I believe about the greater reality
around us.  I believe basically that we live multiple lives in
physical form.  I believe there is no divine punishment for "sin"; I
say free will is not a gift from God if we are not allowed to choose
freely.  If God makes a rule, it's self enforcing.  The speed of light
is an example.</p></li>

<li><p>I've vegetarian if it's convenient.  On PB, I have a vegetarian
card, though I'll happily get food from the non-vegetarian
buffet.</p></li>

<li><p>Being a repeating teacher on the 52nd voyage has been quite
nice.  No huge shock as to wtf is going on, and I can support other
teachers in getting their bearings, and it's just really nice to be
home again.</p></li>

<li><p>My right knee is a bit ouchy, but it has been getting markedly
better each day.  I don't remember a specific injury, but I think I
knelt on it in a weird way or something and it kinda tensed up.</p>

<p>Otherwise I'm healthy as a horse.</p>

<p>I don't smoke, basically never drink alcohol.  I do chow lots of
sugar.  I can tighten my stomach muscles into a "six pack" and if I
count the smaller muscle on the ribs above, it's an eight
pack.</p>

<p>I don't work out; I find it boring, but I climb stairs a lot and
stay generally active.</p></li>

<li><p>I sleep on my back with my knees supported by a pillow and no
pillow for my head.</p></li>

<li><p>I have not gone back to school since I graduated from UH with
my BS in CS.  I have, however, taken some language courses: Spanish,
ASL, French, Japanese.  I'm pretty much crap in all of them, though my
Japanese is enough to make plans and tell stories with simple
vocabulary.</p>

<p>I'm considering going back for a massage therapy / psychology /
spirituality degree.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm also considering doing the 10 day Vippasana meditation
course once we get back to Japan.</p></li>

<p class="date">9:38am ICT Monday 02 January 2006</p>

<li><p>I changed $20 to Vietnamese Dong.  That should be hella plenty
for two days.  But it's all the US currency I had.  Except for a
nickel in the bottom of my suitcase.</p></li>

<li><p>I've not gotten ready to disembark the ship, but this entry is
finished, so I'll begin that now.  Probably.</p></li>

<li><p>Basic plan is to meet up with GET Ts tonight in Hoi An.</p></li>
</ol>
