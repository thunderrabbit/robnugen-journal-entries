_hanging out with Trent Reznor of nine inch nails (still?), I got to really ask him and hear some of his thoughts about stuff. I was like "oh I know what I can tell you that's personal, different than just 'omg I love your music' which is true, or I wouldn't be here now, but I feel sad that I didn't try to engaage you personally earlier. I mean I was listening to you in 1986 when Down in It came out.  And actually, I thought the lyrics for the refrain 'I was up above it' were 'How is everybody?' and they entire crowd answers back like ten thousand people screaming yeah [we are great]," and he interrupted a bit, "it cost 84000 dollars to make that, atually just to pay the students for that day cause we took an entire day with them and they each had to be paid 84 dollars so times a thousand, and we had to have only modern students who were also drivers," and he went into the details a bit and then someone called and apparently said, "yo trent this is Chuck we are at the airport now" and he said to them, "okay call me when you get here" and hung up, but then to me, "I have no idea who Chuck is; I doubt they know how to get here. I don't have time to answer to everyone's whim like I wish people knew I didn't._

_before that I had been hanging out with Fred, including at a hotel, overlooking a city where we had been playing for a while.  The night sky was crystal clear and he was showing me something about the cars on the street way down below us. He had some puzzles out on the table and I remember having played with them for a while before he had to put them away, but before he put them away, we were talking about this or that _

At the very end of the dream, I noted a tiny distinction between I'm asleep and I'm awake. or I noticed that the distinction was tiny. Why is that? What is that? I wonder how long I can ease around that distinction, experiencing it, and can I flip back from dream reality to awake reality to deam reality with ease? I should be able to, but how do I learn how to do it?
