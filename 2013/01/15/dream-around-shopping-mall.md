_Outside a large shopping mall, I was riding my bicycle searching for a specific store or searching for Fred to help him find the store or books that he wanted to find. I wanted to change some parts of the mall to make it easier for blind shoppers to navigate safely around; there were some unnecessary cubs and I considered ways to make them elsewhere so the traffic flow would be revitalized for the good of all the shoppers, bt then I noted that shopping is not for the good of the people but for the good of the economy which is for the good of the bankers and held back on doing any more shopping supportive activities_
