Browsing through free apps, I found [18000 cool jokes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/18-000-cool-jokes/id316973071?mt=8). Its meta-data includes

    "If there are any idiots in the room, will they please stand up?" said the sarcastic teacher.
    After a long silence, one freshman rose to his feet.
    "Now then mister, why do you consider yourself an idiot?" enquired the teacher with a sneer
    "Well, actually I don't..." said the student, "...but I have to 
    see you standing up there all by yourself."


I noticed "have" where they should have "hate" hahah ooops.

Looks like it's been that way for a while, but not since the beginning
