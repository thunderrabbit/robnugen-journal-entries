I've nearly finished the basic memory game where people try to find pairs of cards on the screen.  I am able to turn all the cards over with the touch of a button, and can ensure pairs of cards are displayed on the screen, and detect matches and remove them from the table if they match.   This is thanks to Ray Wenderlich's Snap! example, on his site.  I am likely to make a couple of the components be open source; I need to add a timer, and I have an interesting (?) idea on how to make one that I hope will be cool.  If it seems to work well, I might even submit it to Cocoa Controls, though I'm not sure how that process words.
