I had written "wow!  I five year plan with Lin and Mama!"

A-san-su is here with us this weekend; he told me a bit more about the family; Lin's mom and her husband used to have money, but frittered it all away instead of saving.  When Lin's dad was being a playboy they separated.

Trying to get citizenship in Japan, Lin's mom dropped her Taiwanese citizenship, which A-san-su suggests might have been better to keep.

So, the plan now is for Lin to work as a tour conductor for a few years here in Japan while I'm doing sbstrm and chatforest.  We'll focus on getting stuff together to get regain Taiwanese citizenship for Lin's mom (she was born there) and then we three will move to Taiwan by 2018.

Woohoo!  A 5 year plan!
