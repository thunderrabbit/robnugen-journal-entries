Today we went to Tokyo Skytree!   We had to reserve tickets a month in advance.   Only problem was we had made the reservations for tomorrow!  Derp!

I don't know how we got into our heads today as the date, but the tix are for tomorrow.  Lin, Ma, and Fred will go while I'm at work.

My ticket can be used within 30 days of its original date, so we might give it to A-san Su when he comes later this month.  Not sure yet.

So, instead of Skytree ascent, to Asakusa's shopping street we went.  Fred and I had gone yesterday with his friend Hiroshi (and Hiroshi's wife Masae), for Fred's first, and my second stroll down that street.  The most utterly packed shop yesterday was also packed today: the deep fat fried sweet yum yum shop had three registers, each with a line of about 3 people.  Fred said, "they're making them and selling as fast as they can, and they can't sell them fast enough [to keep the line down]."

We ate at a dessert shop on Orange Street.  It wasn't as ample as I had hoped, but my ice cream was served in a bowl suspended in a larger bowl of water with dry ice in it.

Weather got a bit chilly, so we were on the way home by 5:15pm, nearly 24 hours since Fred and I had met Hiroshi and Masae there the previous night.
