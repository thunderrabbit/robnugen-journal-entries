_Driving Mr Van with Colleen and my family, we arrived at a place where we had just been druing thew inter.  In winter the stream had lights and snow and looked quite different from no lights and no snow version as it was now.  Colleen commented on that and I was like, "yeah that was a once in a lifetime opportunity because I've heard they're not going to do the lights next year."  We turned right to go into the gated area and it was locked.  I jumped up to examine the lock, and the lock opened as I touched it.  I still had to disconnect the lock from the gate, and I found another button that did so.  They drove the van through after I kicked open the gate, and I was  still hanging on near the lock area but the gate stayed open.  My dad even drove the van on a door frame on the gate to keep it open longer but that didn't help close it as hoped._  Something else and then my alarm rang.
