Just had a long discussion with Lin, starting with _Lin's upset because Jana didn't reply to Lin's SMS_.

I tried to make Lin see that being upset about shit only hurts herself, but she only wanted, "don't worry about it, babychan; it's no big deal if someone doesn't reply to SMS."

At one point in the conversation, I wanted to give up and just lie down and cry.  I asked my angels for guidance and then asked Lin, "what can we do to make this better right now?"

Good question, and I gave her the original feedback she wanted.  (paragraph 2 above)

Lin wondered why I married her, given that she (perceives) she has all these flaws.

I said, "dude.  Jamie put it this way: LIN WINS and I agree; you are awesome.  I married you because you're courageous, excellent taking care of me, excellent with people."

[But I'm not creative; how can you choose me over Cecilia?]

Everyone can be jealous of something in everyone else.  Even the rich man can be jealous of the poor man's freedom.

That jealousy, I think, comes from seeing something that they already have, but for some reason, are hiding.  I know you are creative; I know you are smart.  But for some reason, you are hiding your creativity and your intelligence, possibly even from yourself.

Lin got up and sat in my lap, a sure sign that *I* win.

She goes, "I told Paola yesterday what a great husband you are."

"Thank you for being a great partner for me," I replied.

I'm glad I didn't give up the conversation.  Thank you angels for your support.
