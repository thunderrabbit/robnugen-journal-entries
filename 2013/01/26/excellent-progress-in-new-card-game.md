Tariq and I are creating a game of memory for iOS. This is my first project that uses blocks, and I must agree, they make coding a lot lot easier!!

This is my second big iOS project, a lot of which is based on [Matthijs Hollemans](https://twitter.com/mhollemans)' game [Snap](http://www.raywenderlich.com/12735/how-to-make-a-simple-playing-card-game-with-multiplayer-and-bluetooth-part-1) (currently without the multiplayer stuff), one of [Ray Wenderlich's excellent tutorials](http://www.raywenderlich.com/tutorials).

I've just gotten the in-game tutorial to work, though its alignment... isn't. Yay for blocks and tutorials and screenshots!
