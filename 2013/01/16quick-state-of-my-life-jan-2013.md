I just wrote this to my friend Laura

Hi Laura!!

You were in my dream last night!  We were at a party; I think it was my birthday.  Thanks for coming!!  You were standing a bit away from the party fracas, so were the first person I saw when I came in.  I was so happy to see you!!  We kissed a little bit and then you were like, "okay, that's enough, thunder buns" and then I woke up.

I've started doing morning meditations and writing again for my soul connectivity.  Lin and I are both working, she's working for a temp agency while looking for different full time work, including possibly overseas! I'm working for a startup which has just recently hired another guy, so we are up to four people now.   We do websites and mobile app development.

On the side, I'm doing iPhone app development with a guy; we have one app available in the US, and are working on another set of game apps now.

For a few days/weeks near the end of last year, I was doing a bit of genealogical research, just by interviewing a couple people in Lin's family who live here in Tokyo.   I put some of the data on [https://familysearch.org/](https://familysearch.org/) and was excited to see new names connected to some names I knew from my old research with you.  I found an ancestral link that extended back back back to some kings and queens.  I was like whoohoo!  Show me the money!!!   and then back back back to Jesus and I was like, whoohoo wait he had siblings???? and then back back back to Adam and Eve, labeled First Man and First Woman, and I kinda lost my interest.

Up to what have you recently been?
