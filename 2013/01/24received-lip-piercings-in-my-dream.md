_Was in south pacific island and was admiring the piercings of some of the locals.  An older guy held two needles in a downward non-threatening way and nodded his head toward me questioningly.  I was like "sure!" and approached him.  He  quickly and painlessly inserted needles in either side of my upper lip, then out a bit lower, so they didn't actually pierce into the mouth; just like subcutaneous, but not deeper than that._
