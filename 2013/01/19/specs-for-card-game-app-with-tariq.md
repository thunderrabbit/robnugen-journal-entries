Though we haven't started thinking about a name, Tariq and I have pretty well fleshed out version one of our first card game (during our 10pm - 12am meeting tonight).  He's still got to create some assets, and I've still got to do a good amount of programming, but I can clearly tell that my iOS skillz have increased a lot since our first app.

I probably shouldn't write skills with a z; I'm miles away from where I might hope to be in a parallel universe.

The game will be a bit difficult!  We plan something like 10 levels, but only chimpanzees will likely be able to finish the higher levels.
