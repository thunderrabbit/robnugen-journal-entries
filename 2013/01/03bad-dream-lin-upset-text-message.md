Lin, Ma, and I went to a university library where we were looking for books or something.  I saw Christine and helped her find a book (which was unavailable ever since a KTRU dj had mentioned its greatness on the air).  Christine needed the book for a report due in April, but the book cost $91 so she wanted to borrow it from the library.

It was time to go, but we couldn't find Lin.  I was looking around for her in the crowds of people chilling in the park-like atmosphere of the university campus.  I saw Fred had just arrived and was like, "yo have you seen Lin?" but he had not so I was like, "moe joe where is she?" and then I realized I hadn't checked my phone.  I checked and she had listed out all the reasons this is a bad relationship, in some sort of free-form brainstormed list.

`this is a bad relationship!`

first the gasoline
then the rice
nb kind of kid

somehow I am passing
my accounting class

yay

no thanks to you

And I started to cry and I slid the phone to my mom, "I found Lin," but she didn't hear me. moe joe, so thankful to wake up!
