##12:33 Monday 14 January 2013

Today is a holiday so I don't have to go out into the snow. Â yay!

Today is a holiday called Coming of Age Day, when <del>kids</del> adults(?) who will turn 20 this year all put on their finest kimono and attend an speech by the local leaders who say, "okay you're adults now; you can smoke and drink" and the kids at the back of the assembly get blasted on alcohol and make a big scene. (Anecdotal story from Lin)
