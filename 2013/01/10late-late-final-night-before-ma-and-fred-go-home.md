2:51am Thursday 10 January 2013 as I write this.  Just now about to go to bed after chatting with Lin a bit about the best way to get Ma and Fred to Shinagawa station.  She wanted to rent a car to Shinagawa, but I think a simple taxi ride one way to Kawasaki will be faster and cheaper overall.

Chatted with Fred at the monthly apartment while he packed.  When I Quit and Saved a Copy of the Minecraft Pocket Edition map from his phone to mine, the basement and one wall of our house was missing.   0.5.0 beta so I guess we came across a bonus bug.  We considered saving the files directly, but I was like, "nah it ain't worth it."  You gotta pack and we gotta wake up and go to work/airport tomorrow.

I carried home the heater Paola and Jon gave to us.  It's a liquid-filled radiator, so pretty heavy.  I used the same plastic twine stuff: two lines each double looped around nice round parts of the heater and the longer one over my shoulder and the shorter one in my hand, both with padding from the toilet seat cover / lid cover that are coming home as well.

Paola and Jon had us all over for dinner today: lovely fresh salad, lovely yummy rice-shaped pasta with chicken, and incredible desserts from Taiwan.  Paola had just gotten back from doing a vipassana course in Taiwan, which featured some food shopping after the course.

Today at work I was doing tests after [daemonizing the mailer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14211281/how-to-daemonize-a-php-script-to-be-run-with-upstart); I want to make sure it doesn't send double emails if multiple scripts are running at the same time.   But it sent several duplicate emails, moe joe.

Oh, and I came across [thinkup](https://thinkup.com) today.  I think I'll install it on my domain.
