_Dusk was approaching on a rainy night and we got a knock at the door. I opened it and a western looking guy wearing a backpack introduced himself. "HI; I'm Joe from Nagano," and I interrupted him, "you came from Nagano??" "yes". "Okay sorry please continue.." "and I'm was working in IT there but lost my job so I'm looking for IT work in Tokyo.." He was dripping a bit with rain, so I offered him to come in. He stepped up onto the wooden entry and I said "shoes off outside, please" and he stepped back outside. I then said "wait. I don't personally have work for you, but I have a contact who might. You look cold, so I'm offering to give you a warm place to sleep for tonight, BUT there is still some light outside; you can push on and maybe find a job, or you can come inside; it will be dark in about 30 minutes; you can come back after visiting a couple more houses._

He considered the options for a minute and then came inside. I said, "I'm Rob and this is Sabina," as Sabina came up to see the visitor. She's traveling as well so may be able to give a few tips on making money in Japan.
Sabina started asking him questions animatedly, and they hit it off right away. She took him into her room and closed the door; I could hear them talking as I started doing dishes, washing a large tray with a painted tree on it, actually a large tree in a forest of trees, with lots of green deep green with some of the paint chipping off. I started to scrape more paint off while washing and thought I should have gotten back in touch with Sabina sooner because now she'll think I'm just getting back to her because she has a new friend and she'll think I'm jealous. But really I've wanted to get back in touch the whole time but just didn't know what to say. So I made a decision to talk to her as soon as possible when she came back out of her room and then I woke up.
