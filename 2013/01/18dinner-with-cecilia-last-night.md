Last night we invited [Cecilia](http://balconyofdreams.blogspot.jp/) over to the house well we invited her on Sunday and Thursday was her and our mutually available day and Lin prepared lovely Texas BBQ in the form of green salad and carrot soup and bean burgers and bread and butter, lots of butter including raisin butter and the dinner was great and Cecilia a gave us lots of ideas on how to do what she calls permaculture, but it's not in the traditional sense of permaculture just for growing crops, but permaculture lifestyle so I am looking forward to implementing some of those, and hope one of us can attend her [upcoming workshops](http://balconyofdreams.blogspot.jp/2013/01/the-organising-fairies-how-permaculture.html) in Roppongi and somewhere else.
