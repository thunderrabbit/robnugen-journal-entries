**10:26pm Sunday 21 April 2013**

I apparently received an email on my iPhone.   When I unlock my phone, I have a screen that says so.  When I press the big green Dismiss button at the bottom, the screen persists.

So, either I have received 50+ messages (and have to press Dismiss for each one), or my iPhone is stuck in a loop out of which I cannot break without turning off my phone.

Granted, Ctrl-Alt-Del is the three finger salute of choice on Windows, so I guess its sibling can apply equally on iOS.

But srsly, I'm so unimpressed with the UX in my Apple products that I'm never going to buy another Apple device.
