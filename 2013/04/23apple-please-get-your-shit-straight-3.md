**8:44pm Tuesday 23 April 2013**

I'm trying to create a test account.  It's a test account, about which I do not care.  It cannot spend any real money; it's a test account.  BUT it has to have to have a real password, a birthdate, a first and last name, the last three of which are not used ANYWHERE.

But that's not why I'm bitching.

When creating the test account, I tried to use the email address c at robnugen.com, but an error message said I had already used it.  No, I'm pretty sure I haven't used it before.  I tried d; I tried e.  I tried asdf.  I tried fukcinggodamninfuriating, cause I'm pretty sure I haven't used that one.  Apple assures me I have.
