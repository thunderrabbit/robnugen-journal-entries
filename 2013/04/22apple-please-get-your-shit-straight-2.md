**6:52am Monday 22 April 2013**

A couple days ago I renewed my iOS developer account because our apps made *just* enough money to cover the cost of the developer account.

EVEN THOUGH the email address on my account has not changed, Apple sent me an email "to complete my purchase"  (wtf does that even mean?  My credit card was charged; the purchase has been completed!)


> Dear Nugen Rob,

So I clicked the link and it asked me to sign in. Why should I sign in when they sent me a confirmation link?

So I signed in and it asked me to enter my activation code.

wtf? Well maybe it lost its brain when I logged in. While still signed in, I went back to my email and clicked the link, which includes the code.

THEY STILL WANT ME TO ENTER THE CODE!!!!

Apple, please read Apple's "User Experience Guidelines" currently at [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/UEBestPractices/UEBestPractices.html](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/UEBestPractices/UEBestPractices.html) (though I'm sure that will change to a broken link in the future)

Anyway, Apple, please read your own UX Guidelines and fix the UX in your products. CLICKING A LINK IN EMAIL IS A SOLVED PROBLEM.

Bug report #13702641 posted

[![Screen Shot 2013-04-22 at 7.42.19 AM](/images/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-22-at-7.42.19-AM.png)](/images/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-22-at-7.42.19-AM.png)


> Summary: Email says "click the link" but resulting page says "enter the code (which was in the link you just clicked)"

Steps to Reproduce:

1) buy a developer account.
2) develop apps for one year, without changing the email address a single time
3) renew the same developer account
4) get an email a few days later "To complete your purchase and access your Apple Developer Program benefits, please click on the activation code below."
5) be required to log in
6) be forced to enter the code that was included in the link

Expected Results:

A) not have to click a link at all. I never once changed my email address; why is it sending me a link to my address?

B) not to have to enter the code that was in the link I clicked

Actual Results:

frustration that I paid 8000 yen and you're bothering me with crap and crappy UX

Regression:

Notes:

I know it's not your fault, dear person who's reading this, but damn, Apple tells us to deliver a nice User Experience, but doesn't do the same for us.
