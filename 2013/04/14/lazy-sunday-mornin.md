**10:25am Sunday 14 April 2013**

While chatting with Colleen we had a little earthquake.  Colleen wasn't impressed that I was unimpressed with earthquakes in general, but meh, most of them are no big deal.

Then, just moments after I saw the details of the earthquake posted online, a bowl broke in the kitchen!  It seems like an unrelated event, but one can never be too sure!  It was the small clear glass bowl that I liked using for granola, so I told Lin, "don't buy another bowl just to replace this one.   I can use the bottom of a larger bowl to hold the same amount of granola."
