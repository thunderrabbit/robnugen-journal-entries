I got a newsletter from Kii recently. I appreciate that the view online link is nicely mangled, and that I can unsubscribe with a click. Link to [funny kii newsletter](http://info.kii.com/news-and-happenings-from-kii-0?ecid=ACsprvuPm5aKrO3hwOeu-WTXky-ocAAjy31sWdfEWNzfnvGfMmibPWoAaWIY6V1Dph5ACEYtA-jd&utm_source=hubspot_email_marketing&utm_medium=email&utm_content=7817950&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-86snaij8f8aSSGCvmpbzpDL9490mZTG15t3Dy9qHlDFdgKS2Q1z-gDSQ2klUQFY7eRyfVfQFbI2oqbR_uCj1AEGbb1tnZTmwpKtCtmzNLUtY9ANZo&_hsmi=7817950).

The newsletter I received includes this "sample text"


> Hi Rob,

Describe what you have to offer the customer. Why should they read? What did you promise them in the subject line?
Tell them something cool. Make them laugh. Make them cry. Well, maybe don't do that...

Use a list to:

Explain the value of your offer
Remind the reader what theyâ€™ll get out of taking action
Show off your skill with bullet points
Make your content easy to scan
LINK TO A LANDING PAGE ON YOUR SITE (This is the really important part.)

Now wrap it all up with a pithy little reminder of how much you love them.

Aw. You silver-tongued devil, you.

Sincerely,

Your name



Ooops.  Well I guess they won't do that again soon.
