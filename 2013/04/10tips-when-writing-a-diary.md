**8:29pm Wednesday 10 April 2013**

Lin and I were both feeling kinda sick last week. I've not meditated in a while, though I might start soon. We're feeling mostly better now, but I've still got some congestion.

But that's not why I'm writing. Lin is talking about starting a diary. I'm fully supportive of such things, and hope she gets a lot lot lot and tons of benefit from it. Online or offline is fine; I can give her some tips and encouragement.

My main tip for any kind of diary writing, especially if you wanna do it for a while:

**write the full date at the top of every entry**. Or the bottom. Or both. But the point is do NOT just write 4/10 cause I promise, even if you can be sure you meant April 10th and not the 4th of October, you may be hard pressed to remember the year. And even if *you* can remember the year, someone who finds the diary after you will *not* remember the year. I use 4 digits for the year (how shortsighted of me!!!), always write the month out as a word, and almost always write the time as well, including am or pm.

The next most important tip might be the most important:

**start writing again if you have a lapse.** And don't try to catch up. In my handwritten journals, I remember having stopped writing because I got all busy. I wanted to write again, but I was like "ah crap; how will I write everything that's happened in 4 months?" That thought blocked me from writing for a month. Then I was like, "oh crap; how will I write everything that's happened in 5 months?" _That_ thought blocked me for a month until I realized the futility and just wrote what happened that day. I released the need to write about the prior 6 months and just started writing as if nothing had happened.

Other tips that are not as important, but may be useful



	
  * In a handwritten diary, leave a couple pages in front blank to be an index.  Fill it in with highlights once the book is full

	
  * Every month or year or so, write an overview of your situation. I got the idea from the State of The Union Addresses in the US; I call them State of My Life Addresses.

	
  * Only read old entries if it's been a year since you wrote them.  Otherwise, don't read; just write.
