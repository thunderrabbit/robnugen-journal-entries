##10:25 Saturday 20 April 2013

**10:20am Saturday 20 April 2013**

I had 24 free hours, and used up 14 in a couple weeks, so that's an hour per day.  2000 hours should last for 2000 days or until 11 October 2018.   For $48 * 2, not so bad.

I bought all those hours because today is the last day they are selling "prepaid time"
