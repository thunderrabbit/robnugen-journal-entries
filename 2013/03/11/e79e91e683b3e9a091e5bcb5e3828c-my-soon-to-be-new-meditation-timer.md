This weekend I mostly put together what I'm calling the [瞑想頑張れ meditation timer](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare), which is a bit like referring to "ATM machines" but hey at least it's two different languages.

It's now available on github: [瞑想頑張れ](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare) at [https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare).

There are several meditation timers on the app store, but I hadn't found one with the unique feature I wanted.

Sometimes when I meditate, I really get into it and don't want to stop when the original time is up.  And I would like to know how much longer I remained in meditation.  It's possible to reset the timer, but that pretty much breaks the meditative state for me.

So, [瞑想頑張れ meditation timer](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare) counts down the predetermined time, ... and then counts up until I click stop.  Simple.

The name comes from two words in Japanese that probably don't fit well together, but they work for me.  瞑想 can be transliterated as "meiso," and means meditation.  頑張れ can be transliterated as "gambare" and means something like "do one's best."

So, I hope it proves useful to me and others!

瞑想頑張れ is not yet available in the app store, but I hope to submit it within maybe a month.  Gotta get it polished a bit, plus put some icons on it.  I might strip out the FB stuff for the first version if I can't get it working soon.
