**9:45pm Thursday 28 March 2013**

A snake named Jeff was sleeping outside in the sun. He enjoyed the
nice breeze and white clouds floating softly in the sky. Then he saw a
cloud that looked just like an angel! He followed it as far as he
could, but then reached the sea and could travel no further. "Oh no!
How will i catch the angel?" he cried. Then he spotted a dolphin
splashing and leaping from the water. "Excuse me!" yelled Jeff, "can
you carry me toward that angel?"

The dolphin said, "certainly! but you have to give me something
first!" Snake didn't have much time so he said, "I don't have time
now, but I'll give you two things later!" The dolphin said, "okay;
that sounds good. Come slide onto my back!" and off they went.

The dolphin was a very fast swimmer and caught up with the cloud
quickly. By that time it had turned into more of a blob, so Jeff was
disappointed. "Well, I will give you two things. First, I'll name the
blob cloud after you. What's your name?" The dolphin said, "my name is
Harriet. What's your name?" "I'm Jeff," said Jeff. "It's nice to meet
you!" they said together.

Harriet carried Jeff back to the dock while Jeff tried to think of
another thing to give Harriet. They arrived at the dock and Jeff
realized what to give Harriet. "It's not ready yet, but come back in
one week, and I'll give you something!"

Harriet figured Jeff would not be there, but she came back to the dock
a week later. Jeff was looking quite clean! He was carrying a small
bag which he gave to Harriet. "What's inside?" asked Harriet
excitedly. "It's a part of me," replied Jeff. "Oh my god, it's your
skin! That's so gross and cool at the same time!!"

Harriet had never seen snake skin before, but she had heard of it.
Now she could show her friends!
