Lin and I are on the train from Paola and Jon's house; we were the
only two students in yoga class, so we got all the attention and all
the goodies after the lesson. Yummy chicken stew something, several
types of cheese + sembe, and a fruit pie with three or four types of
fruit jam filling. Yumm!

We went for an hour walk around Lin's former high school; Jon and I
talked about boy stuff while Lin and Paola talked about girl stuff.
There was a house under construction on the corner and its foundation
had just been poured, or had it? I put my foot on it to test... Wet
concrete!! Ooops hahahaha! Jon mad a bit of a mark and I was like,
"better not tell the girls," and we didn't. Funny that Lin is reading
over my shoulder as I type this (to the whole internettes).

After the walk, Paola suggested we watch a movie upstairs. I had
never been upstairs in her house, so it was a whole new experience for
me! Lin was like, "realllY??" because she's been upstairs so many
times hanging out with Paola. Paola pulled out a few Indian DVDs; Jon
and I were like, "well hmmm" as we read the synopses. Then when Paola
pulled out Fun with Dick and Jane, Lin was like, "yay!! let's see
that!!" and it was decided. Cute movie, and a nice surprise at the
end.

Afterward, we were going to go to the Pecha Kucha thing in Roppongi
tonight, but my head hurts, plus we'd be late arriving, so eff it;
let's go home.

Right now we are sitting in Shibuya station on the Inokashira Line
platform as I write, Lin plays on her phone, people and trains come
and go.
