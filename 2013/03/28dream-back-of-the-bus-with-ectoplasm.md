**6:15am Thursday 28 March 2013**

_Riding in the back of a bus, after there had been a pretty devastating earthquake, but we were still trying to go somewhere, and the driver had to back up a try again to go this way or that way around the city to get to where we were going.  I was sitting in the back, and Lin was sitting a few seats ahead of me.  I had the whole back seat to myself and at one point the bus had to bak up and it seemed to tilt a bit precariously, and I was glad no one was in the seat with me because if we tipped over, it would mean they'd all fall onto me, or me onto them and it would have been a mess.  With no one, then I could just stand up on the side of the window  or something._

_Then there was an older woman sitting next to me and she had also done some classes with Clairvision, so we were talking a bit  and I showed her a book I was reading, and then the woman across from the table across the table from us was like interesting book and asked if she could look at it.  When she opened it, a small sponge fell out; apparently it had been inside the book. I kind of remember having putting it in the book, and I could see some of its sides had been damaged from being smushed in the book,but it still had its pyramid shape when unsmashed,   There was a pin in it, so I  tried not to smash it and be pricked with the pin and I warned the woman next to me oh there's a pin, and then I noticed there were a lot of pins, and the woman across the table had a lot of pins in a pin cushion as well.  I was like, "is this yours then?  and she looked at it like, no it's not mine.. and then another book fell out of the first book; it was an introduction to unitarian universalism, and I handed it to the woman next to me while the woman across the table continued reading the first book. _

_Then another woman came up and asked "for a free reading," which I thought was a bit rude at first, but then noted that she had green ectoplasm just oozing out of her temples, like something had really gone wrong.   I wondered if it was real, and the woman next to me said, we're probably seeing some kind of after effect and it may phase in and out of view, a and as the woman was talking her far  the affected woman was talking her face became like a skull and dry white hair and emaciated gross but still talking and wondering what was happening.  I sat and tried to maintain composure and then noted her color came back, her hair turned to a healthy black perm and she looked like Julia Roberts with a black perm and she was still talking, and the ectoplasm had vanished and everything seemed a lot better. Then as she began to change back to skeleton ectoplasm straw white hair, I interrupted excitedly, "you know what?  you look just like Julia Roberts! I just realized that" and then I thought to myself, "oh crud I hope she likes Julia Roberts" and the woman goes, "really?  that's so sweet!" something something and  her face kept turning into a skull and grossness and then I woke up._
