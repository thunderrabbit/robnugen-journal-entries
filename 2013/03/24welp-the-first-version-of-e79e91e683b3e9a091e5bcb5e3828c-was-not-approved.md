By the first person who looked at it, 瞑想頑張れ was rejected for being too simple.  I wrote in an appeal (which I forgot to save for posting here) that said "yeah but it has the one killer feature that all other meditation timers lack!"

It's still available on github, but not nearly as easy to install that way.

Hopefully the appeal will appeal to the next person, or my planned updates will make the difference to get it approved.
