Lin and I watched [You've Got Mail](https://www.jinni.com/movies/youve-got-mail/), which I had never previously seen.Â  Meg Ryan's character reminded me a lot of Wende, both because she reminded me of Wende and because Wende likes Meg Ryan.

I rated the movie as "great" on [Jinni, my favorite movie rating site](https://www.jinni.com/), though I have typed jenni.com many times when searching for it.
