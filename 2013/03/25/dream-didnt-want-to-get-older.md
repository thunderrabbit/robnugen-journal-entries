**3:40am Monday 25 March 2013**
_Sho was discussing with Jonas about a new site, and I wanted to work on something but didn't have enough information to get started on my site.  I tried to get back to work and the scene shifted._

_At our old house again, my mom went outside to sleep in the pullman trailer and I went to my old rom. I heard a noise with sounded like the neighbors pulling trailers around so I went outside to make sure they were only pulling their own trailers.  the light was on inside but both switches were off, so I tried to turn the right one on, but then just went outside and found my mom reading in the back of a station wagon and she was like "I was just reading something you wrote; was this recent or a long time ago?  you said 'I don't wat to grow old'" and I was like, "well I can't imagine it was recent; I don't remember it; maybe I was 9 years old"_
