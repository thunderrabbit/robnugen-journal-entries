I submitted [瞑想頑張れ](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare) a few days ago.   It's not approved yet, but I'm going to add on some bits, right after I go through [Beginning Storyboards tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/5138/beginning-storyboards-in-ios-5-part-1).

hmmmmmm I just added the time above, and realize I would like a way to paste the current time + day + date like I did in my previous journal entries.   With wordpress, I only have the date in the metadata, not in the entries themselves.   Maybe a little clock widget on the new-post page will do it.

I'm going to resist searching for that now until I go through the tutorial, at least.

moe joe I wasn't able to get the prep time working on the timer yet.  I was able to add a second view controller which returns the requested time, but I haven't been smart enough to get that time into the pre-meditation time timer.
