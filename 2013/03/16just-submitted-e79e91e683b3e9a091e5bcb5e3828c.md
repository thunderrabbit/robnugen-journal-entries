Standing in the 2nd floor of the Shibuya Apple Store, with my phone charging on a display computer, I created an icon for 瞑想頑張れ and submitted the app to Apple for approval.  Whoohoooo!

The icon looks something like this:

I know I dropped the れ, but I hope I used the right kanji!!!

Here's a link to the [姪御頑張れ commit I first submitted to Apple](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare/tree/c6214f2ba1dcd10223adfd226a63049f66169ac3).
