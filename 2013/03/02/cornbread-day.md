##09:25 Saturday 02 March 2013

It's a Saturday as I write this, and it happens to be a lazy Saturday as we've got nothing planned, per se.  Lin is making cornbread, and I just watched the first episode where Nibbler turns out to be smart.  Interestingly, given that the characters don't remember the happenings of the episode, I don't remember ever having seen this episode before, though I had seen the one before it.

This is the second time that Lin has made cornbread; the first time was about a week ago, and quite yummy!

I think I shall write a state of my life address, my first in a while.
