**10:09pm Thursday 28 March 2013**

Theodore the Crow was hungry. It was cold and he had no where to go.
Then he saw a light in the window of a cabin far way. He flew toward
it and landed outside the window, wondering how he could get inside.
He pecked on the window to get the attention of the man sleeping
inside, but the man had just finished another flagon of ale and
wouldn't stir until nature called in the morning. Theodore was
content to wait; the window was a bit warmer than outside, and he had
no where else to go.

Cindy the Cat saw Theodore's silhouette in the window. She thought,
'mmmm dinner will be nice' and stalked Theodore with the intent of
eating him. Theodore didn't hear anything as she crept silently
toward him. By chance, he thought he felt someone looking at him, and
turned around just as Cindy was within swatting distance.

Theodore, though cold and hungry, was a sharp witted crow. "Hello,
there!" said Theodore happily. "Did you come here to get out of the
cold?"

Cindy looked surprised for a moment, "no actually," she started. "I
came to eat you."

"To meet me?" the crow lied. "How very sweet! My name is Theodore; what's
your name?"

Not wanting to be rude to food, Cindy answered plainly, "I'm Cindy," and
paused, then added "nice to meet you."

"Oh it's so good to meet you too!" laughed Theodore. I've not met a
cat in many years. I just delight at seeing what incredible sense of
balance you have!"

"What do you mean? You can balance on a thin wire; I can't do that."

"Yes, that's true," agreed Theodore, "but I have to use my wings to
balance, but you don't have any wings!" With that, Theodore leapt up
into the air and flew toward the beams supporting the porch roof.
Cindy was much quicker, though, and caught him in mid flight.

Nom nom nom.
