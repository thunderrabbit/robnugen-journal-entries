Thanks to Matt's suggestion of making the object instantiations look like a tree, I've got 楽しい発音 working without any pesky crashes caused by my confoozed way of using blocks.  Today I actually added some functionality that was not in the previous version: now I can display sets of words instead of just all the words.  Word.
