**12:14pm Sunday 19 May 2013**

Though it's a lot slower than Wordpress (and only version 0.8.2), I'm enjoying using [Koken](http://koken.me/) on my site; it looks beautiful and seems to handle images more inclusively rather than as a tacked-on thing.

So for a while, robnugen.com/blog may see fewer entries while I play with robnugen.com/koken.

If I really like it, I'll make /koken be default for my site.
