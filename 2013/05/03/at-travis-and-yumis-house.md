**6:42pm Friday 3 May 2013**

Chillin' with Travis as Yumi and Lin magic up some yummy dinner (some of which was made by Travis).  Deji may be coming over for dinner or maybe after dinner; Travis wasn't able to tell from Deji's email. 

Travis made a 3D maze for me!  It's not quite 3D so much as it's layers of 2D.  It's drawn on a hexaflexagon!!!   He used Haskell to output SVG which he printed then folded the maze. Sweet!!

And now, dinner!!

I love how well Lin and Yumi get along.
