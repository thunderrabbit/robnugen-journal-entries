Thanks to Rohini and [Movies That Matter Tokyo](https://www.facebook.com/MoviesThatMatterTokyo) crew for presenting [Sirius](http://siriusdisclosure.com/sirius-film-2/) and Q&A; by [Greg Sullivan](http://jceti.org/?page_id=52) of [jceti.org (Japan Center for Extraterrestrial Intelligence)](http://jceti.org/)

The movie presents four phenomena: many people have information about UFOs and are beginning to talk about it, free energy has been available for some time, there's a coverup of this information from the secret government, and a [small humanoid body was recovered in Acatama](http://siriusdisclosure.com/evidence/atacama-humanoid/), Chile.

In the Q&A; with Gregory, I asked if I can see in Tokyo or build for myself a free energy device.  He said the problem is not in the technology so much as our spiritual development; are we ready for free energy?

He leads CETI groups here in Japan; I'd like to attend one!   Seems they just had one this weekend.

There are [several more screenings of Sirius](http://jceti.org/?page_id=91), and then in July another CETI event.  Nice!

To quote Jules, "I'm goin'; that's all there is to it."
