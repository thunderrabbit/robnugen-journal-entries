**7:55pm Sunday 5 May 2013**

Today I went to Yodobashi Camera to buy a camera, but I wanted to confirm that it would work with my computer before purchase.  They didn't seem to have *any* web cameras out of their boxes, so I figured I wouldn't be able to test one before buying.

Rather than try banging my proverbial head against the unbendable rules, I went to Bic Camera to see if they had cameras I could use.  They did; it worked as I hoped,*and* they were less expensive than at Yodobashi.

I bought a cute little camera for 1980 yen and today, officially started working on Marble Track 3.

I had built a tripod for my waterproof camera, but I couldn't get the camera to work with FrameByFrame, nor with iStopMotion.   I needed a bit taller tripod for this camera, so augmented it with some chopsticks and got started making my movie.  Nice to be making stop motion animation again!

Finished 350 photos in about 3 or 4 hours.  They included a guy coming onto the set, motioning Rabby to pull the marble track base onto the set, and then adding 8 pairs of popsicle sticks to the track.  Nice!

Showed Lin and she was like "yay!!"

Then clicked save and FrameByFrame crashed after saving 50 of my 350 photos.

Sigh.

I think I'll buy iStopMotion, assuming I can find no reviews claiming that it crashes a lot.

<del>Here's my setup and the first 15% of the images I had taken.</del>

Sigh Wordpress.   Here are some sideways images because wordpress can't rotate images over 2 MB.
