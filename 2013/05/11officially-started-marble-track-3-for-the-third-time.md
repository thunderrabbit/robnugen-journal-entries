The first time I started Marble Track 3, I was living in Motosumiyoshi.  I worked on it for a few months, iirc, before losing my job and moving to Soness's living room floor for two years.  The track was shelved and never finished, though I did work on it a bit once Lin and I moved to Kawasaki, but then part of it was broken and it got shelved again when I started working on iPhone apps with Tariq. 

I started a new Marble Track 3 about a week ago, finished 17 seconds of animation before losing 80% of said animation due to getting what I paid for with free software.  

Payday arrived yesterday and I bought a new marble track base (actually three new bases), and a license for iStopMotion after confirming it was more robust than FrameByFrame.  

Four and a half hours later, this is how far I've gotten.

So far, there are two (2) pieces glued to the base.  Looks like this is going to take a while.  :-)
