I've finished 56 seconds so far of Marble Track 3. The white and pink characters are gluing the 180 degree turn in the second corner (of four corners). I've got plans in mind for the two center tracks.. hmm maybe I can scribble a bit on a photo. brb.

Okay so in the lower right corner, the white and pink guys are placing pieces for the second of four 180 degree turns in each corner.

In the lower left corner, the yellow guy with green backpack is placing a retaining wall on the first 180 degree turn that they made.

The green guy in the back is the cutter; he has nothing to do right now, so is just waiting.

The (future) 180 turns are marked with (dashed) black lines.

The red lines mark where the marbles will arrive after navigating the 180 degree turns.

The red spots on the edge of the center line mark where marbles will arrive after navigating the light blue and light green lines.

The light blue and light green dashed lines show where they marbles will roll before that.

The yellow dashed lines show where the marbles will probably roll before arriving at the 180 degree turns.  I'm not sure what I'll do at the point marked with a yellow question mark.  I might make a switch there, but it's so low in the track that it wouldn't be very interesting.

I might have a switch there that decides between a red line arrival and a red dot arrival.

That's a decision for later, though; right now we're waiting for the glue to dry in the lower right corner so we can place another piece.
