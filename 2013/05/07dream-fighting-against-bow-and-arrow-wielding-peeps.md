**6:54am Tuesday 7 May 2013**

_We had been retreating but I realized it was "that place where I can control things" so I went toward them firing arrows at me.  I wasn't hit/hurt by any arrows and I got close enough to shoot some of them, but didn't because it wouldn't be nice, so I found an old cave where we had had a school or something and went down into it and turned right behind an old saloon that was filled with chairs and stuff.  I leapt up to the second floor balcony and was able to move some plywood out of the way so I could close the shutters and wait there for the war to be over._
