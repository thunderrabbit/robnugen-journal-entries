I've finished a minute and 21 seconds worth of Marble Track 3 video.

There's exactly one piece that crosses over another track.  In the image below, the pink character is standing on that piece which is marked with black.

The other pieces marked in black are the continuation of that track, which ends in the lower middle of MT3. (hmm I'm using the word "track" to describe a single track and "track" to describe the entire thing.)

Parallel to that track is marked in purple.  The purple dotted piece has just been cut by the green guy, who is about to cut where the purple line crosses the piece.

On either outer edge, light blue and light green lines mark the tracks so far.

The white guy with green head is about to pick up sticks to have them cut and cross the end of the black track with the purple track.

Yellow guy with green backpack is going to take the cut pieces and place them as berms on the lower right 180 degree turn.  Pink and white guys are going to place the piece Pink is holding; it will be the second piece to cross over another track.

But first, I'm going to the iOS meetup in Shiboooyah!
