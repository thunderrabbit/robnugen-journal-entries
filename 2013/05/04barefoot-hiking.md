**~11am Saturday 4 May 2013**

We're walking on a gravel road which I'm having a bit of pain navigating, especially while I'm typing this on my phone.

**14:52 Saturday 4 May 2013**

We had lunch on a rocky 'island' in the riverbed. A couple of us got wet on the way to the island, me more intentionally than another. After lunch, including lots of community food, I took a little nap, enjoying the warm sun when it was visible between clouds.

Headed back, we didn't use lights in a pretty long tunnel. It seemed pitch black for a bit; I liked that part.

Outside the tunnel (or maybe a different one; there were many), Yuri had us try synchronized jumping for a photo. I don't know if we got a shot with everyone in the air!

According to Travis's pedometer, he walked 28,000 steps. My pedometer app said 25,000. I kinda trust his more.

The four kanji are the name of the tunnel.  As best I can tell, they mean "stone collapse tunnel"  [石崩隧道](http://translate.google.com/#ja/en/%E7%9F%B3%E5%B4%A9%E9%9A%A7%E9%81%93)

There were many fences built along cliffs to keep rocks from entering the road
