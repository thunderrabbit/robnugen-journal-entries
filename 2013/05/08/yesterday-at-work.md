**6:38am Wednesday 8 May 2013**

Yesterday at work I got the pagination to be ajax driven if javascript is enabled and GET driven if javascript is not enabled.

I've started to cut a couple corners as the project is a bit overdue. Â For example, instead of figure out how to redisplay the same units when clicking back to the map page (I'd probably use Lawnchair), I just open units in a new tab.
