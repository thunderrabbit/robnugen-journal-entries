Worked on Marble Track 3 some more today.  This time the green cutter guy cut four ice cream spoons, the pieces of which were distributed to the four corners of the track. I've started gluing pieces at one of the corners.  I'll probably place some pieces on the two tracks that end along the center line of the track.

I just added five more images and glued one more piece.
