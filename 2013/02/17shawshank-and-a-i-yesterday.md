When I got home from the iOS meeting, Lin was watching Shawshank Redemption on TV via our [video-on-demand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_On_demand) service. I joined her once the final rape scene was over; up to that point, I don't really like the movie. When the final credits rolled, I said, "oh, I thought that was Tom Hanks," and she was like, "no that was Green Mile." I was like, "I've never seen Green Mile," and she goes WHAT?? and I was like, WHAT??? and she was like WHAT???? and I was like WHAT??? for about a minute.

She's been wanting to see A.I. as well so she went and rented A.I. and Green Mile for 100 yen each.   I chose to watch A.I. instead of Green Mile last night because A.I. is shorter, and I've never known Lin to watch an entire movie (late at night on our couch) without sleeping.

I've seen A.I. a couple of times, and when I watch it, I always think of Chez who was really moved by the movie.

I didn't cry this time while watching it, though I have in the past.

We did watch the "making of A.I." this time, whereas I hadn't in the past.  I wonder [how Kubrick died](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+kubrick+died) (_he types, while seated in front of a portal with high speed access to essentially all of humankind's information_).

I was reminded of an interesting article about Kubrick's "The Shining" as his confession that he helped make footage for Apollo 11 missions.   [kubrick+shining+apollo+11/a>](http://www.google.com/search?q=kubrick+shining+apollo+11)
