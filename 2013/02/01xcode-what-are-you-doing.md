I'm trying to get some work done; I'm trying to give my time and money to Apple so I have a chance to make a nickel.

Why is the provisioning process so obtuse?  Am I just an idiot who can't figure it out?

Why does Xcode have so many bugs?  Did I write it?

As I write this, Xcode is locked up.  Apparently I'm going to have to force close it.

See how that little spinner isn't spinning in this image?  That's exactly how it's not spinning on my computer.
