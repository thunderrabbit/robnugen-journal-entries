Thanks to the incredible [Sim Aquarium 3D](http://simaquarium.com/) we have an aquarium above our kitchen sink!

What an amazing world.

I can see several points where the app could be improved with future technology, but I've honestly never seen any computer technology so closely approach the look of a live aquarium.

My suggested future development, possibly in order of easiest to hardest:



	
  1. larger background so rotating the device doesn't force zoom-in

	
  2. make fish out of focus when further away

	
  3. add crustaceans

	
  4. give fish some flaws (nibbled tails, scratches)

	
  5. add dust particles when fish swim near the bottom

	
  6. let the fish interact with each other (schools, chasing, fighting)

	
  7. make the background 3D instead of just an image
