I wonder wtf happened.

**We are performing maintenance on the provisioning service. All provisioning requests will remain in pending status until maintenance is complete, at which time all pending requests will be automatically processed.**

I took this screenshot last night at 11:22pm. It's now 7:34am as I write this, so it's been down for more than 8 hours.

[People on ASE are wondering as well](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/82153/for-how-long-is-apples-provisioning-service-typically-down), but not as many people are wondering as who are saying it's not a good question.

[Apple system status](http://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) implies all is good.

I don't imagine my support suggestion will make a difference.
