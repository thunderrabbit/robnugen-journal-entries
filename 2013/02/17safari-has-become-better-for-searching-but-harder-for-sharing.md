Regarding the [new Safari search bar](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4136899?start=0&tstart=0):

I'm glad that I can just type keywords and Safari knows I'm not trying to search for the invalid URL https://funny%20cat%20videos

But now all I see is "funny cat videos" where I would like to see the URL https://www.google.com/search?q=funny+cat+videos

The interwebs are based on the concept of hyperlinks, not hypersearchterms. It's a pain for me now to use Safari to create links for sharing.

Maybe Safari is simply trying to hide [Google's new improved Â URLs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7097270/whats-up-with-this-google-url)
