Lin and I "babysat" for her sister's daughter Mikako, nicknamed Mikarin. We played memory with a full deck of cards and each won once. We played Othello twice (Mikako beat me, then I beat Lin). Lin took a nap; we all ate cake.

Then when Baba got back to the house, we ate at the smokey restaurant and then Lin and I went home.
