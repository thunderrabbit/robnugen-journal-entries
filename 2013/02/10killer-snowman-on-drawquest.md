I just thought of a new idea for [DrawQuest](http://drawquest.com). Â I can't show the full animation here, but if you have an iPad, download the app, and find me (thunderrabbit), you can see it.

I drew a snowman who then thought about killing his maker, but then the dog barked and the snowman reverted to his normal happy state.

This works easily because the eraser too erases down to the original image, not down to the blank canvas.
