Tariq and I worked on the card game yesterday for about five hours. Â Lin was out with her aunt and uncle so I cooked the pizza Lin made so Tariq and I enjoyed that during our work time.

He suggested a complete overhaul of the side menu, that which was supposed to be "the same for all our card game apps."

I was like moe joe at first, but after thinking about it a bit, the suggested solution does solve several problems, including UI and UX.

It causes a couple of problems for me in the coding department, but it's just a simple matter of programming.
