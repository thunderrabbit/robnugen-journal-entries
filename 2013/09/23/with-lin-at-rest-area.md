Lin and I are at a restarea; I've just coded up the new class in my
latest iPhone project.  I designed it and wrote out the functions on
the way to Mt Fuji yesterday.

"This morning" we woke up at 2:10am to climb Mt Fuji.  I took notes,
which I hope to transcribe into here, but in case I don't, the TLDW
(too long didn't write) version is: "10 hours up; 4.5 hours down."  In
the extra space, I'll write "Saw four guys carrying mountain bikes up
the mountain (but didn't see them ride down)"
