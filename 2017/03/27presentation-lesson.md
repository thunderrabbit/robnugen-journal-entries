This morning we reviewed last week's article about Nissan having been
selected to provide New York City taxi minivans until 2024.  Talked
about the benefits of the taxis from the points of view of different
people: passengers, drivers, owners.  Then we did mock sales
presentations, tailored to our imaginary audiences.
