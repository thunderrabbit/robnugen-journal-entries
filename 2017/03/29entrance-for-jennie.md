I just bought three styrofoam blocks for Jennie.  She is currently
able to leap from our balcony onto the sunroom roof below, then climb
down the nearby tree.

She can barely jump back up, and doing so requires her to balance on
the edge of the gutter.  The dusty slightly sloped plastic sunroom
roof does not give her enough grip to leap from it.

So, my plan is to make a set of stairs for her to more easily ascend
and more quietly descend.

There's a slight risk that other cats will be like "hey meow, I can do
that," and try to come inside, but it's worth the risk.  I think
there's a greater risk of Jennie jumping down one day and cracking the
plastic roof of the sunroof which would certainly be more expensive to
repair than 3500 yen for these blocks.
