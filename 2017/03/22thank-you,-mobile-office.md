At home, I set up a URL that I could reload repeatedly to process N
records at a time.  I logged in to the site on my phone and repeatedly
loaded it while walking to the train station, and now while on the
train, I just now used my phone's wifi tethering option to rerun a CSV
create script after all the records had been updated.  This was for AB
and I was able to send AB the CSV from report 216.

Crossing fingers the data is all correct. :-3
