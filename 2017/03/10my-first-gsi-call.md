Good morning!(?)  Wow sleepy.

Today is my first time to join the <del>international suppport
group</del> <ins>Global Support Team</ins> call.

I plan to ask how to find the best match for a sponsoring community.

    We might not use it, but will have people to contact, in case of
    need choose community I feel will support me.
    
    dont worry about upside down directions.  its about who I can get
    support from energetically.  strongly consider making a connection
    in not so distant future.
    
    prioritize geography.  Hawaii, NZ
