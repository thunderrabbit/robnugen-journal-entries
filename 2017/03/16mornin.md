1. The US shifted their clocks forward, so my online I-group now meets at 9:30am Tokyo time.  That means I do not have enough time to head home before the meeting, and that means I need to find Wifi.  I've been using Wired Cafe in Lazona, and I will probably resume.  It also means I have my computer with me for this morning lesson to which students are often late.
2. Been doing lots of work for AB.  Added a field.. actually split a field into two pieces.  I thought date_available and date_marketable were the same.  False.  Well they have been the same in the DB for 6 years, so kinda true.
3. While doing all that work, I should be preparing to move them to Ubuntu 16.04
4. Apparently the CB project will end in June.  I hope it's not foolish to hope it's conceivable that it could possibly go smoothly.  Just sayin' I miss having a project manager who can push back against certain requests.
5. I just taught a trial lesson yesterday for It's Me.  They were beginners, but genki and tried pretty hard.  First lesson starts a month from now; have to wait for new annual business cycle to start.
6. I gave a copy of Simon's book to Patrick.
7. TY had a baby!
8. I've been going to SOGO since like August 2016.  I just invited Menya to my HHS presentation on March 28th.
9. I'll be presenting Head Heart and Soul on March 28th.  It's basically an introduction into the type of emotional clearing / personal growth we do in my men's group.
10. I built a cage with chopsticks to surround my glass desk with a protective cat shield.  Inside the cage (which can be easily removed by people with thumbs (haha, cat!)), I plan to make a marble track.  Expect it to start soon after April.
11. In addition to weekly online I-group, I attend monthly I-group council call (being the representative for all the I-group<del>s</del> in Japan), and monthly Community Growth call (being that Japan has only one I-group).
12. One of the things suggested by the Community Growth team is to have patience.
13. I have not been meditating regularly.
14. I just started bringing my disk to SOGO so we can throw a bit after workout.  Only one taker 12 days ago, but about 4 people this past Sunday.
15. Student just arrived 11 minutes late.

16. The morning weather was 2 degrees C, basically too cold for me to happily go barefoot, but it got up to 12 C today, which is relatively great barefoot weather.
17. I really enjoy teaching students who enjoy learning.  I wonder how long I can do it.
18. I've been watching Mythbusters on Netflix.  I'm up to Season 4 now I think.  Interesting that Scottie just vanished from episodes, replaced by Grant without fanfare.  I hope she left on good terms.
