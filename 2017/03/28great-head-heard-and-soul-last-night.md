11 people in attendance, 8 of whom had not seen the presentation
before.  This was the second time for me to present Head Heart and
Soul in Tokyo (or anywhere).  I did not look at my notes, and did it
all from memory, except the parts I forgot.  Gotta practice more
before next time.

Great conversation at Zest afterward.
