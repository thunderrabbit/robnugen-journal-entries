I needed to make a cloze test today.  All the ones I saw online were
either hard to use or required payment (or both?)

In my preferred version, user would just slap in a bunch of text, and
then click on the words to extract from the source.  Those words would
be replaced with blanks and moved down to sorted list at bottom.
