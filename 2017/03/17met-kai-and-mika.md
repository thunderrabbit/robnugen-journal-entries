Last night I met Kai and Mika 久しぶり！We met near Mika's work for
dinner (I got lost on the way due to trusting Google maps which had
been given incorrect input, and ended up taking a taxi (only 410 yen
(wow!)) after realizing I had walked wayy off course) and then got ice
cream whereupon they suggested I do something crazy.

In July, there will be an event where untrained people can *conduct*
an orchestra!

My first reaction is holy shit no way because I have no idea what I'm
doing everyone will laugh it will suck... wait a minute.  where is all
this fear coming from?

I trust Kai and Mika.  They say it will be fun so by golly I am going
to apply!
