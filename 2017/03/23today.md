## 15:33 Thursday 23 March 2017 JST

Bleary eyed wake up with [Noisy](https://wiki.robnugen.com/wiki/Items:Noisy) at 5:30am.

Was genki and dancing around by 6am to wake up Lin.

cold cold walk to station and caught 6:?? train then in Kawasaki by
7:30 for my 7:50 lesson.

Online I-group after the lesson featured lots of disconnects by the
free wifi provided by Wired Cafe.  But free, for the price of lunch.

Bought a trackball mouse afterward.  It works fine, though I do not
have a name for it yet.

Had a snooze on the train to Akihabara, and am now here at conveni
across the street from my lesson at 6:30pm.

Oh, on the way here I messaged a man who lives in Tokyo.  He said he'd
be interested in our local I-group.  yay!
