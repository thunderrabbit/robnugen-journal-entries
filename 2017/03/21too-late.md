## 12:17 Tuesday 21 March 2017 JST

Yesterday was a holiday, and happily enough, I basically took the day
off.  The previous two days I had been up working until an average of
4am.

Today I just read HN and now about to work on Ansible playbooks again.

But first, a silly thing I just made up:

    A: 鍵はどこかな?
    B: 車内じゃない？
