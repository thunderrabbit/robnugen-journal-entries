Great fun with Lin and Mikako yesterday, meeting and eating pizza in
Jiyugaoka at Napolis.  Cheesy four-cheese pizza for me and different
pizzas for them, then (by way of a jewelry store) to Jonathan's where
we had dessert.  I had probably too much dessert, but it was yummy
even so.  Got pictures with Francois.
