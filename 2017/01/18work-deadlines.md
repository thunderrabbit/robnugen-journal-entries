I know I didn't say I could definitely finish.  At the start of this
year, they were like, "oh god the competition has ABC!  We need ABC
too!" yeah well ABC has been available for 6 months.  Asking me to
spend 8 hours to catch up to what they've done in as long as 6
months is not something I would have said I could do.
