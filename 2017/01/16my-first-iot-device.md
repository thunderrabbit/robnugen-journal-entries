I'm considering my first IoT device, or ToI, Thing of Internet.

To add a bit of information to my journal, I'm considering getting a
programmable Amazon Button which I plan to keep by my bed. Click once
in the morning when I wake up and it will fire off some code on AWS to
write a journal entry "I woke up."   Doublieclick at night and it will
write a journal entry like "zzzz"

pros:

* get experience playing with Lambda or some new AWS serverless tech
* keep track of my wake / sleep hours

cons:

* open a security hole in my journaling process

## RFC

I'm not tied to using an Amazon Button (wich apparently doesn't ship
to Japan anyway), and I wonder if there are some other downside(s) I'm
missing.

I saw a lot of requests for IFTTT to ping people when commits are made
to git, but I wonder if IFTTT can commit to git.  Hmm apparently not
https://ifttt.com/github

Hmm might be easiest to make a webpage with a toggle button on it that
kicks off a request that does whatever I want.
