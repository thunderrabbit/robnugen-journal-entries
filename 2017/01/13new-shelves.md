I should be receiving new shelves today, between 9am and noon.  Lin's
way more excited about them than I am, but I look forward to having
more space so I can more likely finish unpacking. (I started unpacking
in early June 2016.)

Once we got home after buying the shelves, I realized that these
shelves don't provide a place for my printer. dang.
