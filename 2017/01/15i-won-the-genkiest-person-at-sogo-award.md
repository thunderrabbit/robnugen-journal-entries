Great time at SOGO today, though I was surprised to find out that Mike
is moving back to the US!  Oh my gosh I had just enjoyed personalized
training with him last week!  His support of SOGO was celebrated with
the support of the group lofting him into the air.  Spontaneous chaos

For the last part of today's workout, Mike led us in some Mike style
exercises, which were way over my skillz, including lots of kickboxing
punches and kicks.  I danced for part of it, while Emi filmed the
group.

Then we had a 2-minute burpee challenge.  In the challenge, women were
allowed skip the pushup part, and everyone counted their own burpees.
I did 18 in two minutes.  A couple guys did 40+!!  Two of the women
did 50!  They had a 20 second burpee-off to see who would win the
prize of 2000 yen.

There was another 2000 yen prize to the person who brought the most
guests, and then I won 2000 yen for being "genkiest" since I workout
barefoot each time!  Super thanks to Oliver for nominating me.
