Via my repo to
[set up new Dreamhost shell account](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/new-DH-user-account/blob/master/README.md)

    [server]$ ./password_fix.sh
    This script will set your password to 432 random characters if you enter your current password now:
    
    Enter your password only if you are CERTAIN you can log in without password:
    Okay interactively changing password. Do NOT enter anything at the next password prompt:
    Changing password for user.
    (current) UNIX password: Enter new UNIX password: Retype new UNIX password: passwd: password updated successfully
    if password is reported as changed, then it's now 432 random characters but I didn't keep a copy.  tada!
    [server]$
