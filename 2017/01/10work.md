Right now I'm in a conveni across from GG class in Akihabara (formerly
Akibahara).  I've just walked here (in about 25 minutes) from the
imperial gardens, during which time I talked to Chuck from online
I-group.

Soon I'll teach GG's lunch lesson for whoever usually teaches it.
It's great because they are largely self-directed; we just talk about
the latest news or whatever they want to discuss.
