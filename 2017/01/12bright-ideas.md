I found a website that allowed custom orders for their products.  Like
a shopping cart, but with several dropdowns to specify attributes of
the product.  Hmm I wonder if we could make a custom form builder for
people who have customers with custom orders but no website skizzles.

That's been done, but I wonder if there's a market for it in
Japan(ese).

Oooh oooh what about custom greetings cards?

That's also been done.
