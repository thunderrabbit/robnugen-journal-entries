Go teach GG in Akiba

Go lunch with E in Ueno

Go to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned  (a first for me!)  I'm
curious if the difference will be noticeable.

At the GG lesson I learned a couple interesting things about Japanese
school system.

According to my students, there is a strict rule about how birthdates
correspond to what year of school a student is in.

For kindergarten, all students who were born between March 31st of
one year and March 30th of the next year will start kindergarten this
year.

For elementary school, all students who were born between April 2nd of
one year and April 1st of the next year will start school this year.

Wait what?  So students born on March 31st or April 1st have to wait
in limbo for a year????

Lunch with E featured pizza in Ueno!  She told lots of interesting
stories about the history of the world.

Got my teeth cleaned at dentist.  I can't really tell a difference in
color, but my tongue said they felt different.

I walked from Yurakucho to Hiroo in 1 hour.

I-group was great.  I'm looking forward to Head Heart and Soul on 31
January 2017.
