This morning I woke up on time to arrive near Zavas at 7:45am.  That
lesson was fine, and then I-group online was equally fine.

Went to lunch with Kai, and talked about our respective presentations
while eating at Kung Fu Panda (?) in the food court.

Had an extra hour before lesson at T, so I went to Unidy and got a
hook for my wallet chain, because my previous hook broke.  The guy at
the info desk spoke English more effectively than I would have
guessed.  He helped me find the perfect hook.

Then to T where I taught two lessons in the showroom.  Long time no
see Midori and not-so-long time no see Tomoko.

Then to lesson with GG and talked to Yoko for a bit afterward; she
seemed to like that I was wearing a suit today!

Woah falling asleep there.  はなしたくない.  Wow.
