Wow; I hope this script works!

I couldn't get it to work.

Travis replied to my plea and gave some more resources, which I hadn't
looked at before.

    Here is a current guide that covers your target OS:

    As for Redmine, I noticed that Docker has an official Remine repository:
    
    https://hub.docker.com/_/redmine/
    
    I see that it is based on Debian, but that is not too different from
    Ubuntu.  Perhaps the Dockerfiles might be helpful reference, and you
    can always execute a shell in a container and check out the install.

Got it.  I offered to hire a guy on upwork and he helped me get it
sorted even before I actually provably could pay him.
