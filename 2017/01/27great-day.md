Yeah so today was pretty great.  Started with an online meeting with
two men from Mankind Project in the US.  They answered some questions
I had about getting some funding to bring leaders here.  After that
meeting, they suggested I join another online meeting with men who
help support men's circles.  25+ men on the call; great connection and
I got some great resources, including support for doing Open Circles,
so we can advertise to the public and let new men see what it's all
about.

And I got a lot of work done on my marble track shelter.
