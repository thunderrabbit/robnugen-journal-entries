    TL;DR:  Would you like donuts delivered to your place on Monday morning Nov 20th?
    
    details: Story time!  Today I was inexplicably late for class which
    happens to be near your place.  I told them I would get donuts before
    class next week.  I found a donut place, checked Google Maps to see
    how to get to the class... and the track goes right by your house!
    
    I don't want to bother you guys on a work day, but I do want to come
    say HI with donuts if it's convenient for you!
    
    The class starts at 12:00 so I would have to leave at 11:30 at the latest.

Might end up meeting each week before class!
