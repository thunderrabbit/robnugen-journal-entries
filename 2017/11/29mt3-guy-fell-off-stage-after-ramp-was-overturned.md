I finally glued the last piece of the M Splitter.. and it works!
Marbles roll down it faster than I had hoped, so I considered lowering
it.. but there is *just* enough room for the small marbles to roll
*under* that track and onto the small marble track which has walls on
it, if I lower one of the walls.

Unfortunately, that wall is also the support for the track, so it will
be tricky to cut.  I might have to use the dremel or something..

Oh, so while installing the supports for the M Splitter, the
red-and-white headed character knocked over the ramp.  Then the
character who helped install the ramp fell off the stage where the
ramp had been.
