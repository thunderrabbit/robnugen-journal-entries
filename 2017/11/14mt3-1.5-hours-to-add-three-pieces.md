Funny to put it that way, but yeah today about 30 minutes per glued
piece, if I recall correctly.  I went to bed early last night and woke
up early to get started on MT3.

Right now I am on the train so don't have the clip ID handy..  oh but
Chrome remembered it.

I am optimistic that the pieces I glued in place will prove to have
been glued in correct enough places to stay put.  Oh, and I used the
dremel I got from Dad to clean up some pieces.  They look nice.
