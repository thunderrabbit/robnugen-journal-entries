A local train leaves my station at 6:15 or so.  It takes 45 minutes to
get to Shinjuku.  It seems to always have all of its seats taken, but
today I found a seat in the very last car.  Only downside is I barely
have room to get out my computer, and I am currently typing with one
hand. There is dfinitely not enough room to have my elbows at my sides
and type with good posture.

Ah here in Yoyogi-Uehara, most people got off the train and now I have
room on both sides for elbows.
