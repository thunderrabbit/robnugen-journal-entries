I have read up until Book 3 King Seem in _The Saint's Rise_.  I tried
to send my edits to Mike through my own Owncloud site at
own.robnugen.com but I forgot to send the download password at first,
and then the download password apparently didn't work.  So I attached
it as an email.

    Old school it is!
