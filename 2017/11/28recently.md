Recently,

* An elderly man fell as he was getting off the bus with an elderly
woman. Everyone on the bus exclaimed, but the bus driver took off
before anyone moved.
* I nearly completed the M Splitter on Marble Track 3.
* I tried getting Netlify CMS working, but still have a few bits
missing, starting with authentication.
* I failed an test at TY.  There will be other chances, but I felt sad
because I had thought I would do better.
* Eight men attended men's circle last Tuesday.  We may have even more
this coming Tuesday.
* I finished _The Saint's Rise_; Michael said my edits/comments were great help!
* Sleeping Bag, the first classical music event where attendees were
  invited to sleep during the performance, was a great success,
  despite having had limited time for advertising.
* I got an old copy of the new SB DB from Alfonzo.
* Jennie can now enter/exit PRN through her door.
