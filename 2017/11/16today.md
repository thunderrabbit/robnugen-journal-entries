Funny talking to Scotty on Marco Polo; he kept not being able to hear
me until I was like "okay bye" or "okay I hope you could hear it that
time!"

I am headed to Kawasaki to support the guides in the English versions
of their work.  Then GG lesson in Akihabara.

Quick online I-group today; everyone checked out so it was just me and
my coach near North Zulch, Texas.
