I woke up at 4am with no alarm, and then actually got up at 4:26.
Chatted with Jason and Jimmy for a second before getting to work.

Work included getting Ansible to create directories for a SB website on
AWS.  Basically I am tweaking the playbooks and roles from AB website
to work on SB website.  I need to make them a bit more generalized,
but to a degreee, I think they are pretty good.  There is a bit of
non-3rd Normal stuff (the expected deploy script is named after the
website) but I think that is reasonable.  Oh, maybe I can make the
name deploy_backend.sh in the role, and then change it to
deploy_sitename_backend.sh on the server.

Okay I am going to snooze a bit on the train.  Oh, today I am subbing
for Matthew near Zavas.  Yesterday may have been Chika's last day in
class.  I bought Country Ma'am strawberry cookies for her.
