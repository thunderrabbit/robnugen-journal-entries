I just downloaded Firefox 57 and was surprised with an insecure form
detected by Lastpass when I tried to log in to Pocket with Firefox.  I
wonder if it's an OAuth issue (cross site security)..

When I tried to take a screenshot of it, I discovered Firefox 57
cannot take screenshots while modal dialogs are up.
