As usual, my phone battery is low after not having charged it today.
I charged it at JB the past few weeks but forgot tonight.

My computer battery is charged, so I can read Michael John Grist's rewrite of Sen's
adventures in _The Saint's Rise_.

I am on page 170 or so out of 470 and had hoped to finish by 20
November.  hmm.
