## 13:01 Tuesday 21 November 2017 JST

I added about 2 seconds of footage today in 1.5 hours.  Fast because a
lot of it was just moving some characters around.  Slow because Jennie
came to sit in my lap for a bit.  (I have come to accept the idea of
letting her walk onto the scene; I will just take pictures of her
entry...  but she chose not to walk on the desk.)

Anyway, I am about to add a difficult bit to the large track, which
will kinda set the stage, so to speak, for one of the small tracks,
which runs nearby, and a medium sized track, which will branch off
from the large track (by falling through the track.  (That's the
tricky bit.))
