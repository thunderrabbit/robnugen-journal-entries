Hung out with Kai and Mika near Mika's work tonight.  They gave me a
stack of flyers to hand out for a show that Mika and Kai will be
staffing on Monday.  Thanks to Mika for sending my medium rare burger
back to be recooked to well done as I had ordered!  Thanks to Mama for
snacks she brought back today from her trip.

Mika had to head back to work so Kai and I walked her there and then
walked to Tokyo station by way of her English speaking dentist.  We
met a man in the station who is apparently an 江戸子(sp), and talked
about how his ggggrandfather was a samurai.

Kai and I took the second oldest subway in Tokyo to the busiest train
station in Japan (the world?) and I jumped into a picture with some
guys who were posing next to a sign featuring Snoopy and large text
"Pose here" or something.  Then the timing worked out that Lin arrived
just after me so we took the same train back to our station!
