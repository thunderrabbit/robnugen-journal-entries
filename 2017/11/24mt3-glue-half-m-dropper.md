Today I glued the first half of the track which will separate the
medium sized marbles from the large marbles.  I am reasonably sure I
can get it to work without too much undo/redo, but it has taken some
time to get it to look like the characters put it all in place.

One slight mistake: I need to cut the end of the sticks because they
*stick* out beyond the edge of the circle.  I guess that is not bad in
itself, but for now I want to keep from doing that.

I will likely have to break, trim, and reglue the piece, but it should
not be too difficult once I put both of its supports down.
