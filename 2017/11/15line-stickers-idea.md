Haha someone had a good idea for LINE stickers.  I connected with
Midori and Tomoko on LINE and Tomoko sent me a sticker with her name
on it.  Like ハーイ　ともこだよ, where the fontsize for Tomoko was a
bit larger than the だよ.  Anyway, it's a whole set of stickers, and I
guess the artist did a whole bunch of names and pooped them all out at
little extra cost beyond writing the names.  Or mmmaybe he drew all
new images for the different names.
