Mutsumi introduced a new style lesson format where the guides sit down
together with me instead of just having individual lessons.  Hopefully
this will help them improve listening skills by listening to other
people have conversations in English.

I showed mt3s.robnugen.com to Miyako and Ayaka.  Miyako showed me pics
from her trip to the US with Haruka.
