    22:51 sb: What do u think is best?
    22:51 me: It is best if you decide
    22:51 me: The items I mentioned above I think are perfect
    22:52 me: They make sense to me, and I think they will make
	          sense to anyone who uses them.
    22:52 me: I am worried that there may be some confusion about what
              you think is best.
	22:53 me: I thought we had agreed at the cafe about which domain
			  would be used for what purpose.
    22:53 me: I only brought it up tonight because I cannot easily set the DNS.

We got it sorted in the end.  Same decision as in the cafe.
