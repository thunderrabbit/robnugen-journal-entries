Okay it's been a couple days, but we had a lovely weekend in Shimoda.
So glad that Lin joined us!  She said she had a great time.  The
weekend schedule was kinda freestyle, which caused a bit of
consternation for some, but did not affect things too badly.  I
enjoyed getting to know everyone a bit better.

Yoga on Saturday morning was originally led by Lisa, but turned into
acro yoga with people being angels, superman, partners, flippers,
etc.
