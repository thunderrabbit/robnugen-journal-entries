Godot Engine would display its windows at the wrong zoom level so I
couldn't even use it... so I was like bah at first, but so many people
kept liking it, so I kept at it and discovered it was an issue with
different monitor pixel densities.  Aha!  Looks like Godot is reading
the pixel density on my main monitor even though it is open on a
second monitor.

If I move it between monitors, it resets and figures it out.
