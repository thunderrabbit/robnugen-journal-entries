Only one hour so far today on Marble Track 3.

The images above show the track before and after having glued the
second support on the first half of what I am calling the M Dropper or
M Splitter.  It will split the medium sized marbles off the large
marble track by being too wide for the medium sized marbles to touch
both sides of the track.

35 more minutes during this break to let the glue dry, and then I will
hopefully get the second half of this track glued today and have the M
Dropper working yay!

Well I haven't yet glued the second half, but I did get to the point
where I need to clip the first half, so I just bought some clippers
(whereas I had hoped to buy a saw blade for my drill).

The new clippers are pretty great!

Now three of four points are glued on the M dropper.
