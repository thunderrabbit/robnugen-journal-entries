Today I learned from C-san that the southern face of Mt Fuji erupted
in 1707, leaving a still clearly visible crater on the side of the
mountain.  So interesting!!

A-san showed us a satellite map which shows the hole and a
river-looking thing on another face of the mountain.

I'm glad C-san remembered her homework!
