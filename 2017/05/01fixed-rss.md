## 23:29 Monday 01 May 2017 JST

The developers of Hugo, without consulting me, changed the rssLimit
default from
[15 to unlimited](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/commit/fe41bd61bb21fa17a7e80ac8ee804fe010193e7e)
because it's the
[least surprising](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/3145#issuecomment-285535038).
That seems weird to me, so I changed it to 70 because that is
apparently the smallest Weird number.

173 was my next choice because 173 x 173 = 29929.
