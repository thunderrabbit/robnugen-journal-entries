While trying to fix the backup process, I destroyed the database by
overwriting with data from April 20th.

Had a good cry, and now am restoring the data from a 1GB backup file.

(It's this file that I guessed would be troublesome in a restore
process, so I wanted to break it up into bits.  Now we get to do the
restore starting with this file.)

Thank goodness it's Golden Week.

I contacted AWS support at 11:02am, and now at 11:40 the restore is in
progress.  Thank goodness for DS's calm and understanding
demeanor.... (plus understanding of the system!) to help me get going
quickly.

Finished, and confirmed.
