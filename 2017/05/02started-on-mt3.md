And by started, I mean I mostly cleaned my desk, found a reasonable
way to hold my camera, found
[Open Broadcaster Software, free streaming software that works on OS X](https://obsproject.com/),
andddd made a [crappy livestream](https://youtu.be/3Iyx0IiKxrI).

Now I am headed out to buy a couple of helpful items.

* ~~glue~~
* ~~wall~~
* ~~hooks~~
* ~~bearings~~  (yay!)
