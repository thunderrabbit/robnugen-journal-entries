Today I discovered the image server had run out of space; I hadn't
created a separate volume for its cache.  Got that sorted, but now
need to add a cronjob to prune the space.  I hope wiping files older
than N days should do it, because that what I plan to do.

But why tf are some images still showing up all FFFFFF white?  Well
that is just on the app.. I cannot figure out where the FFFFFF images
have been cached.
