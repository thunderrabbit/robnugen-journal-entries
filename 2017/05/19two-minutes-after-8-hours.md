I am the butt of the
[joke about knowing what to do](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=invoice+knowing+which+joke)
..  I just spent about 8 hours of trying to figure out why CB app was
not showing images.  Image server was okay, cloudfront was okay,
.. was it the app caching things?  I had to dig into the source of the app to
discover there is a differently spelled version of CB's domain name,
call it seebee, which was being used.  So pointing that oddly spelled
domain to the right place fixed the problem.

bah
