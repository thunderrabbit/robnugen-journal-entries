SOGO had their 1 year anniversary party on Saturday night at Womb.  It
was my first time to go to that club and I was worried it would be all
smokey and gross, but perhaps because it was a private party and SOGO
peeps are ostensibly into health and fitness, no one smoked; yay!

Everyone commented that I was wearing shoes for once, but I kicked
them off as the music started bumping after some fun team-bonding SOGO
style exercise activities.  Who can do 25 pushups the fastest?  Who
can do the most pushups in 30 seconds (with a cup balancing on lower
back).

Anyway, great time dancing with Nav, Mike, Rikke (sp), Gurleen (sp)
(who made great eye contact) and the party ended too soon for me to be
tired (3.5 hours) so I encourged Mike and co-workers to walk to
Roppongi.  Only 45 minutes, but the co-workers went barefoot!!  Wow!
We played The Jackie Purdy Game for a bit, and Mike presented some
logic puzzles about prisoners in hats.  I got the first one pretty
quickly

but took a bit longer for the second.

And Gurlene (sp) suggested there is an even *easier* way to solve it!

So great to meet you and I'm looking forward to frisbee next time!
