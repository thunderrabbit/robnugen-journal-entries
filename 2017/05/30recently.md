Been wonderfully busy with Marble Track 3.  Bought a new camera which
I plan to use for stop action photos, but before setting it up, I
needed to make an extension to my desk so the camera would be far
enough away to take photos properly.

I made three towers made of three sticks each, each stick made of two
pairs of bamboo chopsticks, unsplit.

It took 1.7 hours to get through the process of uploading those images
(mostly because I wanted to rename them based on the photo date).  Now
my computer is saying too many open files so Hugo cannot create the
site.  Bah.

I put CBs new FS server up a couple weeks ago, and today I finished
creating their front and backend servers on Ubuntu 14.  Still just
staging for now so they can decide.

Weird thing: they are going to revamp the entire site and I'll
apparently no longer be working for them on June 14th.  BUT I sorta
kinda doubt they will actually be ready by then.  Anyway, we will see.

I screwed together two shelves to make one shelf on which to put the
pyramids on which to put another shelf, on which to put my camera on a
gorilla grip tripod.  It is all wobbly, but once I get the placement
confirmed, I will tighten it up.
