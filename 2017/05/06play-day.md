Today I am going to Yurakucho to see Mika and Kai at an outdoor music
festival.  Kai will attend a concert that starts in 25 minutes.

I am probably planning too long of a day, but after the festival, I
plan to go to Womb for a SOGO event.  Only crummy thing is I have to
wear shoes to the SOGO event.  Not sure if it's a Womb rule or a SOGO
rule.
