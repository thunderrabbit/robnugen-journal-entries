Still working on a name for the circle which I had been calling the
co-gender group.  Anyway, our second meeting was great last night.
Five members in attendance, and we practiced exercises from Week 2 of
A Circle of Men.  After the circle, some members expressed interest in
exploring this further, so I guided them through clearing charges,
with the remaining member holding space.
