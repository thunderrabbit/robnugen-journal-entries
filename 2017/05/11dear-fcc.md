    Dear FCC,
    
    The FCC should stand up for Internet users by safeguarding net neutrality. 
    
    The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to hand the ISP
    monopolies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T the authority to create
    Internet fast lanes, stripping consumers of the necessary privacy and
    access protections we demanded and so recently won.
    
    I’m concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain
    types of data or websites because I would like my small business to
    have a fair chance of success.
    
    Thankfully, the existing Open Internet rules ensure that ISPs can’t
    slow or block consumers’ ability to see certain web services or engage
    in data discrimination by charging websites and online service money
    to reach consumers faster.
    
    That’s exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a
    level playing field that benefits small businesses and consumers as
    well as larger players. Chairman Pai’s proposed repeal of the rules
    would transform Internet providers into Internet gatekeepers with the
    ability to veto new expression and innovation. That’s not how the
    Internet was built, and that is not what we want.
    
    The internet should continue to be a place where free speech can
    remain free and where people can freely choose what content to
    consume.  Each individual website owner can choose their own policy
    regarding who can read their content.
    
    However, Chairman Pai's proposal would allow ISPs and wealthy sites to
    determine whose content can be read.  This will strength monopoly and
    not just discourage, but undermine the creation of new sites.
    
    Thanks for protecting Internet users like me by upholding the existing
    Title II net neutrality rules.

And another thing!

    It's not just websites that are at risk, it's pure innovation that
    is at risk.  When the MPAA tried to block VCRs from production,
    they were stifling their own future money-making ability.

    There are future technologies about which we cannot even dream.
    Please allow them to come to life and trust the future generations
    will thank us for ensuring the bounty of creative expression is
    guaranteed by law and cultural values.

    I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard
    Internet users like me.
