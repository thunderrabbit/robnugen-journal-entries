Man my productivity has been dismal for a while.  Basically it's cause
I have too much shit going on and can't keep the status of all my
projects in mind.

Specifically, I wasted an hour wondering why one particular image
would not show up, and turns out I had not yet updated my dev
environment to use the new image server.

Then a tiny bit of maintenance success getting my dev environment
fully working, but now it's time to go to my next lesson.
