Tonight I talked about Marble Track 3 during the lesson with GG.  The
next streaming video I do will be for them because 6 minutes before
the lesson started, I realized I had purchased the wrong type of
extension cable (the clerk tried to tell me but I did not understand
what she said.  180 yen wasted and a new wire to get stuck in some
fish's gill because the shop does not accept returns. bah), and Mayumi
encouraged me to go get it sorted.  Had to moe joe with two people
because I did not know the word for female connection is the same in
Japanese. bah.

Anyway, thanks to them, I now have an extension.  Labeled as a meter
long, but really only like 90cm.  bah.

oh!  I am wrong.  It is exactly a meter long within the tolerences I
can measure with Lin's tape measure.
