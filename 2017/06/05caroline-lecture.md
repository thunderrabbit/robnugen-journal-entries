## last night

(written 07:39 Monday 05 June 2017 JST)

Two weeks ago, I chose the location for Caroline's presentation
yesterday.  The setting worked out quite well, for those people who
were able to find it.  Seems that a couple people were lost in the
park.

Lin came to the lecture as well.  yay!  I'm glad she really enjoyed
it, and could witness some of the reactions people had (crying) when
meeting/greeting Caroline.

I met Michael for the first time that night, and Jorge for the second
time.  I saw Cozmo in the audience for a bit, but he left before I
said HI to him.

Michael and I chatted for a bit, and he seemed to understand the value
of men's groups, saying that he has been in some.  He may join Tokyo
men's circle.  Jorge may join as well.  Today I want to send them some
info on the group.

Jorge, Michael, Rohini, Lin, Miho, Lisa, and I walked Caroline to her
station where she and Michael left our group.  The rest of us walked
to a restaurant, but Jorge headed home once we found a place.  Rohini,
Miho, Lisa, Lin, and I ate a burger place where they had sample cup
sizes with fake ice.

I tolk Miho and Lisa about the co-gender authenticity circle and they
seemed interested in attending.
