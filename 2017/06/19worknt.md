Aint shit to do for CB now.

Unless they have something I don't know about.

I am on the train now in Shinjuku.  How is it they have more
super-express trains that express trains?  I guess they know what they
are doing and it works out for me, so there's my answer.

Anyway, I texted CB 44 minutes after our normal meeting time.

    [6/19/17, 1:44:12 PM] me: Do you want to have a meeting today?
    [6/19/17, 2:25:36 PM] CB: I am so sorry, we don't really have any task right now.
    [6/19/17, 2:26:09 PM] CB: I should've told you early.
    [6/19/17, 2:33:56 PM] me: Okay no problem.
    [6/19/17, 2:34:27 PM] me: Let me know if you have any questions during the week
    [6/19/17, 2:34:53 PM] CB: Ok, thank you!
    [6/19/17, 2:36:34 PM] me: I am going to work from home then, so Skype me if you need anything.
    [6/19/17, 2:36:40 PM] me: have a great week!
    [6/19/17, 2:37:02 PM] CB: Thanks!
