I have not yet seen Kai's great presentation, but I have been assured
it was great!  Soness coached her, so I know she received
compassionate knowledgable wisdom from a speaking pro!

I arrived just as the last speaker finished; I found the room because
I heard the applause from outside the door.

Lukas invited me in for the final picture, so we stood together in the
back.  He actually knew me from having been on TV earlier this year!

I also met his friend Rikako, who asked me about being barefoot, and
we thereby me Kiyoka and Daniel, who said they were eavesdropping on
our conversation.  I told them the whole story about being barefoot in
Houston and then being shod here before realizing no one would mind if
I were to be barefoot here.  I talked about my Pecha Kucha
presentation from last year (and got confused on the dates, thinking
my TV appearance was this February, but it was actually *last*
February (or so).  Anyway, they seemed interested so I told them about
and invited them to men's circle and co-gender circle respectively.

Rikako and Lukas are hosting a gathering this Saturday (near me and
Lin's house!) so I will join them there.

I gave a testimonial for Soness's coaching; I can still remember the
experience of preparing and presenting for Pecha Kucha as if it were a
recent event.  Kai did a testimonial as well; we could see she was
carrying herself with more confidence than before.  Apparently her
co-workers have recognized this as well.  So proud of her!
