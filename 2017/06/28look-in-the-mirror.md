I have often bitched about my wife not being able to speak English well,

but I just found some of her old emails, and I must admit she is getting better.

This is from 2011

    are u be in shibuya after art something?
    i just about to leave so i was wondering,
    let me know!

I hope my new awareness will help me stop bitching as much.
