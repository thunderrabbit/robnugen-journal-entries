Super great to find out there's neat park so close to our house!  I
had no idea how big it was, but there is a pavilion, museum, cool
sculpture, frisbee field, and more inside the park.

Met Kai in the station and chowed at Ootoya, because we were hungry
and not sure when everyone else was going to meet.  Shoulda asked
because first thing we did in the park was lay out a big spread of
food on blue tarp and chow.  I brought my camping chair which they
called the dad chair.
