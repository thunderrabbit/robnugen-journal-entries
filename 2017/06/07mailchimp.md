I would like to send an email reminder every 1st and 3rd Tuesday.
Doesn't look like it's possible with basic Mailchimp interface.  I
might be able to use their API to do it.

Ah nice.  They can do monthly campaigns, so I can just set up two
campaigns.  Their help support team sent me screenshots and great
detail on how to set it up.  Nice work, Mailchimp!
