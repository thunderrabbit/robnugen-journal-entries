Just finished teaching and am now seated on a balcony walkway thing
overlooking the empty water fountain in middle of Solid Square.

The lesson featured drills on two different patterns.  One student was like "I went
to shopping" so we practiced variants of that pattern.  Another
student arrived and started talking about TV so we practiced a pattern
like

______ is a _______ about _______ _____-ing ______ ____ __  _ _  _ _


and eventually made a game:

    This is a TV show about young adults living together in Hawaii.

Chika got it immediately: "Terrace House"

After 3 rounds, Chika ended up with 3 points vs everyone else having 0
points.
