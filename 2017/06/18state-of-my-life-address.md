1. I completed 40 frames of animation yesterday with new camera and
   trial version of DragonFrame.  I think I will buy a license for
   it.  One big question at this point is how to handle N*10^6 images
   in the final project.
2. I am currently headed to SOGO (Suns Out Guns Out) an exercise group
   I joined late last year, like in September I guess.  I only go on
   Sundays, but there are other activities people do every day of the
   week.  I am most interested in rock climbing, but I teach Sarumama
   on Mondays when the rock climbing group meets.
3. I started messing around with Mailchimp again to set up reminders
   before meetings, but have not completed it yet.. They do not have a
   way to send out mails every 1st and 3rd Tuesday, which is what I
   want.  I got messages to send via their API, but have not connected
   it to cron yet on my server.  So close; why did I not finish?  I am
   an expert at not finishing projects.
4. I plan to meet Tariq today after SOGO.  We want to upgrade our iOS
   apps to latest and "greatest" version of iOS and XCode, the
   steaming pile of okay well I have not used XCode 9 yet, but I
   assume it will be just as annoying as always.
5. Interesting to think about how I like to take pictures of
   construction over time, I am doing a stop action animation project,
   and I am planning to write (in reverse) a
   <del>book</del><ins>story</ins> within commit messages of these
   journal entries.  This is the first time I have mentioned it in the
   content of my journal and not the commit messages.  All of these
   seem like stop motion animation to me. I must be fascinated with
   changes over time or something.
6. Lin wants to buy a new mattress and to clean my room.  Cleaning my
   room took priority over the mattress, so I am curious as to how
   much she really wants a new mattress.  It's my fucking room; forget
   about it.
7. We have been calling my mom every week. I should call Dad too.
   Shit it is fathers day this Sunday I think.  That is today here and
   tomorrow there.
8. The co-gender circle has had 3 meetings; we are going through
   Kauth's book _A Circle of Men_.  There may be some new men joining
   the men's circle soon.
9. I bought domain name mypowercircle.org and authenticcircles.org but
   have not done anything with them except redirect to
   https://tokyo. in each case.
10. Abbrevs because arrived and gotta get off train.
11. Just switched trains in Yoyogi Uehara to the Chiyoda Line, on
    which Helma used to live before she got kicked out of the
    country for overstaying her visa.  #srsbzns
12. We have one cat (Jennie), zero kids, zero other animals, a lot of
    plants, including a bit of a garden with herbs (Lin's hard work),
    a subscription to milk delivery (just like old times except with
    cartons instead of bottles) and occaional meal-ingredient
    delivery.
13. I have recently bought a new laptop cooler for my 5 yo Macbook.
14. 9:57am Just arrived in Meiji-Jingu-Mae/Harajuku so see ya after SOGO

15. I am downstairs in Wendes/First Kitchen in Shibuya, and Tariq will
    arrive soon.  There are outlets available.  I am super low on cash
    right now, but I had enough for a chicken burger, and I have
    enough to get back home.
