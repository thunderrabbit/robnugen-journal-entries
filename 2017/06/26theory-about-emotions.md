Back in high school I determed that emotions must be important.

Why do they stay available long after the cause is finished?  Not like
memories or scars which fade with time, but remain somehow somewhere,
available until we experience them.  I experienced this long after my
granddad died and smelled something that reminded me of him.  boom
crying crying tears even though I only vaguely remembered the thing he
gave me.

Like our bodies aparently refresh cells every 6 months or something to
keep them viable... is there some mechanism by which emotions are kept
viable?

Recently, I noticed another thing.  They (who?) say that we end up
marrying someone who was like our parents, possibly because we are
attracted to the same wounds we had as kids.  But why?

Maybe (and this is my theory) maybe we are driven toward people who
emotionally wound us in the same way so that we are given more chances
to heal the wounds.

If I need to deal with the sadness due to absent parents, I marry
someone who is emotionally unavailable..  so I have a chance to deal
with that sadness!  Isn't that convenient?  It makes me think
something like "emotions are self healing", but it's not
that... "emotions drive us toward behavior that triggers the emotions"

more to come ?
