Yesterday in my online men's group I used my time to look at why I get
so unreasonably pissed off when I have to repeat myself.

Guided via questions, it went something like this.

<p class="dream">Where do you feel this anger?</p>

    In my throat, like it is lodged in there.  A solid steel ball
    blocking everything.

<p class="dream">Does this solid steel ball have a temperature?</p>

    Cold. everything is cold, like in the middle of snow.

<p class="dream">Who is there with you?</p>

    I am alone.  They left without me.  Actually I got lost.  I didn't
	stay with the group and I got lost. <tears>

<p class="dream">Who found you?</p>

    No one. I died. <sobbing> I fucking got lost and I died. They
    told me to stay with the group but I did not listen and I died.

<p class="dream">Okay, what does this part of you need?</p>

    To be found.  To be loved.

<p class="dream">Okay, can you come back to your present self?</p>

    Yes.

<p class="dream">Can you offer him that love he needs?</p>

    Yes.

<p class="dream">Does he believe you?</p>

    Yes.  He sees that I came back for him, and he is now safe.

<p class="dream">What is his message for you?</p>

    The world is a wide and wonderous place.  There are so many neat
	things to see and he wants to show me.

<p class="dream">Can you do that with him?</p>

    Yes.

<p class="dream">What would that look like?</p>

    There is a park on a hill near our house and we can go up there
    together.  He can show me what he wants to show me.

<p class="dream">When will you do that?</p>

    I will go with him twice this week, before our next meeting.

<p class="dream">Are you complete?</p>

    Yes.

The very same day, I started to get scratchy throat.  My the time I
had a lesson 12 hours later, I was sore throated and feeling sick.
Slept all day yesterday and told Rohini via FB that I had an
interesting story to tell her.  Soon thereafter I was shivering
uncontrollably and got into bed with extra blanket.

Extra blanket was too hot after a while, and when I woke up around 2am
this morning, blood did not go to my brain and I passed out while on
the loo.  Appparently my eyes were open but like glazed over.  Lin was
saying "please come back" when I came back to consciousness.
