## Yesterday

(written 17:38 Sunday 11 June 2017 JST)

Yesterday Simon and I had a great time walking from Harajuku to Tokyo
Tower.

We caught a ride with Lin on her way to work, and saw an interesting
accident underneath 246.

He said Yoyogi park was great, and they have nothing like it in
Osaka. Near the front of the park, we saw some people doing a
religious ceremony near some trees. It was as if each person were
singing to his or her own tree, but they were all singing in like a
round with one guy kind of leading the charge.  He was wearing formal
religious attire whereas the rest of people were just wearing regular
street clothes.

We walked around the fountains after that, and then I remembered I
want to show him the "homeless" guys with blue tarps down on the west
side of the park. We walked that direction and I discovered a new
bridge out of the park which I hadn't seen before and a monolithic
statue or something that looks like a giant tomb with an 3rd Reich
style eagle on it, and Japanese text I have not yet gotten translated.

Once we got to the homeless guys, Simon was duly impressed with their
homes, especially the one guy who apparently does paintings in is his
home, which looks a lot like a greenhouse.

Got a nice picture of us at the fountains in Yoyogi, and then decided
to head toward Shibuya.  We walked across the old bridge, which was
new to me, and goes to a set of sports fields from a high school, I
think. We walked briefly pass the Vietnamese festival, and then headed
down the walkway next NHK, and turned right once we got into the back
streets of Shibuya.
