It is weird because I have only heard from Nate that today is my last
day with CB.  I got a message saying "let's hold off on the server
upgrade until July" ...  but I am done today, as far as I know.  It is
so weird to not be able to speak directly about stuff.

My contact had forgotten, but they know.
