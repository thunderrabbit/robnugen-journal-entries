Just finished going through the CB admin site and the CB staging site
to look for any differences.  I see some cases where functionality
does not work, but both sites produce the same results, even in those
non-working cases.

Right now they are in a meeting and I feel fear because I cannot
anticipate if they are going to be pissed because they think I did not
follow their unwritten expectations or if they will say yeah nothing
to do see you next week.

I am just idliing and it sucks.
