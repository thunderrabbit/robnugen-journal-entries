We are in a kinda weird place with CB.  They are moving to a new
server / dev team.  Fair enough.  I knew it would not last fo-eva but
as of now, I am updating their servers to new Ubuntu at the same time
they are planning to shut down these servers in favor of different
servers run by a different dev team.

In any case, I wish them the supa best and hope everything goes smoothly.
