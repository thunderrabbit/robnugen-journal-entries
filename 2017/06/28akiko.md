Wow so great to be back in touch with Akiko!

I met her in EV back back in the day, and lost touch after I quit
working there and got busy etc etc, but today in the middle of getting
to Inbox Zero (I am cleaned out back to 2012 I think), I wrote to her
and she wrote back!

AND she says she is interested in teaching me Japanese, which I
believe I am more interested now than I was then.

AND AND she lives close to us!
