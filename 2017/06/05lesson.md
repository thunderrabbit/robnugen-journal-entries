I survived the lesson pretty genkily; we had a discussion about what
it means to be Japanese, and of the original list from which we later
culled about 2/3rds of the items, we had

Japanese people

* believe they are Japanese
* grow up in Japanese school system
* like to wait in long lines
* watch NHK on New Year's day
* are proud of Mt Fuji

That last one intrigued me; I had not predicted it.
