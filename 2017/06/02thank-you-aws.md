wow. I just got (what feels like) a huge bonus from AWS.  I broke CBs
website and had to ask AWS to help resolve it.  But to ask them, I had
to pay for support.  But it's CBs account, so they charged *him* to
support my error.  And due to the way support is billed, AWS bills the
next month in advance, so AWS billed CB *twice*.

I explained to AWS that I had wanted to put the support cost on *my*
credit card, and asked if there was any way to do that.  He said "I
will do you one better; I will take care of the fee and leave support
on your account for the rest of this month."

wow wow wow so thankful.
