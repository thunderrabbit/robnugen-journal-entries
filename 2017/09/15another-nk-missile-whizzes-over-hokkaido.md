J: top Reddit post .. what do people say in Toyko when this happens?

me: "Yay we are on Reddit!"

J: glad nothing happened and ya'll are safe though, for real.. just
wondering what people say there to each other when close calls like
this happen

me: tbh, some people got notifications via cellphone..  but I don't
hear people talking about it.  Just like when an earthquake happens...
well it wasn't The Big One, so life goes on as normal.

J: geez

J: seems scary looking in from outside

me: I am helpless to do anything about it, so I choose not to worry
about it .  I mean we have food rations at home and water stocked up,
but there isn't much else to be done about it.
