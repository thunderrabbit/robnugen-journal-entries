    Hurricane Harvey was the first major hurricane to make landfall in
    the United States since Wilma in 2005, ending a record 12-year
    drought in which no hurricanes made landfall at such an intensity
    in the country. In a four-day period, many areas received more
    than 40 inches (1,000 mm) of rain as the system meandered over
    eastern Texas and adjacent waters, causing catastrophic
    flooding. With peak accumulations of 51.88 in (1,318 mm), Harvey
    is the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the contiguous United
    States. The resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of
    homes, displaced more than 30,000 people, and prompted more than
    17,000 rescues.

Looks like Irma is going to be much worse.
