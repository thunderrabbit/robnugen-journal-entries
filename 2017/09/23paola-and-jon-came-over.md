Today was the first time for Paola and Jon to come visit our house
since we moved last summer.  Lovely time including delicious salmon
quiche, indian graham crackers (my name), plum pie, and two different
salads.  Oh, and we played the ball game that I do not have a name for
yet, but which I got from the shop in Harajuku.  Everyone played and
enjoyed it!  Lin even suggested we put it up in the living room.  Wow!
