Will be heading to Osaka tomorrow at 5am.  Gonna hang out with Simon
for two days.  Boating, skating, and maybe recording a podcast.  My
skates are way too big to fit in my backpack, so I am taking a
suitcase to hold them and my helmet.  I never ended up getting wrist
guards so I will skate gently and not fall down.

I will take my computer and get some iOS programming done on the
train.  Oh snap I better download the latest XCode.

Oh it is still GM Seed (whatever that means), but I will download it
anyway, just in case.
