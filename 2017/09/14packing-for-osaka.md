## 22:52 Thursday 14 September 2017 JST

Will be heading to Osaka tomorrow at 5am.  Gonna hang out with Simon
for two days.  Boating, skating, and maybe recording a podcast.  My
skates are way too big to fit in my backpack, so I am taking a
suitcase to hold them and my helmet.  I never ended up getting wrist
guards so I will skate gently and not fall down.

I will take my computer and get some iOS programming done on the
train.  Oh snap I better download the latest XCode.

Oh it is still GM Seed (whatever that means), but I will download it
anyway, just in case.

Good grief it is slow to download.  And it's not just me.  egad I hate
developing for Apple.

10 hours remain, but I leave in 5.5 hours so I killed the download.

Erica is right, and I
will [wait for the final .dmg](http://ericasadun.com/2016/03/22/xcode-upgrades-lessons-learned/)
