Simon gave me a set of weights, including one which he found discarded
on a hiking trail.  We hiked up the trail, found the weight still
there, collected it and cleaned it up in his shower.

He wanted to give me dumbells, but after I asked what would be good
for my lower back, he suggested a T-bar kettlebell.
