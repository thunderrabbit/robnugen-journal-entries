It was a bit challenging to use the screwdriver and drillbit which are
pretty heavy compared to the pipe cleaners, but I was able to get the
first hole drilled, and I think I have a good system to drill the
other holes in *just* the right places.  I have glued the drillbit
holder (yellow and green pipe cleaner guy) to the top of the bearing in
such a way that he will hold the drillbit in the right spot for each
hole simply by rotating the bearing.

The orange and yellow character will get to drive the rotation, and
the he might turn the thing on full speed, just for a laugh (but I am
not sure if I'll have him do that).
