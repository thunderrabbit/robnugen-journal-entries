It isn't as smooth as I'd like, but the moment Francois kicks the
stage represents about 1 hour of time spent during which I attached
the upper stage to the lower stage.  Connecting the upper stage was
challenging enough for me, so it would have taken a silly amount of
time to create footage of the pipe cleaner guys doing it.

Here are today's livestreams:

1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpeHQqscrnA up to when I let the
   glue dry on the circle-drawer after adding a new piece to make it a
   drill guide

2. https://youtu.be/oRRCVZZBqQg during which I drill pilot holes in
   the top piece, screw it to the rotating plate and try to align it
   so Francois seems to kick it into place
