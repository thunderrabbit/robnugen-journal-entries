It isn't as smooth as I'd like, but the moment Francois kicks the
stage represents about 2 hours of time spent during which I attached
the upper stage to the lower stage.  It was challenging enough for me,
so it would have taken a silly amount of time to create footage of the
pipe cleaner guys doing it.
