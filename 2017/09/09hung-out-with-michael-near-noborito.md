First time to hang out with Michael one on one.  We ate at a cafe in
the station and then went barefoot out on a balcony where we talked to
a mom waiting for her kid to come back from school.  Michael chatted
with her a bit, introducing us.. I was kinda amazed because even
though my Japanese is better, I'm not as willing to break the ice with
people.

We went barefoot out to the river and came across some peeps playing
soccer so we joined them for a bit.  Had some good fun and ended up
with business cards to their restaurant in the area.

Helped a guy by the river who had gotten a fishhook caught in his
shoe.  We were not able to get it out (even though I could not find a
reverse hook on it; maybe it was much higher on the hook), but we cut
the fishing line to which it was attached.

Then played Follow The Leader for a bit, and Michael surprised me by
walking on a rail adjacent to the river.  Nice!  We will play again
sometime.

Talked about internet and stuff until after dark and then headed back
to the station.  His shoes were gone from where he had put them.  We
found a security guard who led us to them down in their office.
