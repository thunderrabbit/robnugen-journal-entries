I have taken to takin' the super express train to work on Monday
mornings.  I get a guaranteed seat for a 20 minute snooze instead of
guaranteed standing room only for 30 minutes.  Only problem is the
schedule: I end up arriving 45 minutes early.

However, I have never been late to this class, given that I attempt to
arrive at least 20 minutes early.  On occassion, the trains are late,
and I like to not be late if at all possible.
