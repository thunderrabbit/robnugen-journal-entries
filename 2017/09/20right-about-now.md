I am in famous coffee shop SB in Lazona and have just watched
[New Rockstars breakdown of Rick and Morty Season 3 episode 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZuJpnXEK08)
after compiling a list of 6 phone numbers of men I will call tomorrow
morning (tomorrow night for them) to confirm their planned
participation in a new set of 6 Virtual Integration Group calls I will
be semi-organizing starting in October.

Before that, I walked with Chika to the station on her way to work
after our lesson in Zavas building.
