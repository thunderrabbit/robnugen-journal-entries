Ugh.  I previously uploaded version 2.2.1 of an iOS app.  This time I
uploaded 2.2.3 and the reply was "Oh you already uploaded version
2.2.3"

Fine ffs so I boosted the version to 2.2.4 and uploaded it.

Now they say the version number must be higher than 2.21.

*I never uploaded 2.21*!!111  I uploaded 2.2.1.  WTF kinda checks are
they doing?  This is sofa king annoying.
