Tonight the co-gender group had its first meeting after our initial 8
meetings.  Two new people came and seemed keen enough that they will
attend again.  I did a process which helped people see the value of
emotional clearing work:

    Feeling: anger at my wife because she buys crap she won't use for long
    Anger source: helpless, feeling sadness that consumerism is polluting earth
    Feel sadness where: actually not in my body, like it's out in front of
       me, like I have lost touch with my groundedness
    How to regain groundedness: go climb a tree, reconnect with nature

So to recap, my anger at my wife is really hiding sadness about my own
disconnect from nature.
