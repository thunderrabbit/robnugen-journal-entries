Because I needed to get the bearing aligned, I did a little trope of
the scratching fingernails variety as one of the characters simply
pulled the bearing into place.  He was not one of the characters who
tried to wrangle it, but the sorta-joke is that apparently he could
have done it without all the trouble of making it float, etc.

I have spent [51+ hours](
