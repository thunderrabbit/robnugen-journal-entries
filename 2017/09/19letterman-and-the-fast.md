Yeah so I ate too much yesterday and planned to fast today.  But
Letterman appeared and ripped the E from his sweater and Tariq took me
to brunch after our lesson.  I walked too close to my next lesson and
was spotted so now I am at B where I will teach at 2pm, about to chow
their scrumptious lunch. Oh, and all of this was after I discovered
the lunch delivery was not cancelled yesterday for the holiday.
Yesterday's lunch was still waiting this morning.
