NA is the two letter designation for a new lesson I will be teaching
on Mondays.  It is within walking distance of the Monday morning
lesson, but there is a bit of a gap in between so I am chilling at a
restaurant in Tokyo Tower.

Lesson was tough at first when I tried terribly to explain my
intention to the group of quietly patient students.  Man oh man they
had a bilingual woman last time; how I wished she had been in
attendance!

Got it sorted out after I started doing role plays, in which,
fortunately, I was able to incorporate some of the words we had gone
over before.  Yay for winging it!
