While I was walking out of Ueno station, a tall man and I did the
foreigner nod and then he said he had seen me on TV (for being
barefoot).  We shook hands and talked for a bit about the importance
of doing one's own thing.

He said, "I respect you," and I should have said if he sees
respectability in me, that means it's in him, too.

I gotta stop and chat a bit longer to people who say HI like that, but
I dunno what to say.  Maybe I will ask if they live in Tokyo.
