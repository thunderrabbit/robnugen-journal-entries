OMG my Japanese teacher has recently been told she has to have
something removed from her throat!

    Thank you for your kindness. I think I'll be OK. But to be honest
    they'll cut my throat and take something off (sorry!) so I have no
    idea how long is going to be until I can speak as a language
    tutor. Hope it's soon though. また　たくさん　話しましょうね！

Yikes stripes!!

I told her I would be happy to take lessons where she just types and
doesn't have to talk.
