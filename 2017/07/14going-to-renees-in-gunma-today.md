Such a nice area!  We went to a long cave thing that was apparently
dug without modern equipment.  It is 400 meters long, and was
apparently supposed to go 400 meters more, but life and heavy rock got
in the way.  Really nice quiet energy there.

Visited a 41.8 meter tall statue which is 10 meters taller than
Corcovado in Rio.  So interesting because my memory of Corcovado is
that it was taller.  Like way taller.  Is it an illusion? Faulty
memory?

We went to the daruma shrine after going to a daruma shop where they
had hundreds of different daruma in a wide variety of sizes and
colors, including some branded with sports teams logos.

Francois has been featured in many many photos.
