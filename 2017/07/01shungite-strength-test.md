Wow.  I had Lin hold her phone to her ear and hold out one arm.  I
pushed down on her arm and asked her to resist the push.  I was able
to apply 20 newtons before her arm sank.

Then I *called* her phone and did the same test.  She was only able to
withstand like 15 newtons.

Then I had her hold shungite next to her phone and did the same test.
She was able to resist 20 newtons again.

She was like "wait wait wait do it again," so with the phone still on,
she put the shungite down and lost her arm strength again.

Put the shungite near the phone again and had her strength back.

I did *not* preface the experiment with any info.  Just did it and she
was like, woah, which was my same reaction which I had this morning
doing the strength test with Ren√©e.
