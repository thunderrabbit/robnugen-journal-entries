About once a week I eat lunch at Wired Cafe in Lazona.  I always order
the same thing (salad pizza, unsliced), sit in the same place (near an
electrical outlet), and joke around with the manager when he is in.

One time I busted out my Japanese and ordered five (5) cheesecake
sundaes.  チーズケーキいつつお願いします。 and he was like five??  And
I was like haha just joking.

But we carried the joke forward, and ever since then have been
counting up/down the cheesecakes that I order.  Today I ordered it
again, and have decided it is my fifth since we started counting.  So
I was like 五つのご番目のちーずけーきお願いします、 and he was like
???, which is fine because it's a weird request, but is that a
reasonable way to ask for the "fifth of five cheesecakes"?
