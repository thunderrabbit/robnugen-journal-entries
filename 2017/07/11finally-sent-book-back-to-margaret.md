I finally got Margaret's book on its way back to her.  She lent it to
me years ago.. like 8 years and said she would like to have it back
sometime..  and then our group ended and she left the country.

Funny that after I reached her and got her address yesterday, I
suddenly had the desire to read the book to my GG class.  I thought
they would get a kick out of it, but *actually*... I was hoping to get
a kick out of being such a good guy for sending the book back and
reading such an interesting book to the class.  Fuck that.  It's
Margaret's book and she apparently has a 7 year old waiting to have it
read.  Sent it today.
