Lesson at Zavas featured a high level discussion of two different
peering arrangements (p2p vs centralized) and the concept of
protocols.  I was planning to talk about Bitcoin, but the word "peer"
in the whitepaper started the discussion we ended up having.

I had a distinct sense of inadequacy when describing layers of
protocols that make up the internet, but that may be because when I
hear the phrase "the internet" in my mind, my mind replies with "the
internet is made of cats, the internet is made of cats, cats! cats!
cats!" before I can think of anything else.

Even so, I explained how centralized sites are targets for attack and
how they are "free" because they can sell our data.  I listed
bittorrent, tor, mumble, pgp, gpg as peer to peer protocols.  I guess
SMTP is one as well.  Not sure about Mumble, actually.
