Egad I am missing SOGO again (4 times in a row)

But it's nice to see Lisa and Miho!

Actually only Lisa is with us while Lin is driving, and they are all
blah blah blabbin chat chat chattin and missed a turn recommended by
GPS.  Twice.

Only 1 hour (4.9km) to go! <del>Yay!</del>

I could have fucking gone to SOGO and take the train down to meet Lin
and them. fack.

We arrived.  So hard for me to understand how driving is preferable to
Lin.

Okay okay the day turned out to be pretty good.  We had a nice time by
the ocean (not beach; it was all layers of volcanic rocks tilted at an
angle)

After we set up our tent and chairs, Lin found the same little pool
that we enjoyed 2(?) years ago.  I guided Miho there with the fewest
vertical changes, and then carried all our stuff to the spot.

Got into the water slowly; it was cold and wavy over sharp shells.
There is a still pool nearby where the water is a bit warm in the top
meter or so.  The warm pool had some anemones in it which I think may
have stung Lin, Miho, and Lisa.  I got poked by one so went out a
different direction.

We pet the cat at the ice cream shop with a cat and Lin did a cat
impression while I took slo mo video.  Not sure it is worth putting
online, but she seemed surprisingly not embarrassed by it, so she
might.

I climbed with Francois up a slightly steep hill next to the car and
then threw him down to get funny pictures.  Lin tried to throw him
back and he ended up in a place that required judicious use of the
parasol pole Lin bought for this trip.  Glad it came in helpful!
