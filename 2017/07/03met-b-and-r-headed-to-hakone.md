Met R and B (Rhythm and Blues?)  B and R (Banana Republic?) in
Shinjuku today.  I hope I helped them get to Hakone easily and quickly
enough.  We rode the fastest train that would stop at my station on
its way to Odawara.

They have been studying in Taiwan, and came to Japan to check things
out.  They've been to pretty much all the good spots on the metro map
of Tokyo.

B said an interesting thing that countries have had the right for
millenia to have standing armies to protect them.  Could be true, but
I wonder if it is necessary, and who benefits from having an army.

I invited them to read about
[WTC7](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=wtc7) since they had not
heard three towers fell in NYC that day.
