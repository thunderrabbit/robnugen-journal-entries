Tonight on the Tokyo Bay cruise (1200 yen with Yukata) I met Renée who
has recently started a business called
[MRS Gunma](https://www.mrsgunma.com/) in Gunma with her husband.
They have a romantic getaway house and an onsen nearby, plus they are
distributors for
[Shungite](https://www.mrsgunma.com/shungite-zero-spa) a stone which
arrived on earth via meteorite back in the day in Russia, I think.

For the record, I gave Renee 20,000 yen cash on the day I met her
because I was so inspired by her story.  She said she had wanted to
order some bags with her logo on them, so I gave the money as a pure
gift.  I chose not to write about it here because I hadn't given it to
get public kudos.

Now that she wants me to pay 21,000 more yen after I left a
[not-flattering review](/journal/2017/08/13/final-feedback-on-gunma-trip/)
on Airbnb, I figure I will write (more) of the back story.
