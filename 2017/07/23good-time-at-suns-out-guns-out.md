I missed SOGO 4 weeks in a row, and will miss it again next week, but
I enjoyed being back today!  Saw Kai while walking near Harajuku
station so got to say HI to her for a bit.  Super glad that she has
been enjoying the workout as well.  She met Tai while there, so they
enjoyed having rhyming names.
