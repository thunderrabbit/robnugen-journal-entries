## 20:50 Monday 31 July 2017 JST

1. Today was the first day to teach at a restaurant in Hiroo. 10
   students, most of whom are beginners, but all were able to get
   through some language, including, but not punctuated as, "how many
   in your party please follow me here you are here is the menu what
   would you like to drink please let me know when you are ready to
   order" and "this is sirloin sukiyaki may I help you prepare it we
   recommend rare but how would you like it cooked this is our
   original sauce dip the sirloin in egg wrap it around rice and
   enjoy"

2. Today was the second of five nights I substituted for Patrick at
   AK.  At first, Eiko told me about how job and drew some pictures of
   how plastic containers are made.  Then I reviewed the homework at
   Mifuyu's request and suggested an article which she tried to print,
   but wasn't able to, so I will print it and bring a copy next week.

3. Today is the first day back after the Gunma trip.  We have been
   talking about it on FB; there were quite a few problems, but the
   proprietor has been clear in how most of them were not her fault,
   so it is hard for me to give further feedback.

4. I plan to do it, though; probably via email.

5. Goodness I almsot just fell asleep.  (I plan to leave that
   misspelling of almost because it is indicative of my state.) I am
   currently on the train headed to our station from Noborito, but I
   was up at 5:10am or so and have not yet caught up on sleep after
   the weekend.

6. I just realized that next week is the mikoshi thing but I do not
   want to go.  I would rather join SOGO at the beach.  I need to RSVP
   for SOGO, so if I forget to do that, I will do the mikoshi thing in
   Kawasaki.  Gosh it would be a bummer to miss the beach.

7. Next station is my destination.

8. Today I missed my destination by two bus stops.  Then I went back
   but missed it again, not knowing that on the way back the bus stop
   names are not aligned across the street.

9. I have done 13 hours on Marble Track 3.  I plan to work on it
tomorrow.

10. I have not done enough work work recently (according to part of my
    brain) so I plan to work some on paid website work this Friday and
    Saturday.

11. Good to talk to Steve yesterday about IT stuff while he drove us
home (and dropped me off in Takasaki station)

12. Tomorrow night is the 1st or 3rd Tuesday of the month, so
    therefore men's group.  Oh, I made a website
    https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/ I think it should be mkptokyo or
    mkpjapan or tokyo.mkpjapan maybe.

13. We have one cat (Jennie) and no other pets or kids or anything.

14. I have not drawn any art for a long time.  I still own
    amazeaweek.net but have not touched it nor wiki.robnugen.com for
    quite a while.

15. Dealing with the aftermath of our Gunma trip may take a while, but
I am optimistic for getting it done by next week.

16. I walked from Tokyo Tower to Shibuya station today (with teaching
at the restaurant as a two hour pit stop in the middle)
