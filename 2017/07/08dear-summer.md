While preparing to post my question to /r/emacs, the power went off in
our house.  The circuit breaker flipped.  Lin's AC and my computer +
monitors are apparently on the same circuit, which seems weird, but I
*guess* it was not the neighborhood losing power.

Oh, so while my computer battery is still fine, I cannot post the post
while the router has no power.

Nevermind.  It is the whole house.  I am just going to leave it off to
save energy.
