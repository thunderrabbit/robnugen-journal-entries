While preparing to post my question to /r/emacs, the power went off in
our house.  The circuit breaker flipped.  Lin's AC and my computer +
monitors are apparently on the same circuit, which seems weird, but I
*guess* it was not the neighborhood losing power.

Oh, so while my computer battery is still fine, I cannot post the post
while the router has no power.

Nevermind.  It is the whole house.  I am just going to leave it off to
save energy.

The breakerbox has three types of breakers.  One type I have never
seen before looks like a normal lightswitch, but also features two
little buttons near it, red and white.  After leaving the power off
for a while the first time, Lin pushed the white button and flipped
the breaker back on.

Just a moment ago, when she turned her AC on the breaker flipped
again.  Now (after not waiting as long), when she pushed the white
button, the big breaker still won't stay on.

She is calling the company from which we bought the house, who offer 2
years of support, like a maintenance contract.

Warranty covers different stuff like foundation shifts (earthquakes?)
