On my way to Gunma today, I stopped by Joanna's to install a ceiling
fan which she had ordered.  She took me to a restaurant which served
everything on (round) tortillas with the sides folded to make them
square.

Great to see her again and hear about how things have been going!
Been a long time since The Artist's Way back in the day.
