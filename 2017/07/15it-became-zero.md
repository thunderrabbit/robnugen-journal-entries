Lin was all set to buy Shungite from Renee, but we ended up with not
enough time to do so after going to Haruka lake and shrine.  The lake
was fine and the shrine was nice, but because we were late leaving
because of this extra trip, neither Lin nor I really took the time to
enjoy it. I did get a couple of pics, but nothing like wow holy shit
this was worth being late.

Once we got back to our car and on our way home, we had 1.25 hours to
travel what is turning out to be 3 hours, or exactly the amount of
time Lin intended to use to get home.

Anyway, I am not interested in being the manager of tours or any
variant of a tour guide.  Gonna have to pass on this one.  Montana
moment and all that.

Turned out fine.  The AC guy said because they missed the problem the
first time, they would fix it for free, and we do not have to be there
to let them in because it's related to the outdoor unit.
