Worked at AK today for a 2 hour lesson.  Pretty great because the
students are all talkative and asked questions and such.  Chatted a
bit and then showed them an article I used with other class.  This
class had much higher comprehension of the article... which is good,
but shows me just how too-high the article was for my other class.

After the lesson, Eiko walked me back nearly to the security gate,
asking about PB a bit.
