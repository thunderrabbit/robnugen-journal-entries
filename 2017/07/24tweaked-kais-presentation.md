Met Kai today at 1pm to edit her presentation which she translated
from Japanese.  It was pretty decent actually, with just a few wonky
sentence structures and some punctuation typos.  It was so easy that
it did not take the 2 hours we had allocated, but boom done in an hour
sitting at ("Fresh like a box of _______ ______") down near Azalea.

So tired, can barely stay awake enough to make sure I don't zonk out
and miss the lesson which starts 1t 5:30pm.  I actually considered
getting a massage for an hour because then I could sleep and they
would wake me up after the hour, but that would cost more cash than I
have on me.
