This is the first time I have worked with glass.  Basically melted the
end of a glass rod and tacked some colors onto it after the sensei
wrapped it onto some sort of ceramic to which the glass apparently
won't adhere.

Lin took pictures during the process and then when I finished was like
お疲れ様です。 and I was like まだまだ and asked the sensei if I could
make another.  She was like, "of course" and Lin was like "bye".

For the second one, I asked if I could use two colors within one
bead.  She was like .... and I was like pleaseee and she agreed
頑張ります。  Yay!

When rolling it onto the ceramic stick, she did a few different
layers, so it will look kinda like a candy cane.  Yay!

Hmm I wonder if I should do one more with opaque glass and clear
glass.  Hmm I think I will.  But she is only here tonight so I have to
do it now.

Yayyyy

After a woman made her own bead, she and her, um, friend watched me
attempt my idea of clear glass surrounding blue glass with yellow
stripes in between both.

Sensei fixed it after I gooped it all up, but I hope it works out
nicely.
