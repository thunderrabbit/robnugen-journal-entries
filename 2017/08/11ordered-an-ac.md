Welp, I gave in.  But I like to think my computer gave in.  There have
been a couple of times this summer that I could not get work done
because my computer overheated and refuxed to turn on or do things
like accept keyboard / mouse input.

My room gets a bit hot, even with windows open,..  and I realized
recently, I have taken more naps because of my computer (and I)
overheating, so it has actually affected my income.

Oh Fraggle, fine I will get an AC.  I am sorry, Earth.  I hope we can
still be friends.
