Lin and Ma joined me on the way to SOGO.  They watched from a bench
across from the tree where SOGO peeps generally meet.  Workout was
great fun, though a bit hard since I haven't attended in a while.
Unfortunately I won't be able to attend for two months starting in
October.  I'm bummed about that, but work is work.
