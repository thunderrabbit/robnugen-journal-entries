    FEEDBACK from Co-coordinator no. 1 (as responsible for finding,
    promoting to & bringing 18 people)

    BABY-SITTING SHOULD NOT BE GUESTS RESPONSIBILITY and when asked to
    give the guest a break from their child, it should be heeded (it
    was not).

    GUESTS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO COOK, CLEAN or SERVE, especially not
    when paying 13,000¥ for the weekend.

    PRICE/ VALUE: 13,000 ¥ would be appropriate if guests had their
    OWN ROOMS (and could have done what was proposed).  Not
    appropriate for dorm-style sleeping.

    SERVICES: The cost of the weekend was also too high in proportion
    to the services provided.  What made it that price to the group
    were the activities we arranged and provided ourselves (yoga,
    games, meditation, & music...)

    CHANGE OF SCHEDULE: Dr. Wada’s treatments had been scheduled for
    2-5 p.m., but without asking co-organizers or the group, these
    went on until past midnight.  We could not do what had been
    proposed that afternoon, (ie. making Kokeshi / daruma).

    SUNDAY BREAKFAST FINISHED in AFTERNOON, -- Renee started late and
    chose to cook waffles, by herself.  Hungry guests jumped in, in
    hopes to be fed sooner.  Several people were still hungry
    afterwards, including helpers.

    DELAY meant we could not do any of the Lake Haruna activities that
    had been promised/proposed on Sunday.

    GUESTS NEEDS WERE NOT READILY ANSWERED—Some guests felt shut down
    and disrespected when they had Qs (ie. about breakfast, or packing
    up).  In a highly service-oriented country such as Japan, RESPECT
    is an essential element.  It was lacking.

    SHUNGITE OR NATURE EXCURSIONS: Not both.  Those who came to be out
    in nature felt a bit short-changed.  Trying to do both shungite
    AND excursions were not practical.

    NO RECEIPT & OVERCHARGED.  RENEE renigged on her offer to provide
    organizers with a free room, without informing in advance.  It was
    discovered upon returning home that we had also been charged, even
    though the 2 co-organizers had been promised.  And there was one
    guest charged 2 nights instead of one, that Renee had not noticed.
    That part she agreed to reimburse, but not the co-organizers stay.
    She apparently changed her mind when we asked for a group discount
    (but had not informed co-organizer 1).

    RENEE HAD WANTED GROUPS and asked for the business.  We had wanted
    to help.  But even with 18 people, not one person was discounted.

    Conclusion: co-coordinator no. 1 would NOT recommend this host,
    ESPECIALLY not for groups.

    Even though we guests thoroughly enjoyed each others' company, and
    we enjoyed nature when we DID get out, and the activities we DID
    get to do,

    this experience left co-coordinator no. 1 feeling disrespected,
    shut down and frustrated she could not provide her guests what had
    been promised.
