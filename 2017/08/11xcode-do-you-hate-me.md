Oh XCode, you're so quirky.

You automatically change Images.xcassets, automatically `add` the
changes to git, AND automatically restore the changes after I revert
them.  This might be helpful if you did not *also* refuse to build the
app due to missing images.  I hate building iOS apps.  Utterly shit
experience all the fucking time.

Why do sandboxed users have to have difficult passwords?  I don't mind
good passwords for real users, but not for sandboxed users.  AND keep
your password requirements written near where we make the users.  I
had to look that shit up on Stack Overflow.  OH, so not only must it
be 8 characters, have numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, we
cannot have consecutive letters, cannot have common passwords, and
something else?  Screw you and your password requirements for
sandboxed users Apple!   Why not do something like support your devs
by making a ChuckNorris password that we can all just use?

test@apple.com with password SteveJobs (or if we have to fit your lame
requirements Stev3Jobs) AND THEN JUST LOG IN!!   Use the Device ID to
distinguish who is whom.  Or even simpler, drop the requirements for
strong passwords for sandbox users!

Now that I got logged in, I get "Transaction error: Cannot connect to iTunes Store"
