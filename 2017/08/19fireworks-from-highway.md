89975 / 8272.8 Fireworks just started over yonder near the highway.

According to
[Underneath It All (NIN podcast)](http://shoutengine.com/UnderneathItAllANineInchNailsPodcast/)
I should listen to the
[Phoenix 1991 Lollapalooza Nine Inch Nails](http://www.theninhotline.net/news/permalink/1280893981)
show where something melted and killed their audio so they just
destroyed equipment.
