Hung out with Lisa and Jorge in Yoyogi park tonight.  Had invited some
other people, but they weren't available for various reasons.

Lisa arrived first and she and I chatted until Jorge arrived.  Kinda
like a life-sized ouija board, we found a perfect spot in the grass
beyond the lakes.  Sat and chatted for four hours!  Such a nice
evening getting to know them better.
