4. Lin, Ma, and I just got home from Nagano
5. it's raining harder than it does during the misnamed/mistimed "rainy
   season" of the past couple of years.
6. I recently created https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/ to be the MKP website for Tokyo / Japan.
7. Takeshi has talked about starting a Japanese-language men's group (on Saturdays)
8. I need to sort out different languages for the site (currently compiled by Hugo)
26. mypowercircle.org is currently only in English.  I do not know what Japanese content I can add while testing, but I think Takeshi will be the first to write Japanese for the site.
27. I will email him now.
9. Have recently re-started messing with XCode and trying to get our apps to work in latest iOS ~~garbage~~ version
10. Hugo keeps saying too many open files and the solutions here don't help https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/168
11. Yay I got it working with `hugo server --watch=false`
12. We have one cat (Jennie) and no other animals nor kids
13. We have lots of plants though. I basically just have Alex and his progeny
14. One of Alex's leaves seems to be taking root near the corner of the park at the top of the steps
15. The new Odakyu Line in Noborito had rails but recently *removed them again!!*
16. We talk to Ma about once a week
17. We talk to dad less frequently; he always seems to be busy
18. We may go see Lin's dad this year
19. I have the AB hard drive to try to get old data off the drive
20. I am sure the data does not exist, but gosh if it does that would be great
21. At this point, Marble Track 3 movie is in two parts, totaling like 1 minute 50 seconds https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2017/08/16/mt3-playlist-mt3-movie-so-far/
23. The playlist in the link above may get more / longer videos.
22. https://mt3.robnugen.com should show the latest video or news
24. I plan to work on MT3 a bit tomorrow.
25. Ma is leaving on Tuesday.  It has been such a quick visit!
28. I just emailed Takeshi and note that I am 25 messages behind inbox 0 (not counting 173 starred messages
