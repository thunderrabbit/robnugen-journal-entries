I have been taking (but not really posting) pictures of the new train
line in Noborito station.  I guess it's part of the campaign Odakyu
has been announcing that they will reduce the congestion on the line,
and even decrease the time required to go to Shinjuku.

Anyway, they did something which surprised me: put down the rails,
locked them down, then *took them back up* before laying them down
again.

The second time, the rails were pre-welded together, so that's
something, but ... why lay them down in the first place?  Could
someone have said "Oh snap! We forgot to weld them!" ???  I sincerely
doubt it.  Why would they put the rails down twice?  To make sure they
have enough?  To make sure they fit?  Seems like an expensive process;
rails are heavy!
