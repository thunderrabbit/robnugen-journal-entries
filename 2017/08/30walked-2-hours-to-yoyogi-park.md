I walked for 2 hours from NB lesson to Yoyogi Park.  I had 2 hours
total and Google said it would take 1 hour and 45 minutes.  I stopped
once to get a snack and a drink (and to change from pants to shorts)
and then stopped again to buy a 2 liter bottle of tea.  Made it to
Yoyogi Park with 2 minutes to spare.
