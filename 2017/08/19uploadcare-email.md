I am using my phone to give my PC access to the web, but it isn't
working, so I'll save this email here.

```
Hi Alex

This URL describes the directory structure that I would like to backup.  http://helpwiki.evergreen.edu/wiki/index.php/Folder_Structure_-_Dragonframe

I am currently using rsync over ssh to save it to my server, but I am open to having it backed up to mutlple places.  I guess uploadcare uses its own filenames for each file that is uploaded.

My use case requires the filenames not change, so let me know if that is / is not possible with uploadcare.

    best regards
    - Rob
