I am not sure of the hotel name (yet?) but there is some kinda glass
bead making thing downstairs starting at 4pm so I am tooootally going
to be down there for that.  Hopefully there will not be a long line.
(There are only 4 desks so I kinda guess I will have to wait.)

They offer free hard apple cider from 3pm to 5pm.  I had a bit and
Francois had some according to a photo I took.
