Today was the fifth of five virtual I-groups designed to give
leadership practice to men in the group.  Just five men in the group,
one night each gives a sense of what it's like and lets men see other
men leading the calls.

So I will be the leader leader of the next set of calls, planned for 6
calls starting in October.
