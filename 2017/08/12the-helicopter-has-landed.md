    Using thread, I suspended a bearing plate from a broom over my
    set.  I did not have a good way to adjust the length of the
    thread, so I used several layers of thick cloth (socks) on one
    side of the broom to allow the plate to descend toward the stage.

    Using Dragonframe's increments on a bezier curve, I got the plate
    to do some vaguely reasonable side to side motion as it came down.

    Special thanks to my friend Kai for providing the toy skeleton to
    be my RC bearing plate pilot!
