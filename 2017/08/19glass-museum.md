Allow more time when going to the glass museum in Azumino.   Or maybe
just go early.  We went around 10:45 and there was a queue for blowing
glass until 1pm.

I did get to talk to a couple of guys down in the glass blowing room.
Was soooo happy that they did not turn me away for being barefoot.  I
could easily imagine a rule, but apparently there was not.  Anyway I
had no problem with glass so it was fine.  Anyway, I also had no time,
so did not get to make a bottle or glass or anything.  Not sure what I
would have made.  Probably a glass, since it would be most useful for
me.
