Last night in the middle of drawing the circle which will help me
center the bearing on the stage, I had to reglue the guide which I
used to show where the pen should draw along the edge, so I paused the
livestream while it dried.

circle

1:31:35 livestream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo_ysqq0VXc finished drawing
the circle

) on MT3 so far.

Notes to self:

* don't have characters carry props that are too heavy for them
* don't use permanent ink if characters cannot carry it
* don't worry!
