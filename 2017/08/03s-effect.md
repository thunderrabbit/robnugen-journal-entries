Hopefully I have learned all the lessons I need to learn from this
situation.  I considered documenting everything in my journal, or a
gist,.. but a bunch of deleted lines in git will have to do.

Let's just say "Buffer 03s-effect.md has shrunk a lot; auto save disabled in that buffer until next real save"

I am going to go meditate now to regain some sanity and hopefully
shine some good light on all this.
