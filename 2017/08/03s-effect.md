From Renée

    Dear Rohini, Jill and Rob,

    Last night, my family went to Maneki no Yu hot springs and the
    same worker who told Rohini twice that tattoos were not allowed
    had a long talk with me. She was very upset that you, Rohini and
    Jill, entered the bath Saturday night with uncovered tattoos
    despite being told directly and firmly Friday night that you were
    not allowed to enter the bath like that. She made an exception
    Friday night and let you two stay in to enjoy the bath, but was at
    a total loss as to what to do Saturday night. She said she looked
    for me and Motoyasu to talk with me about it, but couldn't find
    either of us. Then, she basically gave up and just let you two
    stay in.

    This situation is beyond my comprehension. Motoyasu and I looked
    up hot springs that had private baths available for Saturday night
    rental and gave you the information for Yutori hot springs. Had
    you really felt it necessary to take a bath, you should have gone
    there. In going to Maneki no Yu, you promised to only eat dinner
    and not go in the bath as that would be a direct breach of the
    rules. However, according to the worker, that is exactly what you
    did. She mentioned that there were about six men with you. I took
    this to mean that she could not understand why they knowingly
    allowed you to go in the bath even though the group was told no
    uncovered tattoos are allowed in the bath area. So, in essence,
    everyone there who knew about this issue is responsible for
    problems caused by you entering the bath.

    Last night, I apologized for your completely incomprehensible
    behavior and promised it would never happen again. I promised that
    neither of you would be invited to my house, and that there would
    never be an opportunity for this type of disrespect for their
    rules again. She also told me when the owner will be back from his
    business trip, meaning I have to schedule a time to formally
    apologize. Do you see how much trouble you are causing by your
    actions?

    Your choices and behavior are out of moral and ethical bounds. You
    deliberately and knowingly broke rules that were explicitly
    explained to you. Rohini, you have been here long enough to know
    better. Jill, you are relatively new to Japan, and it is important
    that you learn that knowing and following rules is critical for
    good relations. Whether or not those rules make sense to you,
    until they are formally changed, they need to be abided by.

    Rob, as a co-coordinator of this event, I am choosing to include
    you in this communication.  I am requesting a direct email reply
    from each of you regarding this matter.

    Kind regards,

    Renée

Well shit, in some ways she is right.  I did not speak up and ask
Rohini and Jill not to go to the onsen against the rules.

So I replied to Renée, Rohini, and Jill:

## 1:43pm

    Hi Renee

    I am sorry I did not ask Jill or Rohini to not go into the hot
    springs the second night. I believe I would have specifically
    asked them not to if I had known it would come back to you.

    (I was very clear that people needed to speak quietly while in
    your house at night.)

    More deeply, my lack of speaking up probably comes from a fear of
    making people angry.

    To help make this situation right for you, Renee, may I contact
    the onsen to apologize?  My Japanese isn't great, but I am sure I
    can get them to understand I understand the situation and will
    make sure it doesn't happen again.


She replied twice

To Rob, Jill, Rohini:

    Dear Rob,

    Thank you for your immediate response. Yes, speaking up for what
    you know it right is extremely important.

    It doesn't matter if word gets back to someone or not. What is
    right is right. What is wrong is wrong.

    Thank you for your kind offer, but no, Motoyasu and I will take
    care of this in the proper Japanese way. We live in the
    neighborhood and need to apologize formally ourselves.

To Rob:

    Dear Rob,

    I understand your desire to be of service now and feel your
    sincerity, but that does not make any sense as you clearly stated
    to me that you are not going to work with me again. So, you have
    no relationship whatsoever with Maneki no Yu.

    Both Rohini and Will are both totally out of line. But, at least
    Rohini has the decency not to make a fuss on social media.

    For your sake, I hope you gather the courage to stand up for what
    you know is right. You can't just talk about being a man, you have
    to act like one.

I am choosing not to reply, and though I am putting this in my
journal, I am going to wipe it so it is only visible on bitbucket, in
an obscure URL.

I am doing this because I have an inkling of a fear that this could
get crazy, and I just want to kindof document things, but not spend
too much time on it, and certainly not make too much of a fuss.

I currently do not plan to reply to Renee, given that I made an offer
to support her, and she seems to be able to handle the situation on
her own.

This is taking too much of all of our time, so I do not want to stir
things up more.
