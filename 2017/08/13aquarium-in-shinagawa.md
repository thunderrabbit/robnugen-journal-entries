The aquarium in Shinagawa is more of a madhouse on holidays.  It has
really been modernized with touch screens, a rocking boat
(amusement park ride which does not go very high, but features at
least as shrill screams as any scream machine), some fireworks themed
lights, and that's before we get to see any real fish!

The most interesting thing for me is the plexiglass arch which forms a
tunnel under which we can walk and over which fish (mostly manta rays)
can swim.  It was nearly as if we were in the water.  I wondered how
easy it would be to make a glass tube so we'd be able to see fish
below us as well.  Seems like it might be a pain to keep clean,
though, with people walking on it, etc.

Ma's said her most interesting thing was seeing the turtle and
tortoise (in different exhibits).  She likes turtles.

Lin's favorite things were the dolphins, and penguins.

Ma also liked the penguins.

I would have liked the otters best if they had not been sleeping.  Maybe I
oughta come at a different time of the day to see their antics.
