After the workout, Lin and Ma showed me Candy Show Time(?) a shop
where they convert sugar, flavor, and food coloring into long noodles
before cutting the noodles into candy sized pieces.  It's pretty
ingenious, to be honest.

$700 for a custom order.  Hmmmm.  Maybe Dogecoin or another crypto
coin would be a unique design they hadn't done before.
