## 17:42 Wednesday 11 October 2017 JST

5:30pm meeting is underway, but I am only being asked questions via
text while here at JB since they are doing it in Japanese (at CB).

## 17:47

I'm dialed in now.

## 17:51

They are asking how the API works.  I explained it is like a web
server which gives just data instead of data and HTML.  They said they
understand that, but how does it *work*?

I explained I have never touched the code of this particular API.

Listening to this now, I am thankful I don't generally have to sit
through business meetings in Japanese.

## 18:00

I was told that they only had until 6pm, but the meeting is showing no
signs of being finished.

## 18:07

I think Nate is making some good points.

...

Basically he is saying what I said: "you should have said something
before (months ago)."

## 22:45 Wednesday 11 October 2017 JST

Okay the end result is that I will meet with them and answer their
questions about the API.
