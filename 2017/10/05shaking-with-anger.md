    Still fucking shaking with anger. I saw an old man grab a woman's
    ass just as her train arrived. He tried to run so I grabbed him and
	brought him back to her. She was like thank you and got on the train!

    Yo lady don't leave me hanging with this fucker; he grabbed your
    ass. so I yelled at him and let him go, never to see her again and
    a bunch people wondering wtf crazy barefoot mf yelling
    about. Shit.

That is what I posted on Facebook.  I am still a bit surprised but
dunno what I can do about it.
