I haven't tagged a journal entry as 'sleepy' in a while.  Tonight we
saw a movie and when I turned my phone back on I discovered I had
derped an online meeting by not entering it into my calendar (nor my
brain, obviously).  Got the meeting sorted out after returning home,
and she was understanding / comforting enough that I probably won't
offer lunch or anything.

Anyway, I cleaned up the
[Balance Differ](https://thunderrabbit.github.io/balance-differ/) a
little so it has less code related to the Time Calculator.  The writer
of Time Calculator hasn't responded to my request for a suggested
License, so I guess I will leave the license off.

Just for the record, I am completely ready for bed: showered,
flossed+brushed teeth, dried hair (doesn't take much)... but I am just
sitting in front of my computer like bluh. gtf to bed!
