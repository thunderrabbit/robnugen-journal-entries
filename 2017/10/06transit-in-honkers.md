We have begun our descent into Hong Kong; should arrive in about 20
minutes.  I have about 90 minutes, I think.  The last two years I made
my way through security in about 45 minutes, so I should have about 45
minutes (well 30 minutes) to chill around the gate.

Made it through security pretty quickly; I had about an hour when I
sat down at the gate.  I tried to get wifi to work on my phone, but
could not.  It works on my computer, though.
