Wow interesting! Today I thought I had completely missed the express
train to Shinjuku (non-stop from my station), misremembering that it
leaves at 6:14.  But it leaves at 6:21.

The train and I arrived at the station at the same time, but from past
experience, not only will all the seats be sold out, there will be a
queue of people hoping to buy tickets.  Today there was a queue of
people, but the tickets were still being sold! Wow so I got a ticket,
hopped on the train and zooom arriving in Shinjuku 20 minutes after
departure.
