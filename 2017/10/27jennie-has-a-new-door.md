Jennie has a pet door in our room now so she can go in and out.  The
door has a lock so that it can work both directions, neither
direction, or this xor that direction.

The guy cut a hole in the glass and it was not like on Mission
Impossible.  He used a diamond tip to make a circle and then a smaller
circle, and then a grid of cuts in the middle of the small circle,
then tap tap tapped with a metal rod.  It was nothing like silent spy
stuff in the movies.
