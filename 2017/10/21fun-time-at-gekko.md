Good time at Gekko, though a bit expensive overall.  4500 yen for 3
hours of all we can eat; 2 hours for 2/3 the price would have been
better for me..  BUT we got to have grilled bananas with cinamon, so
yeah that was pretty good.

Talked to Sebastian, Tim, Mi-chan, Sayori.  Sayori got progressively
intoxicated and entertaining, though it may have worn out after much
longer.  Funny that after we all got up to leave, her group took off
before everyone was out of the restaurant.
