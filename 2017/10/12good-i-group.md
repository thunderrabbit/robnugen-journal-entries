Great I-group today; I had chills from within when I got to yell at my
dad from when I was 7 years old.

He said "if there were 100 people from your class all in a line, you
would be the smartest."

He meant it well, but it's like hey fuck you don't put that on a 7
year old!  what is he going to do with that info?

just love me and say you're proud of me etc.  so I had a good dad give
me the messages I wanted to hear.  such a great relief
