I am at a hospital with Lin after a little fender bender involving a
guy's shoulder hitting her mirror hard enough to cut her hand as the
glass shattered into her open window.

The police officer came and suggested it will be easiest/cheapest
overall if they don't sue each other and just do 50/50 blame and call
it in to their respective insurance companies.  Otherwise they will
both lose their license etc etc.

Lin's fine, and the guy's apparently fine; goodness gracious I hope
she starts being more careful.
