Good lesson today at TB; they had just redone the place so I got a
grand tour of the show room.  Midori talked to some clients while
Tomoko gave me the tour.  They didn't have anything to check yet, but
I saw lots of word-for-word translations which we will have to clean
up later.

They actually had to leave 10 minutes earlier than normal, so I headed
out at 1:50pm.
