Here is my QR code which apparently lets me through the customs gate
in a breeze.  So nice that they have this service!  On my way out of
Narita, the lines to go through the human powered checkpoints were
quite long compared to the lack of lines in the automated gates.
Hmmm...  so I went over there and they helped me get registered free
of charge!  The QR code is good until the passport or visa expiration
date, whichever comes first.
