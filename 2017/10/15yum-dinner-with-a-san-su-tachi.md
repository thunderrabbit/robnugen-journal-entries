A-san-su treated us to dinner after we went to Machida with him and
a-san-su-mei.  Lin wanted to drive, which I didn't mind until we got
close to the station and tried to park.  Man we coulda saved a lot of
time by taking the train.

Anyway, they found no souvenirs in Machida area, but got some near our
station.  The we ate at our favorite buffet restaurant and talked
about eating less, esp at night, and eating better, esp in the
morning.  We shall see.
