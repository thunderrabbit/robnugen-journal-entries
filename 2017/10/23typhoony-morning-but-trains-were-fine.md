When I took the train this morning at 6:24am, it was running on time
no worries.  However, apparently trains started running late soon
thereafter.  One of my students happens to live near my same station
(新百合ヶ丘) and she said the trains were late, which caused her to
arrive late.  I am thankful for my policy of arriving 20+ minutes
early.
