I bought an AC adapter to use with my camera.  Today I had been able
to use the battery for about 90 minutes before it conked out.  The
adapter was 2000 yen from Amazon, but between 6000 and 8000 yen at Bic
Camera and Yodobashi Camera.  How will this play out in the long term?
Bic Camera connect with Amazon Buy Now inside their store?  I think
that is the simplest way (which Amazon would love).

Anyway, here is the video I uploaded today

The livestream was 1.3 hours https://youtu.be/nNzoOekbSUM

To make 5 minutes 41 seconds of video,
I have spent [78+ hours](

) on MT3 so far.
That is a ratio of
[4.3 hours per second](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=5.6+minutes+%2F+78.5+hours+in+hours+per+second).
really?  seems too long per second..
