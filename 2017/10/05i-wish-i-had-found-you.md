<p class="dream"> We watched as two security guards dove into the
river to help the tourists who had fallen out of the rafts.  The river
water came right up to the window, which surprised me, but was normal
to the locals.  We started climbing down the tower and walking towards
the rocket to launch to the mon.  I was like oh snap I forgot to pack!
I realized I did not have to panick; I manifested the packed bag in my
hands by visualizing what needed to be in it.  This action woke me
into waking reality but I went back to sleep.  Walking along the path
with my new friend, we saw one of her friends who gave me doe eyes
when we met. Nice to meet you and hug and kiss with the idea of more
to come.</p>

<p class="dream">Seeing the map of the town and the friendly history,
I just started crying, "I wish I had found you 3 years ago."</p>
