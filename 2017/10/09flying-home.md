As soon as I thought to write "flying home," I got a little pang of
guilt.  Isn't my home Houston?

Anyway, the flight from Perth to Honkers was a bit long, but fine.  I
slept for most of the first six hours and then watched the movie CHiPs
because it was listed as a comedy, but ..  it was pretty dark if it
was a comedy.  Suicide, lotta violence; I turned it off as the final
scene was ramping up.

Before getting on the flight from Honk Kong to Narita, I spoke a bit
with a couple on the flight.  I realized about halfway into the convo
that I had asked him where he was from, but not asked her.  They are
on a 13 day tour in Japan including Hakone, Nagoya, Takayama (not sure
where that is), Kyoto, Osaka.

They are sitting in row 50+ and I am in row 60+, with no one beside me
though I had decided I would make an effor to talk to the person who
sat beside me.

I have been sleeping about 1.5 hours at this point, and now have
written the above while waiting for the commercials before my selected
movie, The Transport, or something.  Ah, no, it's called The Passengers.
