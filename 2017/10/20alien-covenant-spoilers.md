The human story was fine but the science included a lot of
... fiction.  I saw the ending coming a mile away even though at the
very end I second guessed my correct original guess.  Holy cats they
threw away a lot of equipment to kill one little monster.  Why would
that couple hook up after having apparently been so focused on their
just deceased partners? Note to safety team: put alarm lights in the
shower as well.
