I glued the first curved piece which will turn the largest marbles
nearly 180 degrees.. perhaps 170..  I am not yet sure if the track
will work, which kinda spooks me. In Marble Track 3, if the characters
glue everything before I glue it, I won't easily be able to test a
portion of track that seems like it needs testing.  aka once I glue it
without testing, it will take double extra time to refilm them putting
the piece in place.

Anyway, here is the latest snippet.  New bits start around [1:28](https://youtu.be/TwaZkt_T7wk?t=1m28s).

(wow so lucky that I had made a copy of Time Calculator.  grun1.com is
throwing 503 errors now instead of showing the site, so I posted the
code on Github Pages.)
