Playing the stupid paperclip game cost me $50.  Okay, maybe I am
stupid instead of the game, but due to its clever design, I waited to
the last minute to get my train (for a substitute lesson in a location
with which I am unfamiliar).  My train ended up being late, I
missed(*) my next connection, and the client said "screw it" and
cancelled the lesson.

(*) got on the wrong line

Now I am back home and dammit the paperclip game is still noxious.

I closed the tabs (had it running in FF and Chrome) and wonder where
40 minutes went.
