For a couple weeks I tracked each yen spent, but I got behind
yesterday and just cannot bear to catch up today.  Blarg it's
neverending and what is the value?  To keep me from spending money
because it's moe joe to track it?

Ironically, after I got *paid* I started to spend more, but mostly it
was cause my phone died and I got behind.

Plus I have been tracking the yens in three (3) places, which is its
own pain in the butt.
