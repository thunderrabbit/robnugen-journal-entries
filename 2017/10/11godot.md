**Operating system or device, Godot version:**

OS X 10.12.6, Godot v2.1.4.stable.official

**Issue description:**

Run Godot first time, the Project Manager window appears, but cannot connect to sample templates.

    Can't connect to host: https://godotengine.org/asset-library/api

Looks like the same as #7545, but on OS X instead of Windows

**Steps to reproduce:**

    Open Godot in OS X
    Wait 30 seconds for it to load
    Click Templates tab in Godot Engine - Project Manager window
    Error message appears at the bottom

`Can't connect to host: https://godotengine.org/asset-library/api`
