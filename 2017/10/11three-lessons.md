The kids lessons were pretty good today.  The two new students (one in
each of my first two classes) are still not speaking, and I can't tell
if they are acting shy or don't understand..  anytime they speak, they
get the right answer, but getting them to speak is a stretch.  esp
with the other kids being so chatty.  I ain't sure how to handle it.
