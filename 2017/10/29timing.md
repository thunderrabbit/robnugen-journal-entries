I donâ€™t know why all this shit is piling up *and* the timing got
fucked up so I lost 2 hours today.  Lin is fighting with her family
because they are doing shit that reminds her of old shit.  I am
supposed to be doing shit for work but cannot concentrate with her
being so loud talking to her family about how crazy her family is.
