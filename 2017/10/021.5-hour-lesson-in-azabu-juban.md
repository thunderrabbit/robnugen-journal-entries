On Monday I got my bag back from ML, where I had left it the previous
week while substituting on the 7th floor.  I found out then that they
have a show room and after I got my bag, I went to it.  They have a
lock which can be reset with one key and relocked with any 1 of
another set of keys, which then becomes the only key which can unlock
it (except the reset key, of course).  The keys had grooves running
along the face, instead of just dimples.

The reset key's grooves looked a bit random, so I guess it is keyed to
that specific lock and not a super great grand master key that resets
any of those kind of locks (of course).
