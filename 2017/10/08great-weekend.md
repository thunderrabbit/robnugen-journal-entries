Yeah what can I say besides great except it wasn't completely what I
had hoped since I was looking for a bit more facilitation training.
It will come though.  This training was about the NWTA; next training
is more focused on facilitation.

I told the group I might not be back next year; I will more carefully
look at options for where would make the most sense for men from Japan
to do a training.
