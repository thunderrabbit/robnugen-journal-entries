## 16:40 Saturday 30 December 2017 -02

We are going to get on the flight in several hours from now.  I wonder
when I will start to reverse my sleep schedule.  We are 11 hours
behind Tokyo, so not as far away as possible, but close.

I have just gotten out my computer (to work on ConSwi) when I realized
I should be sleeping.
