## 14:45 Sunday 31 December 2017 -02

I am certainly getting tired.  I did not sleep the last 4 hours of the
flight as planned.  I kept working on Godot and then watched the last
couple or three episodes of Lucifer season 2.

The flight was scheduled to be 14 hours, so I have been awake about 17
hours since my last entry.

Okay, yes I woke up at 20:47 and it is now 14:49 the next day.

So, call them 20 and 14, so actually 18 hours as of this entry.

It is 01:49 Monday 1 January 2018 in Tokyo, and I should be sleeping
soon, but I guess we won't sleep for 1.5 hours after we land, so about
2 hours from now.
