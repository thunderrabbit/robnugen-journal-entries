I just got out of the lukewarm jacuzzi because it just didn't seem to
be getting any hotter.  The thermostat or something is broken so it
won't heat, so we taped a hose to the nearby shower faucet and put it
on full hot, which was too hot to touch at first, but then seemed to
get asymptotically close to the jacuzzi temperature, which never broke
32 degrees C.

Still had fun, and funny that the jacuzzi top float on the pool,..
floatiy enough for Rodrigo to sit on it.
