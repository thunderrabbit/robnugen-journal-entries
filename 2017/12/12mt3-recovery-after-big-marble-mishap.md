I added a record 7 seconds of video in just 2 hours.  Part of that was
certainly due to fewer disparate things going on, not the least of
which being that the stage was stopped from turning!

At this point:

1. the cutter is just about to cut the excess support off
the ramp base, after which the gluer will lift the base and glue the
pieces to it.

2. Mr Reversable is kicking the big marble around to the ramp, up
which it will be rolled back onto the stage.

3. Little brother is beginning to spin in circles on the topmost part
of the track.

4. Mr Green, Big brother, and the other guy are inspecting the area
   where the large marble went off the track.
