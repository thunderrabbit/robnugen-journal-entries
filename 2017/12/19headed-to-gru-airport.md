En route to GRU via taxi from Rodrigo's aparment.  I trust we are on
time; our flight is at 12:45pm and the airport is apparently 14
kilometers from here.  Traffic has started moving briskly; we are
traveling at 80 km/h, so we should ostensibly arrive in less than 14
minutes, so I guess we are good.  It's a domestic flight so maybe less
stringent through security.

Now traveling 120 km/h so I am sure we will be fine.

We made it to the gate right at boarding time.  The taxi ride to the
airport was fine, but then we had to wait in line for 30 minutes to
pay extra for a big bag full of presents and stuff.
