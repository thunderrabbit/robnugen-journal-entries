Lin and I just walked along the beach from the restaurante de
churrascos (sp) after pretty much gorging on all the offerings.

I saw some really neat rivulets on the beach (but forgot to take a
picture) where water seems to just spring from the beach.  I guess
that is exactly what's happening; water within the sand works its way
out and then comes down to the ocean.
