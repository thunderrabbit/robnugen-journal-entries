(transcribed while flying back to Haneda 20:08 Monday 01 January 2018 JST)

## 11:03am 24 Dec 2017

I completed the removal part after swipe, but now plan to refactor
code to let the pieces fall down by themselves.  It's good that I put
my PC away to come down and meet Lin; this way I can do the refactor
on paper first instead of trying to wing it in code.

But we were supposed to meet here at 11.  It's now 11:07 and she's not
here.  I will worry at noon.

## 11:10

She's back.

## 13:00

Got magnetism working and pieces fall just fine.
