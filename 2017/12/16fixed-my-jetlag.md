Good morning from SÃ£o Paulo!  My jetlag seems fine, though we are in a
timezone opposite that of Japan, where it is 6:30pm Saturday according
to https://time.is/Tokyo

My techique is to switch my clocks to my destination time as soon as
I get onto the airplane, and then sleep or stay awake during the
flight according to the target schedule.

The more timezones changed, the longer the flight and therefore more
time available to do the switch.

For those of you reading from the future, the rate of change for me is
roughly one timezone per 2 hours of travel time.  (We were in a Boeing
777 and then an Airbus A-380 (my first time to fly one of those).)
