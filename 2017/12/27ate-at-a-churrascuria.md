Lin and I ate lunch with R & D and D's auunt R and three of R's
nephews.  I took the longest to eat due to chewing chewing chewing.
The meat was a bit tough given that we arrived near the end of their
lunch session.  D drove me, Lin and his aunt R in the Range Rover,
while R drove his three nephews in a rental car.

Now, shopping.
