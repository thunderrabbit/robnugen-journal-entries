Dug a hole for myself on the beach but it was too far from the waves
to bury me in the sand.  Headed down to the water a bit more and
meditated with Lin.  Kept moving down toward the water so I was in the
waves from 0 to 40cm deep, avg 2~10cm.  たのしかった

Got Godot app to highlight clicked items today and got it to highlight
subsequent mouseovered items and unswipe backtracked items.

Right now 8:00 at Lin's dad's restaurant calling her sisters and he
wants them to sell products in Japan and oldest sister is like False.

But the best news is for MT3.  Her dad gave me hundreds of ice cream
spoons of a shape I had never seen before.
