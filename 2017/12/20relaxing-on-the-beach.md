Relaxing on the beach, we got some delicious drinks: *manga con leche*
(sp) for me and acerola for Lin.  Mine was sweeet and *muito
deliciouso* (sp).

A man came by with a young boy in his arms, and we ended up giving him
R10 $3. Then other guys selling shirts, cashews, art, and maybe one
more before we ended up just leaving instead of saying no no no no.
