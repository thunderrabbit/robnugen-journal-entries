While on the phone with BoA credit card to close my account, I got a
call from JB: "hey yeah why aren't you at work?"

Stomach sank link oh damn are you kidding me?

Turns out they hadn't sent me the schedule for December, but I
certainly could have been more proactive to check.  I have set a
reminder for the 28th of each month to make sure I have the dates in
my calendar for the subsequent month.
