Leaving Fortaleza today (and my glasses, unless I happen to find them
on last scan of the beach)

## 06:58 Sunday 24 December 2017 -03

Didn't find my glasses during a quick walk along the beach near where I
lost them.   We did find breakfast buffet quite lovely, and I can make
do with Lin's glasses.

Headed to the airport now to fly to Presidente Prudente via Sao Paulo
(to see our friends R&D).
