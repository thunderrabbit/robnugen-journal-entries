Wow we arrive in just 4 hours.  I tried to stay up longer by watching
a movie, but maybe I should have gotten out my computer.  I had had a
headache from being up so late so I didn't think I could program well.

I slept most of the flight already, it seems.  11 hour flight, 7 hours
down.

It is basically 8pm in our final destination, so I want to sleep again
soon.

My theory is that I switch my timezone to the destination time as soon
as I get on the plane.  We will be in Dubai just 2 hours so I skipped
that destination in my plan.

Okay I just switched the clock on my computer.  The "-03" looks weird
to me, but that's how emacs presented the timezone.

I shan't dig into it now; I want to work on Godot before bedtime.

Woah we have free wifi on this flight, it seems!

They give a free 20MB taster for 2 hours.  I shan't be watching cat
videos, but it's enough to check email.

It is *not* enough to push my journal repo more than a few times, so I
will refrain.
