At my third of three kids classes here at JB, we had a new student, 4
or 5 years older than the others.  The two previously-oldest girls in
the class suddenly stopped messing around and tried significantly
harder than usual.  Such a nice change of pace!  I used a technique I
learned from Tariq: keep having them switch conversation partners and
repeat the same conversation with a new partner.  They gained
confidence each time and it went quite well.  (It helped that there
were 4 students in class today whereas it had always been 3.)
