Well!  I discovered something new about Tokyo trains.  If I *promise*
to pay at the other end, it's possible to get a free entry ticket.  I
did not think to take a picture of the ticket, but its kanji started
with 無 and may have started with 無理 but I am not sure I can readily
identify the second kanji.

Anyway, I called Ty and he met me at his station to let me out.  And
gave me 1000 yen so I can get home and maybe get a bite to eat.

Headed to Paola's house now to enjoy lunch and laugh about leaving
wallets at home!
