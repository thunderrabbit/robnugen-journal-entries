I am quite happy with at least half of the frames I shot today.
Fortunately, I am happy with the difficult ones!  They were the frames
in which the big marble rolled down the M Splitter and then slammed
against the wall, driving the white pole all the way into the wall.

After the ball hit the floor, I had the other characters react to the
"sound", but upon playback, they react too quickly.  The frames of
those characters all moving toward the sound were all pretty easy to
take, so I feel good about re-shooting them.  <del>I estimate it's
about 15</del> I need to delete only 7 frames in all, so just the last
half second at the very end of the video below:
