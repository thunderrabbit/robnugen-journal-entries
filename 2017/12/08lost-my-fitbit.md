I cannot understand how I could have lost my fitbit in two days.  I
received it from Prentiss on Monday night; I charged it the next day;
I wore it for two days, and now I cannot find it.

I didn't put it anywhere specific; it should be clipped to the pants I
was wearing.  Where did it go?

So sad.
