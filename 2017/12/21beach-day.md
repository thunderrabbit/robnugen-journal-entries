## evening 21 December 2017

Great view of semi-fragile sand dunes, but not safe to climb ざんねん.
Hot girls including one with braces.  OMG why do so many adults have
braces here?

Finished algorithm for the app (LeSwipe / ConSwi) to deal with linking
swipes to shapes while chilling in a self made hole in the beach.

(pictures coming soon?)

Quite interesting to see the waves coming in over the very-flat beach,
so it came up significantly farther and farther with each passing unit
of time.  There was a bridge from the steps to the shore but even it
did not stay dry at high tide.

Before taking video of kids leaping from the restaurant balcony into
high tide, I took several pics of the water coming in, which I hope to
make into an animation.

wow so much to see in Brazil!

Played table football with Artulio(sp) as sister whined or watched
videos.  He never cared that I never understood, and he never tried to
understand when I spoke verbally.

At the end I threw a peace sign and he gently corrected me with throat
slit pantomime.  I guess it is serious bzns.
