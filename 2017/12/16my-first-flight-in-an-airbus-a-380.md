Last night was my (and Lin's) first time to travel in an
[Airbus A380](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380).  Our flight
was around 15 hours from Dubai to SÃ£o Paulo on Emirates, which is
apparently Airbus' largest A380 customer.

I was impressed with how relatively quiet the plane was (sitting just
at the trailing edge of the wings) during the entire flight.  We had a
hard landing with a bounce, but the aircraft came to a stop very
quickly and smoothly.
