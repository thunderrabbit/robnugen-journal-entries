## 14:24 Friday 29 December 2017 -02

Actually, tomorrow is our last full day, but some of it will be spent
flying to Sao Paulo.  Our flight to Dubai leaves at 1am Sunday
morning.

We just finished lunch after Dom and Rose taught me and Jorge(sp) to
play rummy.  I had never played before.

The pool has just been vacuumed and now it's time to swim!
