Here is Brazil, cashew fruit are available at any fruit stand.

I tried the fruit.  So much water spilling out I think it should be
called watermelon.  Very stringy and not so delicious, but edible.

Once I finished the fruit, I looked at the stem looking thing.

Wait, so you're telling me there's a cashew nut in here?  That's
awesome!

It was too hard to crack with my fingers, so I used my teeth to try to
crack it open.  It was actually chewy, not hard, so I bit it again a
couple of times to try to get it to open.

Eww hang on, that tastes bitter.  Yo wow ow holy cats it's terrible
flavor.

I felt a tiny bit woozy walking to the bar to find something to wash
down the flavor.  Was it poisonous??

Here is what I wrote to myself:

    Note to self
    
    Do not chew cashew nut case to get the cashew out
    
    Worst taste ever
    
    I have consumed
    Two pieces of cake
    One cup of yogurt
    One glass of orange juice
    
    And I can still taste the cashew shell flavor

    Cup of yogurt, cup of porridge, and 15 minutes later, I can still
    taste it. It kinda feels like it damaged my tongue like a burn (acid)?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashew#Cashew_nut_and_shell

    The shell of the cashew nut contains oil compounds which may cause
    contact dermatitis similar in severity to that of poison ivy,
    primarily resulting from the phenolic lipids, anacardic acid, and
    cardanol. Due to the possible dermatitis, cashews are typically
    not sold in the shell to consumers.

Thanks, Wikipedia!
