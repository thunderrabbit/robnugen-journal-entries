Been working all morning on sb new admin site.  I got it deployed and
essentially working last night.  Now need to deploy the API, which
should be way less work.  Nate still has not set the Nameservers
though so even when I get it finished, he won't be able to see it
(unless he sets up local /etc/hosts file)

Going to meet Ty soon to figure out this protocol we are developing.
