After working 3 hours (5 lessons) near Lazona, I'm eating cold lunch
in Akihabara across the street from GG lesson. I have Lin's sister's
heavy-as-hell suitcase.  (Now I know why gorillas cannot break them)

Lesson was great; everyone was there!  Yoko, Maki, and Atusko all
brought sweets!  Mayumi and Toshie both did homework!
