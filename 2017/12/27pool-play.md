Played with the nephews in the pool for a couple of hours.  Activities
included:

* entering the pool with various techniques
* counting consecutive successful toy catches
* bouncing an empty 2 liter bottle
* launching said bottle
* riding on jacuzzi cover like a raft
* filling 2 liter bottle with bubbles from jacuzzi
* jumping into pool for distance

But most importantly, no one got hurt
