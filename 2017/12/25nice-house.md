## Christmas Day in Presidente Prudente

At R&amp;D's house in Presidente Prudente, Brazil, which looks to me
like a house I would see in a movie.  Pool in the yard overlooked by
floor to ceiling
glass door/walls separating indoor and outdoor living/dining areas

Super sweet talking wtih Rose last night about jacks and marbles in
the street vs kids with cellphones now.

Jesse and Angelica joined us for dinner.  I asked about their
itinerary and learned they live in London.  I recognized an accent
only when she said "I live in London now" I feel silly for having
copied her accent, "ah there it is 'I livin Londonau'" but she has
only been there for two years, but dang if I was not feeling nervous
in such a nice crib where I sure as heck don't belong do I and
wondering why I didn't buy 1000 BTC when it was a dollar.  Screw it no
regrets look forward love and learn.
