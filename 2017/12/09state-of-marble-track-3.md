1. The (first?) M-Splitter is complete.  The big marbles roll its
   entire length, and medium sized marbles fall through.  They do not
   yet have a lower track to catch their fall, though, and big marbles
   roll immediately off the track instead of around the hairpin turns.
2. I am beginning to develop character traits for each character, and
   have defined some of their unique characteristics, though I have
   not settled on names for them.
3. The small character with white body and green head may become the
   primary marble pusher.  He has just released the big marble from
   the top of the track and discovered that it rolled right past the
   hairpin turn.  Everyone rushed over to see what happened, but the
   frames are too quick.  As of this writing, I plan to delete the
   last 7 frames and retake them, giving the characters proper time to
   react.

During I-group yesterday, I mentioned Marble Track 3.  Some of the men
asked about it, so I wrote a summary:

TL;DR: this links to a playlist of video clips https://mt3s.robnugen.com/  (5 clips total)

Longer story:

Previously, I had created Marble Track 2 and posted a video of it to
Youtube.  The youtube link is available at https://mt2.robnugen.com
Many people seemed to like the video and some people asked how I made
the marble track.

After some thought, I realized it would be ridiculous to literally
show people how to make a marble track, and even more
ridiculous/amazing to create a stop motion animation of characters
making a marble track.

So, that is exactly what I am doing while making Marble Track 3.

Each second of video takes roughly an hour behind the scenes taking
photos and moving characters around the set.  I estimate 5 more years
to go on the project.
