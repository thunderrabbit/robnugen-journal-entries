Though I got a seat so I could use my computer to write on the way
home, I got sidetracked by having my hot milk tea bottle fall and roll
under the seat as I was getting out my computer.  Not wanting to
juggle my computer and milk tea, I just ended up using my phone
instead of writing.  Still got a fair bit done, writing to Emmy and
Will.  Thanks, gravity!
