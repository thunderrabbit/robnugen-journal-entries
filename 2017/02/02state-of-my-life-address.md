* I've staffed 3 [NWTAs](https://nwta.mkp.org/) for [Mankind Project](https://mkp.org/).  Most recent two were in Perth, in October 2016 and October 2015.
* on 31 January, I presented Tokyo's first Head Heart and Soul presentation, as suggested by John Gaughan in Perth last year.
* 14 people in attendance and great supportive response
* There are 6 men in the Toyo I-group, including 3 men who have not yet attended NWTA.
* I expect the group to expand to as many as 9 men in the next month or two.
* I'd like to consider running circles on more nights, and possibly co-gender groups as well, to help introduce women in Tokyo to [Woman Within](https://www.womanwithin.org/)
* I've been invited to attend monthly I-group Council meetings, as the representative for Tokyo I-groups.
* Today is the first week I used Noisy to wake up for my Thursday morning lesson.
* I haven't (yet?) made an entry for Noisy in "Items" category of my wiki
* I've nearly finished my cage to keep Jennie off my desk which will soon have my marble track under construction.
* I plan to do a stop-action animation so it will look like little pipe-cleaner people made the track.
* I also plan to livestream the building of the track, which will take *ages*.
