Nice. Just by proverbially raising my hand to ask for help, I have
found many people to help.  There exists a Mankind Project Global
Support Team, specifically to help MKP communities in new areas.  It's
all grassroots, like UU churches.  Not some big entity which says "now
let's expand *here*."  Organic growth, just as nature intended.
