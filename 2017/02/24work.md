I just found out that the Big Change I made to clients website last
month broke some important functionality that I didn't have an
automated test set up to catch the mistake.  Now am putting an old
version of the code on test website so they can use the old version
for the old functionality ..  basically supporting two websites for
them (well 3, counting the frontend) while I fix the code to work with
new data structure.

dang.
