Three hour wake-up call had me angry at one point and sad at the end.
Headache now, but not sure if it's from too much computer moreso than
the conversation.  Lots of attacks on the way my life is going: no
kids equals alone in the end.

Yeah so what I've come to recognize is that I trust my intuition /
future abilities to take care of myself and my relationship.  I *do*
believe there's a spiritual component to "all of this" (and at a
different level I believe "all of this" is a physical component of the
real world), and trust I am where I need to be in my life.
