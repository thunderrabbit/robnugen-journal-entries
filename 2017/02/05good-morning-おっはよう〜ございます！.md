## 05:54 Sunday 05 February 2017 JST

I woke up early today; I asked Noisy to wake me up at 5:25 so I could
"get some work done" before heading to see Mikarin's piano recital.
I'm bummed I'll miss SOGO (again (last week was due to choosing to
prepare for Head Heart and Soul presentation (and the week before was
cancelled by the organizers))), BUT as I sat down to "do work" I felt
cold, tired, and was like, boom

"I have an idea!" and I went outside and ran.  Well, jogged.  Up the
hill (as far as the second street light, after which I walked), up the
next little hill, down the stairrrrrrs, and then jogged back up the
hill and the next hill and then was going to head home, but fuckit not
tired yet so down the staiiirrrrrrrs again then jogged up the hill and
back past the pokestop to our house.

I think I will do this regularly.  I'll skip it on the days that Noisy
is set at that time so I can go to work, but do it on other days.  And
then maybe go to bed; who knows, but I'm going to start waking up
early again.
