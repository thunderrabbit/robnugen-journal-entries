Though I went to SOGO yesterday (and had a great time), I have been
working too much.  My pinky still hurts, but less now that I use it
less.  My shoulders are tense.. perhaps I should switch my mouse to
left hand again.

But, I have now gotten Redmine installed via Ansible, and another
website installed on same server.

Still need to install one more site on this server, and hopefully this
time I can figure out why it went sideways before.

Then four more servers featuring five more websites.

Next year, containers (maybe)
