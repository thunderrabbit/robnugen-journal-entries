Now ansible is reporting it cannot connect to AWS though I am sure
nothing has changed on this virtual machine.  Especially nothing
related to the AWS keys.

I'm spinning up a new box now; if that doesn't work, then I'll assume
the problem is not on my end and switch to a different project.

Huh.  new box works.  I'm not sure what happened to the old box.
