I'm headed home on the Nambu Line because I forgot to bring my
books with me for my afternoon lessons.  I have as many as 6 30 minute
lessons over a 3 hour period, and I like to have my notebook to take
notes.  But realistically, I can just write notes on separate paper
and transcribe it to the notebook later.  Part of me wants to look
prepared (more than "yeah I forgot my notebook again").

Benefits of going home:

* solid internet connection to join online I-group
* save money on lunch
* get to see my babychan (if she's home)
* nice and warm on the train instead of freezing my ass off outside
* get a bit more exercise walking from our station to the house (and back again)
* getting a chance to write in my journal on the way home (and the way back out, presumably)

Downsides of going home:

* might be late for I-group or 2pm lesson if train is delayed
* spend money on train (but not as much as on lunch)
* it's a little moe joe to go back and forth

Hmmm!
