Before Tokyo men's circle tonight, I met Christine to learn a bit more
about the training she has done, and to get a NIN poster from when she
worked on their tour!!

I stopped by The Pink Cow to say HI and get the best burrito in the
world.  Went outside to look for Christine and three (3) police
officers approached me and asked if they could go through all my
stuff.  I'm glad I had left my bag inside The Pink Cow!  They were
like "yeah you are barefoot so we thought it was strange (and decided
to use that as an excuse to search you)
