Well, I have recovered *nearly* to the point that I was 24+ hours ago
before killing connectivity to my VM.

I tried restoring the old VM, but didn't get it working.  It's a
non-issue at the moment.  I have a new VM to which I can connect from
my host (allowing SublimeText2 (Registered) to save files to it), and
from a sibling guest VM which provisioned the new VM using Ansible.

*Eventually* I will consider using Packer to do the provisioning, but
I shall leave that for after I get my current servers all on
newer version of Ubuntu.
