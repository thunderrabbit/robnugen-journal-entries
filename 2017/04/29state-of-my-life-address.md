1. I wonder why I'm writing an SOML now before the end of the month. Usually they are on the first, or recently, late, or very late.
2. Lin and I are watching Alien Domicile, and I cannot say I am really expecting much.
3. For time considerations, I abandoned upgrading to Ubuntu 16.  Updating all my projects to use PHP 7 *and* figure out Ansible was too much.  Upgrading to only Ubuntu 14 allows me to stay with PHP 5 and just focus on Ansible
4. And recently, focus on creating a new VM for use locally
5. Because I unexpectedly killed connectivity to my former local VM and needed to recreate it.
6. Lin will soon go to her second meeting regarding purchase of 1000万円 company.  This time with a CPA to evaluate its expected future value.
7. I have not done anything with the three styrofoam blocks I bought at the beginning of the month.
8. We just bailed on Alien Domicile after Lin was like "meh" and I confirmed our suspicions with [these reviews](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6574700/reviews)
9. We are watching an introduction to Bitcoin!  I hope Lin will be more interested in BTC after this.
10. Aw man.  She was like "meh" despite my passionate plea that she try to understand the future potential.
11. Now we are watching Secret Life of Pets
