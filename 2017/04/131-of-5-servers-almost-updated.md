It looks like I've nearly got AB's server rebuilt with new Ubuntu OS.
I just need to put the crontab entries on it, and run it through all
the tests.  yay.

CB's two servers are close to being almost updated, but I just have
not taken the time to do them.  Glad they do not have to have mysql
data on them.  Just gotta deal with a big disk.  oof.


sb's server is not really close; I have not gotten Redmine sorted, nor
the actual main site.  boo.

FS's server is kinda simple, so I hope it will go quickly, but I have
not started on it.  bah.
