Pretty much got everything sorted.  I never got the old AB VM to have
connectivity again, but my new AB VM is in better shape than the old
VM ever was:

The new VM

# can send emails
# can easily have deploys target specific branches
# uses domain names that differ from production by a single character (.cojp vs .co.jp)
# uses Ubuntu 14
# is fully deployed via Ansible

and that last item means if I lose my physical computer, I can pretty
quickly recreate my development environment, at least as far as that
VM is concerned.

Hooray for losing connectivity to that old VM!
