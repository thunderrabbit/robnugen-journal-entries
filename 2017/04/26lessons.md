Today's first three lessons went really well by simply having a four
part target per lesson: questions, text, test, game.  Thanks, Yuji!

I did a gamification of the questions portion of the lessons.  For
question correctly answered within about five seconds, the student
received a "prize" (single card from
[Stacker Crackers](https://www.learningresources.com/product/stacker+crackers--8482-+sight+words+game.do)).
The cards give them something to fiddle with while other students are
answering questions, and hopefully inspires them to answer correctly.

For the 6-year-olds, I focused on three questions: "How are you?" "How
old are you?" and "What's your name?" all spoken at native speeds.
They had about 85 to 90% accuracy on distinguishing the first two
questions.  100% answering the third question, but I kept it in there
due to its prevalence.

Today's last two lessons went well, though I was tired.  Focused on
cadence and intonation for the last part of the first of those two
classes.
