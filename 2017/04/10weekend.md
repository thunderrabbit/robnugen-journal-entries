This past weekend it rained, so SOGO was cancelled.  I was kinda glad
because I feel behind schedule on getting servers running with
Ansible.  I've abandoned jumping from Ubuntu 12 to Ubutnu 16 this
time. I'm focusing on Ubuntu 14 with the hopes that having this
groundwork laid (on the groundwork laid by Ansible), the next upgrade
will be ready ahead of schedule.

An MKP graduate called me while he's in town, but I did not end up
meeting him because of the rain and overworking myself.  moe joe.
