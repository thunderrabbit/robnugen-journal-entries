work work work tired tired tired but fun talking about science-related
topics.  Before the lessons started at 2pm I was watching videos on
Youtube and like snapped out of a reverie like oh-shit-what-timeisit?
and thank goodness I still had ample time to make it to the lesson but
dannnng that was spooky.  I set an alarm on my phone to alert me 30
minutes beforehand.

I'm on the train now in Shinjuku.  I waited in line 15 minutes before
the train was scheduled to leave and just barely got a seat.

There's an interesting phenomenon for train queues during rush hour.
If a train is already at the platform, and the second train will
arrive before the first one leaves, passengers line up at each door of
the second train at just about 110% capacity of the seats.  Other
passengers arrive, see there are enough people in line to ensure they
will not get a seat, so go to the first train.  Or queue up for the
*third* train, on which they will (almost) certainly get a seat.

GG lesson was great tonight.  We actually used the book to great
effect.  And Y was inspired to ask a question.  I wonder if the book
helped.
