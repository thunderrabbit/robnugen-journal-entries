work work work tired tired tired but fun talking about science-related
topics.  Before the lessons started at 2pm I was watching videos on
Youtube and like snapped out of a reverie like oh-shit-what-timeisit?
and thank goodness I still had ample time to make it to the lesson but
dannnng that was spooky.  I set an alarm on my phone to alert me 30
minutes beforehand.
