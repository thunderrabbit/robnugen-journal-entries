Lin is bitching at her mom.  In me it's triggering anger.  I just want
to yell SHUT THE FUCK UP GODDAMMIT because with them bitching I can't
work, nor sleep.

I know this reaction is my problem.  I am going to sit (and meditate)
a bit.

Meditation worked wonders.  My feelings shifted from "fuck you" to
understanding that they have needed to get this fight out for a long
time.  I gave Lin hugs and kisses when she finally came upstairs.
They fought for over an hour.. must have been tiring!  She said they
came to a good understanding, though.
