I went to Astroworld today for the Season Pass Sneak Preview and rode Taz's Texas Tornado 21 times.  Twenty-one.  I rode the very first time it ran that night because I was the very first one in the park and first in line with Jennifer and Karen, who I met while we waited for the park to open.
<p>
I rode it essentially 9 times in a row (had to get out, go around and get back in line each time) and then the line was longer than waiting for 1 train cycle so I got my season pass processed.
<p>
During those 9 times, I was next in line for the ride when none other than Clyde Drexler (*) got to <em>glide</em> in front of everyone and do a photo shoot with two kids in the front seat. After the pictures, he squeezed his tall self into the seat and rode 1 time.
<p>
I took pictures from my side view of him and all that.  Then I got to ride in the seat that he rode in.  I'm not a huge fan, but there was some implicit prestige with that spot.
<p>
I took pictures from on the ride and got in trouble with Kevin and I'm sorry about that but I'm glad I got the pictures. Maybe (just maybe) I'll get some scanned and put them on here.<br>

<p>
So I went and got my season pass processed and came back but the ride was temporarily closed during rain so Jennifer, Karen and I chilled and rode the Mayan Mindbender 3 times consecutively (did not have to get out).  I took a picture while inside that ride (I'm a slow learner); I hope it comes out!  (It's an indoor ride and I used a flash).
<p>
Then we rode Dungeon Drop once and wanted to ride Excalibur, but *no one* was there to ride it and the operators said we had to get 25 people before we could ride!!  How ironic that there were too few people in the park!!!
<p>
Back to the Tornado where we rode 4 times consecutively without changing seats and then Jennifer and Karen left and I switched seats between each ride (did not have to leave the station) for a total of 21 rides.  The last ride was full of park employees and I was in the front left seat, exactly where I started that night. It was the last time the train ran that night!  Awesome.

(*) Clyde "the Glide" Drexler is a professional basketball player for the Houston Rockets.<br>
He has just signed on to be the head coach for the University of Houston Cougars.
