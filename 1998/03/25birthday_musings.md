<title>Birthday Musings</title>

<p class=date>Wednesday 25 March 1998</p>
<p>
This is my page.<br>
For some reason I sometimes feel that it's inadequate- not worthy of being viewed by zillions of people.. that they would look briefly and scoff and leave.
<p>
But who cares, eh? I won't know if they hated it, unless they take the time to send me email (which is actually more flattering than them just leaving) and my counter will just slowly click up and up and I'll see that people are at least stopping in to look.
<p>
So am I actually afraid that my counter will click higher and higher and no one will write?  No one will say, "hey!  I like The PIN!  I love the Feel Good Net!  Keep it up.  keep it up"<br>
That is actually what scares me more.  What if <em>everyone</em> comes by and no one cares?
<p>
When I surf, I am most impressed with people who have really put themselves on their page through art, pose, poetry, photography.. I like to know what people love!  Or more precisely I like to know that people are pursuing what they love!!
<p>
So what about me?  I love crafting my page. I sometimes get so anal about making it consistent that I spend a lot of time doing that.. Consistency also helps me keep track of what all is here and lets me be pretty certain that all my links work.<br>
Have you noticed that every page (except for 1 (I think)) is the same color??
<p>
Anal.
<p>
(But wait.. I don't mean "I love crafting my page" like it's the core of my existence, but I love crafting my page to describe what I do when I'm actually living life.)  (just wanted to clear that up)
<p>
But I enjoy messing with it, and I think I may try to loosen up some and maybe make a page be a different color.  Maybe a random color by sticking in BGCOLOR="abcdef".  I think I'll even do that for this page, which would mean there are <b>TWO</b> pages on my site with different background colors!!!!!!!!
<p>
Wow.  I just checked what the color looks like on my browser and I love it!!!!<br>
I absolutely take that as a sign that I'm on the right path.

<p>
Oh yeah.. so it's my birthday and I'm at work and I really haven't done much work today, but I have done some surfing and html crafting.. (This is one of the lovely perks of being a programmer. Some days I just don't do anything productive for The Company)<br>
The love/hate perk I have is ISDN web access from my house. I stay connected too darn much for my own good.
<p>
I have pretty much decided to not be working here by August or September.  I respectfully thankfully intend that I will be making money doing something I love.  Or that I'll be doing more of what I love and have more time to do it.  <br>
I don't really care about the dollars; I thankfully trust the money I need will arrive.
<p>
It's 16:34 by the clock on my phone.<br>
Tonight the youth group, Wende, my mom, her husband, and his daughter (my step sister!  I have a sister now!) Alicia will meet at House of Pies at 19:00.
<p>
See ya.</p>
