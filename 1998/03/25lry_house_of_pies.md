<title>LRY dinner at Houst of Pies</title>

<p class=date>25 March 1998</p>
<p>
The LRY dinner was at House of Pies tonight.  Because it was my birthday, my mom, her husband Jon and his daughter Alicia were all there. Jon's friend Donna showed up just because, and LRY youth Paul, Elaine, Laura, kT, Dennis were there and Wende got there a bit late because of work.
<p>
I had big fun and enjoyed briefly describing my college experience to Elaine, who plans to attend Texas A&M in the fall.
<p>
Alicia grabbed and munched cottage fries that I offered her with my fork, and Jon took composite pictures of my body with Elaine's head and Alicia's body with Laura's head, made possible with the mirror between our tables.
<p>
(I'll ask him to scan those so I can put them on here)
<p>
I got a weird little wall hanging thing made from "found stuff" by a guy named Tony Romano.  Hmmm.
<p>
I waved my fork dancingly in the air as everyone boistrously sang Happy Birthday to me.
<p>Yay!!</p>
