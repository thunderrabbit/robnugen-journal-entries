This night the LRY met at Macaroni Grill for dinner.  Adam <!Wood>, kT <!Hammons>, Laura <!McCuen>, Wende <!Whitlock> and I were all there.   Actually, Wende got there a little late since she had been stuck at work.
<p>
The most fun thing about Macaroni Grill is they cover the tables with white paper and give crayons so patrons can express their artistic talents. kT and I expressed our talents maliciously at each other, resulting in an illegible scrawl of color in our corner.<br>
Of course, it was all in fun... ;)
<p>
As the waiter shredded parmesan cheese over my noodles, I tossed the few shreds that landed on the table onto kT's shirt. The funniest thing is she didn't notice until she went to the restroom!  Ha!
<p>
Then when I got back from the car, there was pepper or something gritty all over my chair. Heh.  I didn't notice it 'til I sat down cause the chair was black.
<p>
I tipped the waitress with 4 dollars including a two dollar bill.
<p>
After the evening, I took our art and pinned it up in the LRY room at church.</p>
