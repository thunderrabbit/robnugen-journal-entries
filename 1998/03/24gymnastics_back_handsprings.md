<title>More Gymnastics</title>

<p class=date>Tuesday 24 March 1998<br></p>
<p>
Today I got to attend gymnastics again after the gym was closed for 2 weeks.  During those two weeks the moved to a larger facility and I love it!  The new place is way bigger and has two floors, two runway trampolines, two big trampolines, a vault, 1 high bar, 3 uneven bars, several low bars, and plenty of room for more stuff that hasn't been installed yet!
<p>
I did not really stretch or practice or anything for the two weeks, so I was a bit cautious on the floor.  My first bigger passes were just roundoffs, testing out my leg which I hurt playing Ultimate this weekend.
<p>
It felt pretty good, so I pulled some roundoff back flips, and once I did 3 goods ones in a row, I did a punch front flip.
<p>
Then I did some standing back handsprings! I haven't done them in years and years, and way back then I didn't do them super well.  But today they were as good as ever and getting better. I need to stretch out my tummy before I get too crazy doing those again.
<p>
Kenneth spotted me on about 4 in a row and I got pretty sloppy because of tired arms.
<p>
So I bounced over to the runway trampoline where Sarah, Tanya and Ashley were tumbling.  Sarah was doing roundoff backs with two twists; Tanya and Ashley were doing mostly back flips with 1/2 twists or just sloppy back flips.
<p>
I did some simple front flips and tried a couple of 1+1/4 back flips but never really got them straight enough to go all the way.
<p>
All too soon our 55 minutes was up, though we often stretch it out to and hour 15 minutes...  Not tonight.
<p>
See ya soon!!!</p>
