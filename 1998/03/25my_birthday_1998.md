<title>My 28th birthday!</title>

<p class=date>25 March 1998</p>
<p>
Today I was accepted into <a href=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~airyn/spiritring.html>The Spirit Ring</a> and I have spruced up my page a bit in hopes that more people will come see my site.  I had 710 hits on my japanese counter and 318 hits on my other counter... We'll see what happens...
<p>
At work I found a quarter on my desk with a note written on the back of one of my business cards:
<p>
<pre>
       Happy B-day.
         This is for the 
          M&M Machine  
              - Molly
</pre>
<p>
I bought a small handful of M&Ms before I sat down.
<p>
Since then I haven't actually worked yet today. I've just been goofin' around on my page and stuff.
