<b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>

I normally don't do State of My Life Addresses so chronologically
close together, but I am now.

At work I've been working much longer hours than normal and I'm still not getting my project done as fast as I want.  I'm working in C++ and I'm stuck on a problem I'm having with some objects written by another group. The objects are designed to create a menu system and allow user input, etcetera. However, for some reason I can't get them to trap CTRL-Z the way I want. It's been pissin' me off for 4 days now.

I just found out about dates that Tori Amos is going to play on her tour!  I'm way excited! I'd like to see her in Los Angeles, because then I can see Jen, who is my Tori Amos fan soulmate! Jen's birthday is the same as mine (25 March).

I'm listening to <b>nine inch nails</b> <em>closer to god</em> CD.

This weekend I'm going to Austin to play Ultimate!
