<title>Centex according to Rod</title>

<p class=date>Sunday 22 March 1998</p>

<p>

And so our team has returned from the Centex Ultimate Tournament in
Austin,
flushed with...uh...defeat. The Saturday Night Specials have now been
renamed
the Saturday Night Special Olympics, and our entry fee was picked up by
our
"opponents" (though that word implies a reasonably even contest) who
were glad
to earn cheap victories at our expense. We lost three on Saturday and
then
another in single-elimination in the consolation (read: "losers")
bracket on
Sunday. The scores: 17-3, 17-2, 17-9, and 13-9. The number of points
required
for a victory seemed kinda variable--last year, teams only had to rack
up 11
to beat us.
<p>
The first game day did not start auspiciously for me, as I had no sooner
arrived at the field than I locked my keys in my truck. I had to send
Cog back
to his sister-in-law's house to get that all-purpose tool, a coat
hangar,
which worked marvelously well and quickly popped the lock. (Mental
note: don't
leave valuable stuff in truck at Saturday night game.) However, all else
looked good, except Paul declined to show, having a foreboding of what
was to
come. But at least the weather was nice, unlike the arctic conditions
at the
previous tournament.
<p>
Our first match was against Old Yeller, a pack of 40-year-olds, the same
blokes that whipped us in our Tuesday At Four incarnation last year. I'm
pleased to report we tripled our point output over last year's match
against
them. We really had no hope against these guys, and we still hadn't
quite
figured out what to do or why we were on the field. At least they put
us out
of misery with swift efficiency. Afterwards, we suffered our first
casualty,
John, who stole my thunder and stormed off the field in a rage, never
to be
seen again. Luckily, some German guy named Brauer had joined us, so we
still
were able to have four people loitering on the sidelines for
substitutions. 
<p>
The next game was against some other team that had looked to us to be
really
good. Unfortunately, looks were not deceiving, and they thrashed us
mercilessly. Mark commemorated this debacle by puking all over the end
of the
field.
<p>
The third massacre was against a pack of deranged mutants that spent a
great
deal of their time milling about the sidelines, muttering "Nub nub, nub
nub."
This diabolical tactic worked all too well on me and filled me with
soul-
numbing fear. It also had some effect on Brick, who showed up to taunt
us, and
soon found himself also puking all over the end of the field. But we
had other
skills than projectile vomiting, and the game was at least reasonably
close
this time. Since we had lost so rapidly in our first two matches, we
were
well-rested, whereas the Nub-nubs had fought hard and had only enough
energy
to maul us badly with little finesse. 
<p>
I completed my awful day by going back to the Ramada Inn (filled with
surly
and incompetent employees whose loathing of us was scarcely concealed)
and
accidentally  smashing my head into the underside of a staircase.
Unhappily,
my plan to get a concussion to excuse myself from the Sunday game came
to
naught, and it was with great reluctance that I found myself at the
field the
following morning.

This time we faced the Hammerheads from Corpus Christi, and at last we
met a
foe worthy of us, which means a team that was filled with as many old,
fat,
and slow people as ours, and nearly as many complainers and whiners and
the
dreaded Makers of Bad Calls. At one point we nearly had to convene a
civil
court out there just to sort through the calls and countercalls, though
Cog
was correctly busted for his infamous "Cog shuffle" when he was a
thrower. The
worst moments were when Will blazed across the endzone we were
defending and
slapped away what would have been a score, only to get tripped up with
the
intended receiver, who seized advantage of the situation to call a
foul, even
though the disk was blocked before the contact and batted so far away
that it
was unplayable even without contact. Then the Hammerheads reacted with
outrage
when Tim skied up for a catch, got speared in the back, and called his
own
foul. It pretty much devolved after that point, with strips, fouls, out
of
bounds, and picks being called in a flurry. I think I even heard "dog on
field" being cried out. In any event, we had a real chance in this
game, and
afterwards everyone felt pretty damn good.
<p>
Items of note:
<p>
1) The team MVP was the canopy Tim bought for the Sunday game, so we
would no
longer broil in the sun. We were the envy of all and could've charged
admission to our shaded splendor. I think we've got the equipment angle
pretty
well taken care of; we knew enough this time to bring chairs and
sunblock
(though most of us were too dim-witted to realize that the sun would
shine on
our arms and legs and not just our faces, so consequently horrific
burns were
a common affliction). 
<p>
2) Our team name got printed on a Centex shirt available for a low, low
price.
We can now be associated in print with such giants as Club Mud and the
Hound
Dogs. 
<p>
3) Wonder Boy was totally macking out there and was rewarded with
several new
phone numbers from female admirers.
<p>
4) Brick came in for a single series and discovered it is difficult to
play if
one has spent the day gorging on candy bars and cookie dough and then
hits the
field wearing long pants. 
<p>
5) Cog's young children were exposed to the traumatic experience of
seeing
Daddy slapped silly by our opponents. I sense many years of expensive
psychotherapy in their futures. 
<p>
As for my own performance, it can be catalogued as shown below:
<p>
1) No one can deny that I was periodically on the field.
<p>
2) There is no number 2.
<p>
I certainly excelled in general pessimism ("We're all doomed", "We
suck",
etc.), whininess ("How come we don't get to play other losers just like
us?"),
petty backbiting ("Bill's the single greatest menace we've ever
known--to our
own team") and explosions of rage ("Bite me, Tim!"). I can only
recommend that
should I choose to play at Centex again, I be kept heavily medicated at
all
times. 
<p>
Be that as it may, I would like to blame--er, thank--Tim for the effort
he put
into organizing this, which was no small feat. Now, if he can arrange
regular
scrimmages for us against Club Mud, maybe we'll have a shot next year...
<p>
"Wa-hoo!" (the sound from the other team every time I touched the disk)
