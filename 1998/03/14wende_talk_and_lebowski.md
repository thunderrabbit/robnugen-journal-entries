Well, today I talked with Wende. I did not want her to move out, but simply wanted my emotional space to myself. I have asked her to be roommates with me. She had indicated that she cannot afford to live alone, especially as she is trying to save dollars for graduate school. So we will be roommates and she'll live in the living room as other roommates of mine have. I thankfully expect the everything to work out well. We looked at miniblinds for her today.

<b>Why</b> do I have my personal life on the Web?<br>
I don't know.

Then we saw <em>The Big Lebowski</em>, starring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and some other people. It wasn't as hilarious as <em>The Wedding Singer</em>, and it wasn't as confusing as a first viewing of <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, but it was kinda funny and kinda bizarre. I felt sorry for Dude, played by Jeff Bridges, but everything seemed to pretty much work out in the end.  </p>
