<title>Ring for people named Rob</title>

<p class=date>26 March 1998</p>

<p>

Today I decided I should join a ring for people named Rob.
<p>
I checked out <a href=http://www.webring.org>www.webring.org</a>
and I found rings for people named Susan, rings for people named Bob ("not Rob," it said, but Bob), rings for people named such and such and what-cha-who, but not for people named Rob.
<p>
I did find a ring named Rob's Ring.<br>
I checked it out and there were two sites: One for the owner, Rob, and one for his brother Mike.
<p>
That didn't exactly match what I had in mind, so I created the "Ring for people named Rob."
<p>
It turned out to be a bit more work than I first thought, but I believe I have everything under control. (but not perfect yet).
<p>
If you would like to join the Ring for people named Rob, I am thrilled!!  Click here to find out how.  (2003: ring doesn't exist)
