<title>Gymnastics and maybe a new new gym?</title>

<p class=date>Tuesday 31 March 1998</p>

<p>
Today in gymnastics, I did back handsprings again, and my standing ones were better than those I did last week!  (Plus I didn't rip my abs.)
<p>
I did some round off back handsprings, and they got better and better as I kept practicing and then they got crappy.  My arms forgot to land or they were all spread out or whatever.
<p>
Then I did one really good round off back handspring (really good for me) my arms were straight, though I landed in a crouched position of "am I alive? did I do it???"<br>
But it was straight and my arms were straight.
<p>
And then they got crappy again..  I couldn't even tell where my body was and aaaarrggggh!!!  I did some great standing ones, but my round off ones were dumb.
<p>
After class, I talked with Lindsey and her mom.  Lindsey is having the same problem I am: good standing back handsprings, but crappy round off back handsprings.
<p>
They told me about a gym out in Katy that has a much bigger better program than this one.  I may go check it out at 4:30pm this Sunday.</p>
