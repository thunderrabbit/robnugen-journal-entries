<p>Happy Birthday Tammy!  Happy Birthday Wendy!

<p>The excitement exhibited in the above wishes is forced. I am scared.

<p>I'm leaving for Costa Rica in 6 hours.  I'm nervous as hell.  I have just recognized this feeling a few minutes ago as I'm sitting here writing email, sending the Feel Good Net, updating my site, I thinking, um.. hey <em>I haven't packed yet.</em>

<p>Close my eyes, .. what's the deal?  (No pun intended (inside joke)) My stomach has butterflies, I feel like hurling; I feel like crying.

<p>I just cried.  I feel better, but my stomach still has butterflies.

<p>I'm going to start packing now.

<p>See ya in 8 days.
