<title>My trip to Costa Rica!</title>

<p class=date>Friday 27 November 1998</p>

<p>I have begun a new directory for my trip to Costa Rica.
At this point, it's only a tiny outline. I'll write more after I get my pictures back from Walgreen's, and have a sense of what I can scan.

<p>I'll write another entry in this general journal section when I'm completed with everything, or if you want to watch the progress, click
<a href="/travel/costa_rica/1998/index.html">here</a>.</p>
