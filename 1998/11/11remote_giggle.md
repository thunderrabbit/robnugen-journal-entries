<title>remote control and remote giggle</title>

<p class=date>5:35pm Wednesday 11 November 1998</p>

<p>Today I woke up way late - I cuddled tightly under the warm covers until 11am; I had been up until 4:30, and I was surprised that it felt like I was sleeping in..  well, I was, but it was only 6.5 hours.  Nevermind.

<p>Soon as I woke up, I was all, "gotta go check that crazy GiggleCam!"  and "Gotta go make a remote control for my website!"

<p>No. I gotta go grocery shopping and stuff. So I did.

<p>Then I came back and checked that crazy GiggleCam and made the remote control.  Watching Chris (aka Giggle) through the camera mounted on top of her computer monitor reminded me a lot of The Truman Show, that Jim Carrey movie from some months ago.

<p>Hmmm.  How very odd.

<p>Making the remote control was surprisingly easy. I will decide tomorrow if I think it will actually be useful on my site, and if so, make it available from my front page.

<p>I also chatted with Jen in New Hampshire and Suzanne my ex-neighbor and 3.5 hours later I was all 'putered out.

<p>Time to skate.  So I did.
