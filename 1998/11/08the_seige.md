<title>The Seige</title>

<p class=date>8 November 1998</p>

<p>After church today, on a total whim, Wende and I saw <em>The Seige</em>, starring Denzel Washington, Annette Benning, Bruce Willis, and some other guy whose name I cannot remember.

<p>The whole idea that <em>that</em> could happen was really scary to me. Seeing Brooklyn under martial law made me think damn I am glad to be free. Emotion and tears ripped through me to see the concetration camp that was created. It was nuts.

<p>Denzel's character was tough and believable, although his face seemed to heal quite quickly after one particular incident.

<p>Bruce Willis played the super patriotic, testosterone driven general and it was the first role I'd seen him in where I thought, "grrrr" at his character.

<p>The scene that is shown in the previews with Bruce yelling at Denzel, "<b>RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, I <em>AM</em> THE LAW!!!</b>" 
put me in a death-grip on Wende's hand.

<p>'twas a good movie. I'm glad it was only a movie.
