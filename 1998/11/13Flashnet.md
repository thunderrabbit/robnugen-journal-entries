<title>Flashnet</title>

<p class=date>12:34 am Friday 13 November 1998</p>

<p>Back in about May, I signed up with <a href="http://www.flash.net">FlashNet</a> as my ISP.  I have absolutely loved their service and customer support.

<p>In about July or so, I became an Independent FlashNet Representative, which means I can sell FlashNet's internet service to people, and I even set up an <a href="http://www.mrlaboratories.com/flashnet/index.html">online</a> registration form.

<p>Since then, I have sold 4 accounts, just to my friends and family who happen to need internet access.

<p><em>Today</em>, I actually went to a FlashNet opportunity meeting, and met the CEO of the company, and wow! I was really impressed!

<p>This thing is so easy!

<p>"HI, (insert friend's name here). I just got started as an independent flashnet representative. If you know anyone who needs internet access, give them my number."

<p>It has been suggested that if I say that 100 times, 20 people will sign up, or know someone who signs up, and of those 20, 4 will want to become representatives too.

<p>Amazing!

<p>If you know anyone who needs internet access, send them to my 
<a href="http://www.mrlaboratories.com/flashnet/index.html">form</a>!

<p>This weekend I'm going to Tulsa, Oklahoma for a conference. It's not a rally, but I'll be going to workshops and doing leadership type stuff with some of the youth.

<p>And, while I'm there, I'll go visit my friend Delayna, who I haven't seen since like 1991 at the latest!!  She was a buddy of mine in YRUU, and I look forward to seeing her and her new baby!!

<p>Have a great great day, and I'll see you next weekend!

<p>(That's "see you" in the same way that radio DJs say "see you")
