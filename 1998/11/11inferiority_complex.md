<p>3:01 am Wednesday 11 November 1998

<p>Wow.

<p>I just checked my guestbook, which I call Rob's Guess Book, cause it's funny, and because it's anyone's guess who will sign it, and I was thrilled to see three new entries!

<p>So I surfed on over to one of the the site called <a href="https://www.gigglecam.com" target="giggle">www.gigglecam.com</a> (before you click, know that I would consider the site rated R, and it has links to NC-17 and above) and holy cow, my site is like nothin' compared to it!

<p>Now this is normally not a concern; I see hundreds of sites that are cooler than mine, with java applets and pop up windows and dancing images and frames and all kinds of stuff, but they are all professional sites with a big budget and whatever.

<p>This gigglecam site is, as far as I can tell, run by a husband and wife team, not for profit, and it's enormous!

<p>So now I ask myself: do I want such a big site?  With images everywhere and Comic Sans MS font and colors and everything, including a consistent audience so big that Chris can ask a random question and post 25+ answers the next day???

<p>I answer by quoting my brother out of context, "yes, no, I don't know!"

<p>I do see that they are using Microsoft Front Page to do their site and that clearly violates several of my values, but I sure love their site!

<p>I mean... grrr! I don't even know what I mean; I'm getting pretty tired.

<p>They've got not only frames, which I have used successfully, but even a remote control! I've seen that I can do that with JavaScript, but I've just not done it yet.

<p>So what is this *need* I have to do what they've done? To prove that "I can do it too"  ???  I don't know.

<p>Would my site benefit from a remote control thing? I dunno, but it might be cool. They have theirs as an option; not as an automatic pop-up window, so at least I could do that.

<p>Part of me wants to work on it now, and part of me is saying "go to bed."  But the part of me that says "do it now" also says, "hey if we go to bed now, we might not be inspired to do it tomorrow."

<p>"Tough. go to bed."

<p>okay.
