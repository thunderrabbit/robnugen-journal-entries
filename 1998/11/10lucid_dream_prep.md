<title>Preparation for lucid dreams</title>

<p class=date>6:05am Tuesday 10 November 1998</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks, Nikki and I have been chatting back and forth about god and other spiritual stuff, including astral and etheric projection.

<p>In the course of our conversations, Nikki said she writes down her dreams as soon as she wakes up, before those last fleeting glimpses vanish from her mind. Wow..  I've done that on occasion, but in the past haven't really kept up with it.  I'll make excuses like, "oh, I'll remember it," or "it takes too long to write them down."

<p>From her example, I am again inspired to do some dream journaling and to even take the time to create lucid dreams.

<p>I totally have the time to spend on such projects, and actually, I am a bit upset with myself for not spending more time since I've been intentionally not working.  Oh well. It's all good.

<p>My point? I woke up at 5am (via alarm in the middle of a dream cycle) and walked to the bank and post office (amidst a slight drizzle) to wake myself up mentally so I can go back to bed and be more likely to have lucid dreams.

<p>Good night.
