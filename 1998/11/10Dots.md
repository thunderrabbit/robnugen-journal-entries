<title>dots</title>

<p class=date>10 November 1998</p>

<p>Cool!

<p>I powered up my old PC:  486 33MhZ with 8 megs of ram, and was looking for a cool old file when I came across some of my old programs.  One is Dots, which I wrote in "The Spring of 1990" (as it says in the help menu) and I'm sure it was written in Pascal.

<p>"Dots?"

<p>To play, draw a grid of dots and each player takes turns drawing lines between adjacent dots either vertically or horizontally. When a player completes a square, that player gets a point and gets to go again.

<p>It's a fun simple little strategy game, but takes for damn ever to draw all the dots!  So I wrote a program to do it for me.

<p>I'm making the game available in my <a href="/downloads/">downloads</a> directory.

<p>If you grab it and enjoy it, please let me know!
