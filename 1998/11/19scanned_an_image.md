<title>I scanned an image!</title>

<p class=date>19 September 1998</p>

<p><img src="/images/rob/rob_fountain.jpg" align="left" alt="Rob in Phoenix 1993">

<p>Wow!  I finally was able to get Windows 95 going enough that I could scan an image!  The weird thing however, is that I can't get Windows to properly support my monitor.  It will only go to 640X480 pixels in 16 colors.

<p>10 years ago that woulda been great!

<p>But anyway, I scanned this image, uploaded it to my site, exited Windows, went to bed early (10pm), woke up (it's 5:34am), booted Linux, used GIMP (Gnu Image Manipulation Program) to adjust the color of the image, and re-uploaded it.

<p>And <i>bing</i> here's the result!  The scanner seemed to have some problem with streaking or something, but hey -- *I* can tell it's me!

<p>This picture was taken in August 1993 by Jeanette, my second cousin from Phoenix who attends school in Tucson.  We were at the Phoenix airport and I felt rushed to get onto the plane on time and I was all, "oh Jeanette hurry!" but she made me pose by the fountain.

<p>I made it to the plane on time.  I love the picture.  :-)  Hugs to Jeanette for encouraging me to take a moment.

<p>(now I gotta find her email address!)

<p>So yes, I may soon upload some more images that I've been
promising..  I certainly look forward to making the process a bit
shorter.  Maybe I can get Thomas to figure out why my monitor drivers
won't work.</p>
