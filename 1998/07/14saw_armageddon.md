<title>Armageddon</title>

<p class=date>14 July  1998</p>

<p>Today I went to see <em>Armageddon</em> with Emilio, who I used to work with at the outpatient pharmacy at St Joseph Hospital.

<p>The movie was pretty cool, except for the blatant physics errors, just like in <em>Deep Impact</em>.

<p>For example, the asteroid's mass was apparently sufficient to affect a 1 g attraction on everything.

<p>On the cool technical effects side, they blew up a famous city.

<p>My favorite favorite scene was near the end. The flickering superimposed images grabbed my emotions and I cried and cried.
<br>(does that give away too much?)

<p>If you can look past the physics errors, go check it out.  Lots of action and good special effects.  The characters were well developed and though the ending was predictable, it was still a tear jerker for me.
