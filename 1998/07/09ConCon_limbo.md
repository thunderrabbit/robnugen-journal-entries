<title>ConCon?</title>

<p class=date>9 July 1998</p>

<p>Yesterday I found out why my ConCon status was not determined.  They were waiting for a $75 check for my deposit!  Holy cow... so I sent that today and will find out hopefully soon if I make it.. A woman named Anne said there are "a few advisor positions open" or something like that.  Yipes!    

<p>So I released the outcome to the stars and will go to ConCon if they say yes, otherwise I'll go to Opus!

<p>my life has been opening up in a most lovely manner lately.  I'm so totally enjoying not having to work.
