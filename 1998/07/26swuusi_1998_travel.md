<title>SWUUSI</title>

<p class=date>am Sunday 26 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>After saying HI and bye to Amanda, and being up on my computer
I went to bed at 4am and slept 30 minutes until Wende called. During that sleep I experienced my soul perfectly existing in this continuous moment.  Beautiful.

<p>Wende said she was coming right over and she finally came over so very much later than I wanted and she wanted me to take some boxes to my back porch to be recycled and I ran to do it so as to not be late and holy shit I lost my toe ring.
<br>Sadness sadness anger sadness <em>why my toe ring that I've had for such a short time??</em> Fuck!

<p>Andger at Wende for being late subsided by the time we got to pick up Bix and Cathy from Spring High School at 6:10am.  I slept uncomfortably in the front seat at first on the way up, and then drove from just past Centerville the rest of the way... 29 miles into Oklahoma.

<p>We were not particularly super talkative on the way up, which was surprising to me, but I think it's because it was so durn early.  Wende's truck thermometer showed 107 degrees F.

<p>We stopped at Braum's along the way and I got a glass of water, a glass of orange juice, and a vanilla shake.

<p>So here we are and the camp is quiet as only a few people have arrived.  And it's hot.
