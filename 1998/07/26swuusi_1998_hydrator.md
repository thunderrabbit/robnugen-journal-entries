<title>SWUUSI</title>

<p class=date>6:45pm Sunday 26 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>I am the Head Hydrator.  I got the job after taking it upon myself to hand people glasses of water with a simple smile and, "drink this."  I like the job because the youth really appreciate it when I give them water even before they realize how much they want it.  Or before they can work up the energy to get up in this heat and get it for themselves.

<p>We have two big 5 gallon water cooler things, and they get refilled about once per hour.

<p>Before most people came, I walked around the camp to get a sense of the layout and to greet the youth on SWUUSI staff. I rode around in the back of Adam's truck on top of a pile of matresses as Adam and Kris did a bed shuffle to get correct number of beds into the correct cabins.

<p>The youth and other advisors arrived amidst flurries of happy hugs for old friends and welcoming greetings to our new youth. I am (as usual) working carefully to remember or learn all the first and last names of the youth.

<p>The community is delightful and about to eat dinner. I've been wearing my soaking wet PakTowel around and over my head. Despite the heat, the general mood is happy and excited about the upcoming week.
