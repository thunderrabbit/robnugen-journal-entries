<title>SWUUSI</title>

<p class=date>3am Friday 31 July 1998</p>
<br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>I got super hugs when I went back to the main cabin after "my first shower since Sunday morning!" "Yay Rob!" and hugs all around.

<p>Played koosh with Clark, Jessica, Nathan Sexton, and Bryn and others before dinner.  Gave advisors Mary Angel and Dorian back massages and then it was time for worship.

<p>I had been asked to lead a senior circle through some type of guided mediation. I wrote down the words to the 1996 OKC Rally song and started my part of the worship by singing it.

<p><font size=-1>to the tune of <em>A few of my favorite things</em></font>

<p>Boogers on buttcracks and dead charred wet monkeys
<br>Gabe with Guy Parkhurst make talent shows funky
<br>Cannibal inbreds with crack pipes and beer
<br>These are what made OKC Rally dear

<p>Sardines for hours and football for longer
<br>Talkin' and chillin' make friendships all stronger
<br>Walking to Rest and the bombed building here
<br>These are what made OKC Rally dear

<p>chorus:
<br>When the coffee's gone
<br>When the rally ends
<br>When you're feelin' sad
<br>Just you remember your OKC friends
<br>And then you'll start feelin' rad!

<p>Bonding with old friends and learning some new names
<br>Bluejean adornment and cheap corny mind games
<br>Special Ed tunes that we all love to hear
<br>These are what made OKC Rally dear

<p>(chorus)

<p>Then I was all, "each rally has its song, but the songs just weren't written.." I reminded them of various memorable events that have happened at rallies in the past few years, bringing laughter and good memories to the group.

<p>I described how life will be different after YRUU but there are young adult groups "throughout the continent... Canada" I added that on for Anna and they knew.

<p>I had them call into the circle the names of some youth who have graduated before them.. any youth that has touched them in some way.. and they did.

<p>I encouraged them to feel the tightness and safety of the container, and to know it is always available- just a phone call or email or snail mail away.

<p>Then Bix had the rest of the group give a giant big group hug and all was good and all were chillin' and then they yelled Bish Bish.

<p>Bish Bish is the name of a chant of profanities often saved for highly emotional moments such as this. I personally find nothing wrong with it, but I know some people have different ideas about what language is appropriate... especially screamed outside after 1 am.

<p>We walked back without incident and most everyone assembled for the talent show. Kris and Aaron were up on stage and Steve hopped up there and stopped the show.  "Okay, we need to have a meeting. Get everyone in here and let's meet."

<p>Basically he said the youth broke the rule previously set about maintaining quiet hours after 11pm and he wanted to know how to keep that rule from being broken again.

<p>For 1.5 or 2 hours the group deliberated on the appropriate course of action. Down down down the sleepy tubes went the conversation, but in the end the youth made clear decisions about what they would do to rectify the current situation and keep it from happening again, and to stop any problems that result later from this particular instance.

<p>At the end, Drake complimented our process and suggested only that we send about 3 youth to be trained as facilitators so this kind of discussion can go more smoothly in the future.

<p>I was too sleepy to stay up for the talent show after that, and in retrospect, I wish I had. On the way back, Jeremy said the senior circle that I led was fabulous and he and Nathan wanted to be sure I knew the fault was in no way mine.  I appreciated his words.
