<title>SWUUSI</title>

<p class=date>11pm Sunday 26 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>After dinner I watched youth swim, but I didn't swim at first since I hadn't brought my swim trunks to the lake. (it was a 7 minute walk each direction from the camp to the lake)

<p>I went and got my trunks and Jason Fricke and I had fun wrestling and goofing around in the water.  At one point we were standing back to back with our arms interlocked and trying to essentially do flips while staying in this position.  We were able to do it a few times, and that was cool.   <br>Then the funniest thing (funny to me; Jason thought it was funny, but thought my reaction was funnier) was when we were doing a flip and our backs squirted air from between them in a perfect farting sound and I collapsed with laughter into the water.
<br>Jason was all poking fun at me and I couldn't stop laughing. 
<p>That was so hilarious.  We laffed and laffed and had a great time. He jumped off my shoulders a couple of times.

<p>then Jessica got on my shoulders and jumped where it was too shallow and I cringed and then she came up out of the water holding her head. "Ow," she plaintively, and my brain fell apart.
She had landed basically straight exactly head first and crunched her neck. I helped her to shallower water and held her, soothed her, carefully keeping appropriate advisor boundaries. I didn't think to have Wende or someone zip back up to the main camp to get help. Jason made jokes to help cope but had to stop because Jessica couldn't laugh because it hurt her neck.

<p>Finally she was able to stand and get out of the water and she sat with Wende and I zipped back to the main camp and got Arlene (acting as nurse) who drove her car to get Jessica.  Because Jessica could walk, and could move her neck, we simply put ice on it and sent her to bed.

<p>(She was all better by morning.)
