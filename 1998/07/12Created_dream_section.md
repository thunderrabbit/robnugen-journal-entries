<title>Dreams</title>

<p class=date>5:45am Sunday 12 July 1998</p>

<p>"Yesterday" when I was sleeping outside I woke up around 4am and wrote down a dream and thought "I should create a section of my webpage devoted to dreams"

<p>I came up with a 'lucidity scale' and stuff, too.

<p>This morning I woke up at 4:30 and wrote down another dream. This one I have transcribed onto my website and called "Life Spans" and will likely make a copy of it available in my Gravity section.

<p>I found that I already had some dreams mixed in here with my
journal entries.  After much deliberation, I have decided to move them
to my dream section, which is at www.geocities.com/~thunderrabbit/dreams/1998.

<p class=note>july 2003: that site is long gone, but the dreams are <a
