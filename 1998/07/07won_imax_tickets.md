<title>Won IMax Tickets</title>

<p class=date>7 July 1998</p>

<p>Today I was driving to the Lodge to work listening to Sam Malone and the morning show on the radio.  Sam started talking about people who named their cars, and I <b>knew</b> they would talk calls on the subject.

<p>So I called from my car, Scott, and Chuck answered the phone, "KRBE"

<p>"Hey this is Rob!  I have a car named Scott!"

<p>"Scott?" he confirmed.  "Hang on," and he put me on hold.

<p>Then I heard Sam on the radio (and over the hold "music" on the phone), "oh, we're taking calls on this?"

<p><blockquote>Understand that Chuck frequently talks to Sam through Sam's headset so the audience can't hear it, except for Sam's response.
So Sam was responding essentially to <b>my</b> call!  Wheee!
</blockquote>

<p>Then <em>bing</em> Sam picked up the line, "KRBE how ya doing?"

<p>"Hey Sam!  This is Rob and I'm driving my car named Scott!  He's a 91 Toyota Camry from Sterling McCall Toyota!"

<p>(The morning show often plugs Sterling McCall) Maria responded, "way to get that plug in there!"

<p>Then I interrupted, "but better than a plug, I've got a song!"

<p>"Let's hear it!"

<pre>
"Oh Scottie, you're my favorite car.
Wherever we go, yeah, there you are!
Oh Scottie, I love you so much,
Cause you're the kinda car that has a clutch!"
</pre>

<p>Maria yelled, "that's great!"

<p>Psycho Robbie goes, "wow!"

<p>Sam goes, "give this guy some tickets!"

<p>And <em>bing</em> I was back on hold again and listening to the next call.

<p>"HI what's your name and your car's name?"

<p>"blah blah blah blah"

<p>"Do you have a song for your car?"

<p>"nope"

<p>"Oh well, hey thanks for calling"

<p>And then Chuck came back on the line. "Hey would you like 4 tickets to the IMax this Friday night?"

<p>"heck yeah!"

<p>And that's how I won tickets to the IMax for a song.
