<title>My day</title>

<p class=date>23:59 Wednesday 22 July 1998</p>

<p>Today I was super productive.

<p>I made the final touches on and printed my advertisements that will help spread the word that I can do HTML work and webpage stuff for people.  (spread the word!)

<p>Then I spent a few hours at the Lodge creating a lovely report in our Access database and almost finished that.

<p>Then I went home for a nap and got a call from a man looking to be signed up as a FlashNet customer!  I was super pleased and happily surprised!  He had seen my name on FlashNet's site and gave me a call.  

<p>Totally awesome except for one detail; I had never signed anyone up before, I've never been trained, and I was like, "yipes!!!"  But I figured it out how to sign people up online and it was all good.

<p>Then Manda came over and we had a Jam Session.  A Jam Session is where we each figure out what our goals are for the next week or so, trade lists, and act as cheerleaders for the other to help them keep on track!  This has certainly kept me more productive and I certainly appreciate the support!

<p>(Although many people have certainly used this technique to help get stuff done, I feel obligated to cite Barbara Sher's book <em>WishCraft: How to get what you Really Want</em> which is where I first read about Jam Sessions.

<p>Then off to Denise's house with Wende and youth from church for a bar-b-cue dinner and meeting with Ann Fox, who just got back from Transylvania and had all variety of stories for us!

<p>After that I dropped Wende off at home and cruised to a tattoo parlour called The Celtic Oddessey to find Christine, but she had already gotten her tattoo and left.  So I paged her and went to Bookstop to read while waiting for her to return my page.

<p>At Bookstop I searched for <em>Conversations With God, Book Two</em> by Neale Donald Walsch, but they didn't have it in stock.  So I read a book called <em>Idiot's Guide to the Titanic</em>.  

<p>Christine never called me back.

<p>I grabbed an ice cream sandwich on the way home and munched and wrote this entry.
