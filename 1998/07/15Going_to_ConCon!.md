<title>Con Con confirmation</title>

<pre>15 July 1998

Hi Rob,

This is just to let you know that you will be going to Con Con this
year after all.  I have now put a confirmation letter and travel form
in today's mail and you should receive it soon.  The travel form was
supposed to have been mailed back to me by July 13.  But not to worry.
If you have access to a fax machine, could you please fax the form to
my attention after you complete it and then mail me the hard copy. Or
just drop the form in the mail to me at your earliest convenience if
you can't fax it.  As long as I get the completed form in the next two
weeks, everything will be cool.  You will also receive a pre-packet in
the mail in the next week or so.  No pre-packets have gone out yet to
anyone else coming to Con Con but we are working very hard to finish
the pre-packet and get it mailed off to everyone by this Friday at the
latest.
