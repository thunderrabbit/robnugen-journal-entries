<title>Windows 98</title>

<p class=date>20 July 1998</p>

<p>Well, I haven't heard from Thomas to help me get Windows 98 off of my machine here, so I decided to use it.  I got my connection to Flashnet going easily enough, and got Netscape Communicator configured, but I have no frikkin' idea what Windows Messaging means by my "post office"

<p>"Please enter the path to your post office," it says.

<p>What?  What the hell are you talking about?  Is there a post office on my PC?  Is it mail.flash.net?  What do you mean?  

<p>argh.

<p>So I cannot as of yet read my mail, but don't worry; I will keep working on this.

<p>I did find that my C: drive appears to be intact.  All the shortcuts are still in the C:\Windows\Desktop directory, and I just copied them over to my Win98 desktop.  Most of them didn't work though; they are looking for some DLL or another.

<p>So I can't work on my budget or me snail mail database or anything interesting.  But I can access the web.

<p>"So what, Rob," you may ask, "do you think of Windows 98?"

<p>Well, it just looks like a cute-i-fied version of Win95.  The opening screen is flashier.  You can single click on icons to open them.  Windows Explorer looks like Internet Explorer. 

<p>But it sure as hell isn't any easier to set up than Win95. What's a post office?  Why did you eat my Win95 partition? Where's this super fast speed you were talking about?

<p>I'm unimpressed with how much Win98 has advertising everywhere.  Not like commercials on TV, but practically so with this new "Channel Guide" thing and the few specific ISPs that are suggested when I first tried to set up my ISP...

<p>But, it's only been 1 day; we'll see how I feel about it tomorrow.
