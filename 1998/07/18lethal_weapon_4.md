<title>Lethal Weapon 4</title>

<p class=date>4:30pm Saturday 18 July 1998</p>
<br><font size=-1>movie started at 4:30</font>

<p>Wende and I saw Lethal Weapon 4, and it was really good.

<p>I was quite impressed with the script and scenarios and stuff.  It was only predictable in that the good guys didn't die.  Otherwise it kept me riveted and laughing.

<p>Wende gripped my hand so tightly that her fingers fell asleep.
"I certainly had to flex them to get feeling back into them," she said.

<p>The movie was great, especially for a #4 in a series.  Wow!!

<p>After the movie, we had a great heart-to-heart discussion for 2.25 hours about us and life and ourselves and goals and fears and relationships and stuff.  I feel greatly honored that Wende and I can talk about these things, even though it is difficult.

<p>At one point, I cried during our conversation, when describing my fears that quitting my job was the wrong thing to do and that I would not be able to make enough money otherwise.
<br>I am pleased that I can cry when I need to.
