<title>Bought new printer</title>

<p class=date>21 July 1998</p>

<p>Today I purchased a new printer.  It's a Canon BJC-4300. Prints black & white and color (without changing cartridges) up to 5 pages per minute b/w um,..  760 x 760 dpi and can be converted into a 360dpi scanner if I but some other attachment thing.  Hmmm.  $179 + tax from Office Max.

<p>So I'm still using Windows 98. I have decided that Win98 was installed on D:\Windows like I asked, but overwrote the boot partition on C:  so when I tell the LILO prompt to boot Win95, it goes to the C: boot partition and it says D:\Windows which is Win98.  Makes sense, but I'd still like to fix it.

<p>Today at the laundry mat Lynda White walked in!  Oh my god I haven't seen her in 7 years!  We went to Tomball High School together, graduating in 1988.  How totally freaky!
<br>We saw each other and did a double take and I said, "holy shit," and she said, "hi Rob," like it was nothin'.

<p>Then big big big big big hugs and traded phone numbers and stuff.  She lives 1 mile away from me.. has been there for a year now.  Wow!!!!

<p>I still can't check my email that may be on my flashnet account.  (Can you tell me what the post office is????)   

<p>I gotta split for gymnastics!  (pun intended!)  see ya!
