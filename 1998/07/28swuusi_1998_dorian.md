<title>SWUUSI</title>

<p class=date>11pm Tuesday 28 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>During Sean's Hair and Foot Washing Workshop, I got my hair washed by Anna Magwood and Katy Robinson and my feet washed by Josh Voyles.  The nurturing attention was wonderful.

<p>I was pretty well sunburned today with all my time spent at the lake, even though I started the day with SPF 50. Maybe it wasn't as waterproof as I hoped.

<p>Inside I made a yarn noodle thing that looked somewhat like a chinese finger trap, but didn't really work as one.  Then dinner of nachos and lots of cheese.

<p>Then went swimming again for about 2+ hours.  As it began to get dark outside, I herded the youth toward shore. I was just about to send them out of the water (youth had made a rule that there had to be two advisors for anyone to swim at night) when a flashlight came walking down toward the beach.

<p>"Are you an advisor???" yelled about 1/2 the youth.

<p>"Yeah."  It was Dorian.

<p>"Yayyayaayyayayay!!!! and they broke the invisible barrier past me toward deeper water. 

<p>I commented something to Dorian like, "look how popular you are!"

<p>We talked and listened and affirmed one another around our various life issues. I told her about Warrior stuff and how my dad and I have had a much fuller relationship since our work together in that organization. She certainly understood since she had been super close with Karen while Karen was in YRUU.

<p>Now I'm back at the main cabin writing this.  Worship soon at the lake and then I rove from midnight to 4am.

<p>4:30am Wednesday 29 July 1998

<p>Worship = circle hug everyone else and then a Sufi chant/dance and then verbal kudos about the week so far.

<p>Roved with no worries then said HI to Kris and Aaron. Now bed.
