<title>lock-in and beach cleanup</title>

<p class=date>Saturday 18 July 1998</p>

<p>Last night Wende and I went to the Post GA Participant Party and it was cool.  10 of us were there, and I felt a nice balance between talkative and listenative.

<p>When we left the weather was storming and I came home and turned off my PC in case the power went out.  Then I cruised to the youth lock-in at First Church.

<p>I got there around 10pm and the youth were being fairly rambunctious, but still not too crazy.  We watched <em>Father of the Bride II</em> then they were super wild and rambuncitous, throwing balls in a team keep-away game and wrestling and general running around.

<p>Once they wore themselves out, we organized (with some difficulty) a "fishbowl" .. designed to help the youth bond.

<p><blockquote>(the way we wanted it to work was have everyone write a question that each individual in the group would answer out loud to the group.  They wrote the questions okay, but we could not get everyone to respect those who were talking and to not talk while others were answering the questions.)</blockquote>

<p>By the end it was 4:30 in the morning and I went to sleep for 2 hours before Adam and I left for the beach cleanup at 7pm.

<p>Benjamin, a young adult who I met at GA showed up at the church at 6:45am to join us to the beach.

<p>I woke up Adam and we vacated to group up at Thoreau Congregation to caravan to Galveston Island State Park, where we were to clean up.

<p>Got to Thoreau at 7:31am and got to the Park at 9am and got some garbage bags from the park ranger and we were on our way!

<p>Most of the youth took the full-tilt-go-grab-big-trash-stuff
technique while I and a couple other adults took the walk-slowly-precision-pick-up-stuff technique.

<p>Both techniques worked well.

<p>During the cleanup, I found some well worn pieces of glass bottles that had been broken but were no longer sharp. sand..glass.. makes sense, right?  right.
<br>so anyway, I decided to collect all the broken though smooth pieces of glass I found and make a stained glass window out of them.  I now have a bag essentially full of smooth broken glass.

<p>I collected about 1 trashbag worth of stuff and then took a wade with Wende, Shawn & Amy, and then I took a nap.

<p>Drove home and chilled for like 1 hour and then Wende and I went to see <em>Lethal Weapon 4<em>.
