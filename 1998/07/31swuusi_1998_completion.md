<title>SWUUSI</title>

<p class=date>12:13pm Friday 31 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>Welp, we're on the way back home from SWUUSI. I was kinda in a grouchy mood when I woke up this morning after missing the talent show last night. Fricke et.al. had written a song for SWUUSI and fuck I missed it and they are graduating. 

<p>But I felt way better with all the love and hugs and happy happy joy joy throughout the camp, and signing mugbooks and taking pictures and all the fun.

<p>We had closing circle and the seniors, instead of screaming Bish Bish again, busted out with

<p>ROW ROW ROW YOUR BOAT!
<br>GENTLY DOWN THE STREAM!
<br>MERRILY MERRILY MERRILY MERRILY!
<br>LIFE IS BUT A DREAM!!!

<p>and it was so funny after the conversation last night!
I sense a new tradition happening soon.

<p>I also got great kudos from Nathan about my ad lib worship last night for the seniors. They really liked my work and I feel great!

<p>On the way home the funniest thing was Wende asking Nick, a vegan, "okay, do you want to go to Pit Bar-B-Q or Jake's Steaks for lunch??"

<p>She drove most of the way home and then I drove from just past Centerville the rest of the way in.
