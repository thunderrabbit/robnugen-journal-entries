<title>Almost did layouts!</title>

<p class=date>14 July 1998</p>

<p>Today after seeing Armageddon, but before gymnastics, I stopped by Smoothie King to get a smoothie.  I told the guy they should have a smoothie flavor called "groovy juice."

<p>"Groovy juice, eh?"

<p>"Yeah.. let me tell you what's in it."  I looked up at the ingredients list. "Um, wheat germ, bananas, soy protein, turbinado and honey."

<p>"That's it?"

<p>"Yeah.  This time."

<p>"do you want any fruit juices?"

<p>"whaddya got?"

<p>He rattled them off and I chose mango.

<p>I paid the cashier dude and the other guy handed me the smoothie.  "Here's your groovy juice."

<p>"Thanks!"  The weird thing is that I didn't even notice until after I left that he called it groovy juice!

<p>I slurped it down on the way to gymnastics, and I was so so so super energetic there!

<p>I stretched and chatted and we did the small tumbling passes: handstands, then cartwheels, then roundoffs..  And then I did round-off flips that were essentially pike position, but not layed out.

<p>BB encouraged me and gave me pointers and I kept going and going and the flips kept getting better and closer to layouts!
I was so energetic and kept going even while several of the others in line began to sit out a turn.

<p>Eating before gymnastics helps so much!!!!

<p>At about 5 minutes before time to go, I went to the big trampoline and did flips and flips and flips and was pretty much able to jump, flip and land at the same point on the trampoline. That was cool.

<p>Said bye to everyone and here I am!
