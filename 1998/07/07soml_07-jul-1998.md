<title>State of My Life Address</title>

<p class=date>7 July 1998</p>

<h1>State of My Life</h1>

<ol>

<p><li>Wow!  so so so so so MUCH has happened!</li>

<p><li>I quit my job.  I mentioned that already.</li>

<p><li>I'm busier now that I quit my job than I was before!</li>

<p><li>I got a flat tire on the way to the dentist.  That was an interesting story which just completed today.</li>

<p><li>I went to Rochester, New York for one week for a huge conference called General Assembly! (GA) It was amazing.</li>

<p><li>At GA, I decided to re-start The Feel Good Net</li>

<p><li>At GA, I met Leif Hardison, and soon after GA, we got <a href=http://www.yruu.org>yruu.org</a> set up.</li>

<p><li>After GA, Wende and two friends we met there drove to Niagra Falls.  Parked on the US side and walked to the Canadian side.  Amazing.</li>

<p><li>On our flight home from GA, the pilot swung by Niagra Falls, giving us a spectacular view from only 4000 feet in the air.  Truly awe inspiring.</li>

<p><li>Just today I signed up for health insurance as a self employed type person.</li>

<p><li>Also just today I signed up as a FlashNet distributor. If you want a dialup ISP, gimme a call!</li>

<p><li>I designed new business cards for myself.  They are cool because they're hand written.</li>

<p><li>This morning, I called in to the radio station and won four tickets to IMAX.  But you'd never guess how unless you heard me!</li>

<p><li>Look for all these stories and more coming soon to my journal entries!</li>
