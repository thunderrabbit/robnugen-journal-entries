<title>Catching Up</title>

<p class=date>Thursday 10 September 1998</p>

<p>Yes, I haven't written in a while.  Sigh..  Sometimes I feel so
bogged down and I have so much fun stuff to write!!  Tulsa Rally was
last weekend, dinner at Niko Niko's was last night, and I've had lots
of anti-fun with my scanner not working!

<p>But I'm here on campus at UH again; just ate lunch and said HI to Nikki and Sara and am about to go to Scholars' Community where I used to work on campus.    .. ..  I wonder if Tina is still workin' there.  I assume so.  :-)  Yay!

<p>I just had a theological conversation with Nikki, and the following questions came to my mind:

<p><ul>
<li>What do you think happens after we die?</li>
<li>What is sin?</li>
<li>Do you believe in heaven?</li>
<li>Is God male or female or neither?</li>
<li>Does God ever become angry?</li>
<li></li>
<li>What is the most important thing in life?</li>
<li>What are emotions?</li>
<li>Is there life on other planets?</li>
<li>Do mosquitoes have souls?</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe I'll address these in my Gravity section.  mail me your answers!
