<title>Pixels!</title>

<p class=date>30 September 1998</p>

<p>Things are going pretty great lately.

<p>Just last night, after 2 weeks of using my display at 640x480 pixels and 16 colors, Thomas was able to come over and fix it. I needed a PCIIX driver and a S3 Virge/DX driver and I just didn't have the expertise to get everything set.  But now it's 1024x768 and 24 bit color and it's great!!!

<p>I'm actually pleased with Windows right about now.

<p>I was able to easily scan pictures and maps and get some cash flow via <a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com">MR Laboratories</a>

<p>I don't know if I mentioned, but I opened a business account and my first check was to Office Max to purchase office supplies: pens, paper, envelopes, a ZIP disk rack, and file folders.
<br>My second check was to Carroll's used office furniture for a 3 drawer vertical filing cabinet.  Yay!

<p>I have moved my computer into my living room; it had been in my bedroom, and I love it.  Oh!  and that's a story in itself:

<p>I wanted to move my computer, but the phone line for the modem only reached to my bedroom. It hadn't been strung to the living room.  So I recognized I needed some phone wire and within 5 minutes, I heard the unmistakable warble of a telephone repair guy downstairs testing phone lines.

<p>Holy cow!  So I ran downstairs and described my delimma. He said he couldn't wire it for me, but he could give me 40 feet of phone line!  Fabulous!  So that night I connected the line to the jack in my bedroom, strung it outside between the bedroom and living room windows, and connected it to a jack in the living room.  Really.

<p>And it works perfectly!  I'm using it ri
