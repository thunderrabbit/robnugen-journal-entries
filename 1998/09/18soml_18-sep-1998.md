<title>State of My Life</title>

<p class=date>18 September 1998<br></p>

<p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>

<p>
<ol>
<li>It's currently 3:06am.  Why am I up so late?</li>
<li>I just uploaded two pages to my new domain <a href="http://www.mrlaboratories.com">www.MRLaboratories.com</a>! This site is for my webpage design business!</li>
<li>Spot, my cat, is curled up so very cutely in a small box beside me.. If I just had a camera!</li>
<li>Speakin' of cameras, I got a lotta pictures from when Houston flooded this past weekend!  I still intend to get some scanned and onto my site.</li>
<li>Oh yeah-- I have just recovered web access and stuff after my machine was down all last week.  I lost a 2.5 gig hard drive and <em>all</em> my email before like 9 September or so. Sigh.</li>
<li>Yipes! I haven't sent out a Feel Good Net in a while!</li>
<li>I'm going to Costa Rica in November!  I think I'm leaving on 18 November (Tammy's birthday) and coming back on 26 November. I'll be meeting my friend Kathryn (from California) there. I am totally excited about this trip!</li>
<li>I'm off to bed...  3:13am.  Good night.</li>

</ol>
