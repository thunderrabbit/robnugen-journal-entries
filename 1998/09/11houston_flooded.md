<title>Houston Flooded</title>

<p class=date>21:31 Friday 11 September 1998</p>

<p>Today started last night for me.  Manda came over and we talked and chilled and she had brought some Japanese crab burritos or something like that:  Crab, celery, rice, all rolled into a burrito shape with seaweed as the wrapper.  Good stuff.  She ate them mostly with soy sauce, I ate them mostly plain.

<p>Then she showed me the green stuff that came with the meal.  Looks kinda like play-doh.  A bit squishier.. maybe like hummus.

<p>But play-doh is salty, and hummus tastes a bit tangy.  This green stuff was hot.

<p>Oh yes! I recognized Lucian had a tube of this at Con Con!  Like a toothpaste tube, but I wouldn't try brushing my teeth with it. I took a splot of it on my finger.

<p>"This is for Lucian," and smeared it fully onto my tongue and squished it around my mouth <i>ohmygod</i>.  I closed my eyes and zoned on the sensation.  

<p>Tears poured out my eyes. If I breathed wrong, the vapor sizzled my nose... WOW.  To a dull burning the feeling chilled and then began to subside.  I squished the saliva around my mouth and swallowed it all down.

<p>Yeah.

<p>Manda was wide eyed like, "wow."

<p>We finished the burrito things (what <i>are</i> they called?) and at the end the green goop was left.  I smooshed it around with the chopsticks and tasted the hot residue on the sticks.  Hmm.  Again?

<p>Some twisted part of me said "yes" even though Manda was all, "'stotally up to you."  I got a bigger blob than Lucian had done at Con Con. I pondered it..  It only took 10 minutes last time; this couldn't take more than 15.  Smeared it on my tongue and onto the roof of my mouth.

<p><i>sizzle</i> went my tongue.  <i>ha ha</i> went the green stuff.  <i>eeep</i> went the burning sensation through my nose.
My eyes cried and I meditated on the whole process again.  mmmmm

<p>damn that was hot. Even now as I type, 24 hours later, I can still feel my tongue is raw.  Crazy stuff.  Try it!

<p>But what happened all day today?  Houston flooded.  That's what I originally intended to write about.  See the next entry.
