<p>
I just had an incredible experience at Kathy Fey's.  She is my body work professional type person, using Cranio-Sachral balancing, Reiki (sp) and massage to keep my body happy.
<p>
I've been doing body work with her for a while and today she focused on my left hip. There's been a bit of nagging almost pain there and to determine what is the deal with it, we did a "dialogue."
<p>
I went to my meditation hill in my mind and sat gently there for a bit.  Then Kathy invited someone to help guide us with the process.  A woman in white walked up and when prompted, invited us to refer to her as Mother.
<p>
Kathy asked about the source of the injury and I visioned a stabbing downward from behind with a bayonette during a war. Someone stabbed me back there and I collapsed during the Civil War and I wasn't able to see my family and I felt so sad and cried and cried on her table.  I drug my body dragging my left leg and ended up in the woods, falling asleep at night and dying that night.
<p>
Kathy asked if I could see who had stabbed me and I saw his face, green hat and brown moustache and it was Forest! in a previous life who had stabbed me.  Before I recognized him I forgave him and was really surprised when I saw who it was.  I explained to Kathy how I know him this lifetime.
<p>
We called to the hill anyone that I wronged during the war and about 7 or 12 men were there.  I felt I did not see their faces when I killed them as they were too far away.  I suspect I shot them.  I asked them all for forgiveness and was forgiven by some but not by all the men.
<p>
We let them go about their way and asked Mother if we could release the tension in my hip.  She said Yes but not as quickly as I would like.  We asked if there was anything else and she said she was so proud of me and my work.  I cried and cried again to hear that.  Wonderful
<p>
Mother had to leave so we thanked her and let her go.  We need only ask to have her return.
<p>
Wow.  I was amazed by the experience.  Part of me wants proof but I am currently content to believe it is precisely true.</p>
