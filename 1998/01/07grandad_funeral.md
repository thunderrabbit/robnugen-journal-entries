<p>
This has been a great evening.<br>
After the funeral and getting to ride in the limosuine, the most tear jerking thing was the bagpipes playing "Amazing Grace" as we left the church.  I almost cried.<br>
The burial ground was all sloppy muddy squishy cause it was raining just like at Monner's funeral.
<p>
We bummed around the Ockley house this night and ate and talked and Peter, Neil, Kim and I talked about chit chatty stuff and had a delightful time.  I greatly believe we cousins will begin to get together more often.
<p>
I showed everyone the genealogy I copied and gave Martin his copy and will copy more for others who want copies.
<p>
Finally we cousins left: Peter, Neil, Kim and I to get a VCR and movies and came to the hotel and we all congregated: me, Fred, Bridgette, Buddy, Matt, Peter, Neil & Kim to watch our crazy videos and <em>Pulp Fiction</em>.
<p>
We had a great time and really fun wrestling on the beds, talking about old times, and planning to meet again soon.
<p>
At one point, the following conversation happened:
<p>
Fred: "Yeah, but a bigger penis doesn't hurt."<br>
Bridgette: "Sometimes it does."<br>
(laughter)<br>
Rob: "Yeah- I hear that all the time."<br>
Bridgette: "I didn't need to hear that!"<br>
Fred: "<b>I</b> never tell you that."<br>
Rob: "That's 'cause you're used to Pete."<br>
Bridgette: "I <em>really</em> didn't need to hear that!!"
<p>
That was like 1am or so and we were really laffin crazy hard.
<p>
We determined the crazy fun videos span 4 years, but they are fully 10 years old!!!!!!!!!!<br>
We definitely need to get together more often.
<p>
As <em>Pulp Fiction</em> ended, it was 3am.  Matt and Buddy almost freaked (a lot or a little?) and were all "oh my god we can't wake up in only 5 hours!! blah blah blah" and Pete was all, "Aunt Jean told me not to let you stay up too late and I'll kick your ass if I get in trouble for you not waking up on time."
<p>
Pete and I laffed and gave each other five.  Heh heh.  Still the older cousins!  HA!!!</p>
