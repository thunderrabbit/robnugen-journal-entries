<title>Happy New Year Lock-in</title>

<p class=date>Happy New Year!!</p>

<p>
For the New Year's celebration, I went to a lock-in with the youth group, organized by Anna M.  Present were Dane D, Zach R, Jon W, Christina L, Andrew Z, Anna M, Jon M, Jim M, Christina M, Zola M, and me, Rob N.  (Sounds like the attendance list of a 12-step group!)
<p>
We had great fun setting of fire-crackers and oops one bottle rocket, but no roman candles, much to Jon W's chagrine.
<p>
We watched the Southpark episode with Kathie Lee Gifford (sp) and it was HIlarious.  Super great fun..  Not as hilarious was MAD TV, but I suffered through it.
<p>
Right now I am at <a href=http://www.LiquidLab.hypercon.com>Liquid Lab</a> which has ISDN internet connection for 5 bucks per hour.  Cool.  I've got ISDN at my apartment, but hey, I'm meeting a couple of people and dammit, if I'm <b>paying</b> to write, then I have much greater incentive to do so!!
<p>
Present here are: Sony (behind the counter), Kimberly (at a table), Tony (the owner).  Oh and me.   They have DJ Sun spin techno beats on Saturdays at 9:30 pm. Pretty cool.  Come check it out; I'll likely be here tomorrow.  Unless I'm scheduled already.
<p>
And that's it!  Have a super great day!
