<h1>1998 Houston rally review by Jason</h1>

<hr>

<p>

   I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I went to the bad ass flag
workshop. I
slept. I slept I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I
slept.
I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept.
I
slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I
slept.
I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept.
I
slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I
slept.
I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept.
I
slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I
slept.
I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept.
I
slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept. I slept and woke up, and
went home,
and slept.

<p>
              Moral of the story: If you are sick as fuck, you will
sleep
through the  rally like a shmuck.
