<title>General Assembly</title>

<h1>General Assembly</h1>

<p><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p class=date>11:30 AM Thursday 25 June 1998</p>

<p>Just went with Drake, Tera, Wende to the mall and Drake and I bought swim trunks for $10 each.  Met Jo Victoria! How cool to meet her after knowing her name from emails on YRUU-L mailing list!  Met youth Tim Wing and Stephanie something and Mandy Jacobson.

<p>Tim had rainbow colored cloth sections added to the pant legs of his pants, making what we call in Southwest District "Nancy Deardorff Pants"

<p>I walked barefoot to the mall and I'm thankful for Wende carrying my sandals.  Definitely having fun and looking forward to our bags arriving around 3pm.  My bag has my contact stuff and skates.

<p>I brought my skates!

<p>I connected with the young adults mostly today and hung out at their booth and helped color their sign and remet Justice Waidner (from Soutwest District) and David May and Riley McLaughlin (sp) and others.  Very few from SWD.

<p>Worship was cool.  I announced to the group that I quit my job and they clapped and a woman said she did the same thing in January.

<p>Went to the dance and got totally sweaty dancin' all crazy and remet Danita who I met at Fall Conference a few years back..  Saw Gregor Faron from Princeton and met Madeleine, who spells her name just like my aunt.  She was impressed at that.

<p>Got back to the room and wrestled with Wende and showered and am now going to bed.

<p>Good night.
