<P>Cc:  Service Manager at Fred Haas Toyota</P>

<P>HI</P>

<P>I apologize for the impersonal nature of this letter; I do not know your name.</P>

<P>I purchased my 1991 Toyota Camry around December 1997.  Since then I have had all work done on my car at Sterling McCall, until today when I got a flat tire on the north side of town.</P>

<P>Today I got a flat tire and when I changed it, I found one of the lugnuts extremely difficult to remove.  It had been cross-threaded.</P>

<P>I tried to put the small spare tire on, but couldn't get the lugnut to go back on correctly.  I saw that it had been cross-threaded and tried to put it on another bolt to see if that would help.  It did not help; I simply cross-threaded the other bolt. </P>

<P>So with 3 lugnuts on, I drove slowly to Discount Tire Company.  They fixed my tire but would not mount it on the car.  They said something like, &quot;those bolts are stripped, we don't want to break them, and can't replace them.&quot;</P>

<P>So I drove to Fred Haas Toyota to see if they could replace the faulty parts.  When I arrived, I told the service manager (whose name I have also forgotten) that the last work done on the front tires was at Sterling McCall Toyota and asked if he could replace the bolts at no charge.</P>

<P>He said he could not, and could not even &quot;work out a deal&quot; with Sterling McCall, and suggested that once the work was complete, I could take the stripped bolts to Sterling McCall as evidence.  </P>

<P>I chose not to drive all the way to Sterling McCall to have the work done; I did not feel safe driving with only three lugnuts.</P>

<P>I had the work done and paid $106.58 to Fred Haas.</P>

<P>The most recent time the front tires had been removed was at Sterling McCall on 3 June 1998, when I asked your shop to help with squeaky brakes.</P>

<P>My belief is that one lugnut was cross-threaded when it was mounted at Sterling McCall.  I clearly admit I stripped one other lugnut, but the main cost was not parts, but in the labor  ($82.43)</P>

<P>I want to remain a loyal customer of Sterling McCall, and I want to be reimbursed for at least 1/2 of my total cost, which would be $53.29.</P>

<P>I will be glad to bring in the stripped bolts if you want to see them</P>

<P>Thank you for your help.</P>
