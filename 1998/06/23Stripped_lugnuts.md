<title>Letter to Sterling McCall</title>

<p class=date>23 June 1998</p>

<p>Today on the way to the dentist, I hit something in the road and thought nothing of it.  Soon, however, I noticed my steering seemed really far out of alignment.

<p>I was talking to Manda on my carphone at the time.  "Hang on one second; this is bad enough that I'm going to pull over and look."  

<p>I pulled over.  I looked.  The right front tire was entirely flat.  "I'll call you back."

<p>I called Robin at the dentist's office and told her I would be late.  (I love having a cell phone!)

<p>While taking one of the lugnuts off, I found it was stripped.  Oh
crap. I was unable to get it back on, and had to cancel the dental
appointment and all that.

<p>The last people to mess with the lugnuts were in the service
department of Sterling McCall Toyota, so I wrote them a letter.

<p>On about 6 July, I got this <a href="/journal/1998/07/03sterling_response">response</a>.

<p>I was pleased I had written, and part of me thought, "you shoulda asked for more."  But overall, I think it's all good.
