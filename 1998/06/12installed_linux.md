<title>Installed Linux</title>

<p class=date>2:00am Friday 12 June 1998</p>

<p>Tonight after work, I began installing RedHat Linux v5.0 using the book <em>SAMS Teach Yourself Linux in 24 Hours</em>.

<p>The whole thing was so incredibly easy that.. wow.  I am really impressed and really pleased.

<p>It's actually only to the point that I can log in to my machine and choose between 6 different text terminals and run XWindows, but it sure is fresh.

<p>I look forward to being able to surf the web and stuff, and maybe, just maybe (hopefully!!!) getting The Feel Good Net happening again.   That will rule.

<p>Have a good night; I'm going to bed.

<p>oh wait.. Wende and I went to see the movie <em>Truman</em> starring Jim Carrey.  That's the one where he lives in a virtual world that literally revolves around him. 

<p>The concept was pretty wacky wild to my brain, and I enjoyed the idea.

<p>Carrey's character is not as insipid as some of the other roles he's played; I enjoyed seeing him fill well and more real, more complete person.
