<title>General Assembly</title>

<h1>General Assembly</h1>

<p class=date>24 June 1998</p>

<p>Wende and I were 40 minutes late flying out of Hobby Airport for Detroit. That wasn't so bad; I was in a great mood and not in a tremendous rush to get anywhere..  I was in vacation mode.  Whee!

<p>Got to Detroit at 1:15pm and easily made our connecting flight that was to leave at 1:45.

<p>Yup, we made the flight.  Sat in our seats.  

<p>There we were, waiting to take off..   anytime you're ready, Mr Captain.

<p>Okay..  we're all on the plane with our seat belts fastened.

<p>The flight was cancelled.  They couldn't get the air conditioning to work, and said therefore there would be not only no cool air, but no cabin pressure in the plane.  That would be bad.

<p>No plane was sent to replace the one we were on.. Just <b>"sorry"</b> and we were on our own.  

<p>I'll save you the pain... but we were at the airport for 8 hours.  I bought a Popular Science magazine and read about UFOs and other science stuff.

<p>Around 8pm I sat by a woman who spoke fluent Japanese and very little English.  She showed me the first 11 Japanese numbers from zero to ju, and how to write "thank you" and "Tokyo" (Toukiyou)
and it was quite a grand time.  I got her snail address and probably will write to her.
<br>I can write "thank you" and "tokyo" 11 times and number them!

<p><pre>11pm We got to Rochester.  finally.
No checked luggage though; it will
be delivered to the hotel in the morning

Talked to Drake Baer and turns out 
he also quit his professional job to pursue
youth advising.  It's great to see Tera and 
meet Joey Lyons.

It's 01:15 or so Thursday 25 June 1998.
Welcome to General Assembly.
