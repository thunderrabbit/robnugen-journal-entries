<p>Today in gymnastics I did some round off back flips on the floor and didn't really do them great but adequate.  I did at least flip over each time.  

<p>But I had more fun bouncin' on the big trampoline!  Jamie, who I met a couple of weeks ago and I were bouncing and just kinda goofin' around.  I showed him how I do front flips on my back to my back. He got a lot better at it while we played. I enjoyed being able to teach ... to analyze how I do it, and figure out how to break the motion into smaller bits.

<p>Coolest thing I saw tonight was Brittany doing double backs on the trampoline.  She had BB spotting her, but they were really clean and nicely done.  I can do double backs.  Maybe tomorrow.
