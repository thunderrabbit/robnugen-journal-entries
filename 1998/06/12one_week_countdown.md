<title>One Week Countdown</title>

<p class=date>11:45am Friday 12 June 1998</p>

<p>So here I am at work, chillin' like Bob Dylan with one week left here. ("I'm just chillin' like Bob Dylan" is from Beastie Boys' "3-Minute Rule" from <em>Paul's Boutique</em> CD. (find lyrics at <a href="https://www.lyrics.ch/query/get?s=5822" target="new_win">www.lyrics.ch</a>) It's my favorite quote lately.)

<p>So anyway, I'm here and have finished my current project and I have essentially nothing to do.  So I've been cleaning up my email inbox and forwarding to my personal account what messages I think I'll want to keep..  I'm listening to Beastie Boys right now (I was inspired by my top paragraph) and yeah.

<p>So, will I be bored when I quit?  Probably.  Well, maybe bored is the wrong word. I will have to learn to restructure my time and essentially figure out a time budget.  I will definitely have more time and more freedom and less security and yeah.

<p>I'm excited and I'm scared and I'll keep you informed through these journal entries.

<p>I'm greatly considering getting The Feel Good Net going again; I will definitely have the time to do it; I'll just need to move my mailing list off my old school account from University of Houston to my personal computer at home.

<p>I think I'll do that now.  Hang on.

<p>Wow..  it's now 14:26; I've been moving stuff off that account for 2+ hours.  Just mailing to my current account tons of messages.  I think I will create a new portion of this website: one for holding those messages that float around the internet.. I've got several and I think I'll start a tiny archive here on my site.
