<title>Babysitting</title>

<p class=date>Thursday 2 April 1998</p>
<p>
This morning Maggie and I worked from 2:30am to like, well it's 8:12am and we're still here, but we should be able to leave pretty soon..
<p>
Each morning of the second of the month, we get to stay up and babysit the batch jobs.
<p>
About this process Maggie says, "<em>We don't get much sleep, but we get to leave way early.  And you can wear the same clothes two days in a row and nobody knows but Rob.</em>"
<p>
We're going to do some errands and then watch cartoons after we get to leave.
