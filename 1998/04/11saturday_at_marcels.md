<title>Saturday at Marcel's</title>

<p class=date>Saturday 11 April 1998 (day before Easter)</p>
<p>
Today I went to Marcel's parents' house to chill for the day.
Mostly Marcel and I hung out the whole time, playing frisbee or shopping or inside with the family and Kayse and Adrien, plus Mimi's friend Caroline (?) who was in from Morocco.
<p>
'cel and I went to purchase a video tape and stopped to look at computer prices, just to see what's out there.
<p>
The current latest stuff at Computer City:
<table> <!-- to make the <hr> tag the right length -->
<tr><td>
<ul>
<li>266 Mhz Pentium II</li>
<li>6.4 Gig HD (didn't say SCSI or IDE)</li>
<li>64 Meg memory</li>
<li>24x CD Rom drive</li>
<li>56k internal modem</li>
<li>4 Megs memory on VGA card</li>
<li>sound card</li>
<hr>
<li>$1500 !!</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Oh, and ZIP drives (external, store 100megs on a disk) = $150 | Jaz (external 1 Gig) = $300 | Jaz (external 2 Gig) = $650
<p>
I looked because I'm in the market and I put it on my webpage for historical reference.  I was really impressed with what is available!
<p>
Anyway, we didn't find what we needed, so we drove toward Best Buy, but chose to drive through the parking lot instead of using the street and <em>bing</em> we got to the end of the lot and there was a railroad track between us and Best Buy!
<p>
Cool!  So we walked around on the tracks and spent several minutes analyzing how the electric current works around the switch. As total nerds, we had a great time, and you probably wouldn't understand.
<p>
After shopping, Marcel joked as we walked out of the brush back toward the car, "a cop sees us walking out of the bushes to the car, 'say, where'd you come from?'  'We parked here so we could walk across the tracks to go shopping!  Really!'"
<p>

Back at his house we played frisbee outside for almost an hour, and I was amazed as the garbage truck went by picking up "garbage" for two reasons:
<ol>
<li>What people will throw away (lots of aluminum cans and glass, bucket of paint, branches and leaves, 4x4 lumber about 5 feet long)</li>
<li>The 4x4 was snapped almost like nothin' as the big scooper thing shoved the garbage toward its belly</li>
</ol>
<p>
Marcel's brother Andre joined us and we played a bit until it got too hot.
<p>
Then we dyed eggs once everyone got home from shopping and I recorded video of Marcel, Kayse and Adrien blowing bubbles and stuff.  Then I recorded Mimi and Caroline and Mimi was all, "you can put that away" (don't record me!) so I told her I wasn't recording but just playing with the different picture effects.
<p>
I could click from "mosaic" to "sun filter" to "something" to "stretch" to "thin" to "B & W" to "photo negative" and that was cool.  Oh, I was recording.
<p>
Had a great discussion with Marcel as I was leaving; we seem to do that- to start talkin' philosophical stuff when we are time constrained... I wonder why!
<p>
It was a great day with my friend.
