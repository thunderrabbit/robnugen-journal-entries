<title>Ministry With Youth</title>

<p class=date>Friday 3 April 1998</p>

<p>
Tonight began Renaissance Module: Ministry With Youth, a weekend workshop designed for Unitarian Universalist religious educators to learn how to support youth and youth advisors in creating a safe space to empower youth.
<p>
Tera Little and Lisa Rubens are the facilitators for the weekend, and that's cool because Tera is an advisor/DRE from my district and she's really great! We went as advisors to many rallies last year.
<p>
This night's work has really encouraged me to just go for it and create my life around youth work. Just give me room and board and access to the Web and I'll do it!
<p>
The most amazing thing I learned tonight was after we ended for the night. Christina Branum-Martin, one of my best friends from my YRUU days actually created what we now know as the Leadership Development Conference or LDC!!  Just several years ago, as a youth, she and Duane Dowell designed them! I feel so honored that Christina is my friend and I am actually kinda jealous/awe-inspired by her work!
<p>
<em>I</em> want to create something like that.
<p>
Oh... the SWD YRUU <a href=http://www.geocities.com/heartland/2735>website</a>.  Yeah, but an annual conference that is now used across the continent!
<p>
Sigh...
<p>
I am inspired. I really want to just quit my job and work doing what I love.
