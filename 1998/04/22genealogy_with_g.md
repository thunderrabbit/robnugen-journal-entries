<title>Genealogy with G</title>

<p class=date>22 April 1998</p>
<p>
My brother Fred and I have begun work on a site of our genealogy- our immediate and extended family as far back and wide as we care to go. The site is incomplete (and may never be made public), so you can't see it right now.
<p>
I only talk about it here because that work has been taking up a lot of time lately..
<p>
We currently have pages essentially for our mom's immediate family.
