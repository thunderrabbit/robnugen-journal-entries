<title>Third Eye Blind tickets</title>

<p class=date>Thursday 9 April 1998</p>
<p>
Wow!
<p>
I was just listening to 107.5 the BUZZ, my favorite evening radio station (would be in the morning, but I hate the new DJ) and my man John Leach was giving away Third Eye Blind concert tickets to the next person who could show him a driver's license with the numbers, 1,0,7 & 5 in the number.  My license does!!
<p>
So I drove drove drove the from work to where John was broadcasting, outside Bayou Place, the newest greatest theater complex in downtown Houston.  I got all excited as I was really close and he came on the air and did <b>not</b> mention a winner!
<p>
One more intersection to go and I parked up on the sidewalk at the corner and <b>ran</b> toward where the booth was and stepped over a couple waiting fans and under the cord roping off their area.  "John!"  <font size=-1>oops wrong guy</font> "John!" 
<p>
He recognized me and I was all, "hey I got my driver's license!" and they were like, woah and I realized that a dude had just gotten there before me and got them. Sigh...
<p>
I congratulated Fred (same as my brother's name!) and he was all, "I don't have them in my hand yet..." but soon John was handing them over, "are you gonna go to the concert?"  Fred was quite affirmative in response and got the tickets.
<p>
Then he was all, "but I might not be able to get a babysitter..." and he <b>gave me a ticket!</b>
<p>
Wow! Wow!
<p>
And what was actually even more rad for me was John recounted the story over the air just as I was arriving back home and was all, "and then 2 seconds later a guy named Rob comes up and Fred was all, 'you know I might not be able to get a babysitter' and gave him one of the tickets!  So they'll be goin' to the concert together and have a good time and a couple beers..."
<p>
I was pumped!
<p>
But wait, before I got home (yes my car was fine on the sidewalk), I remembered "d'oh!  I'm s'posed to meet Kathy at 8pm!"
<p>
Aw man...  So I called her up and left a cancellation type message.  I hated to do that, but I hope she'll understand when I tell the whole story.
<p>
So now I'm gonna get ready and go!
