Today the new version of the New Invoice Service was approved.  This version allows the users to view and print not only invoices, but information obtained through an SQL query to an RDB (Standard Query Language query to a Relational DataBase).
<p>
This is rad because Mario (my supervisor's manager's manager) said this should be the last version we put online before I get to write something else to replace it.  We're lookin' at having me write an interface that can be viewed over the Web.

I washed my car today. I went to the local do-it-yerself place and spent $2.75 to have great fun with the bubbly pink bubbles and the high power splashy spray gun. I love doing that. I got pink bubble juice on my Biff's Wonderful Clamdip T-shirt.

Tonight the LRY is meeting at Chuck E. Cheese Magical Satanical Pizza Place! That's fun 'cause we get to climb all through the tubes and play in the ocean of plastic balls.</p>
