<title>dinner at Ninfa's</title>

<p class=date>Wednesday 22 April 1998</p>
<p>
This night the LRY met at Ninfa's for dinner. As we arrived there were no parking spaces available in two parking lots; I dropped off Wende and parked across 8-lane Westheimer. Just as I got back, millions and millions of men (well, maybe fifty) came out, all comfortably wearing white shirts, khaki pants, work boots! Most had pagers, cell phones, and/or tape measures!
<p>
Turns out it was a quarterly meeting of home builder managers. They left behind plenty of open parking spots.
<p>
At dinner was me, Wende, Laura, Jon, Bryce (friend of Jon's; first time to our dinners), kT and Dennis. We had big fun, and I was happy that kT and Laura took a couple of pictures for our scrapbook. I think creating their scrapbook will help bond the group even more.  Yay!
<p>
Next week, Niko Niko's!
