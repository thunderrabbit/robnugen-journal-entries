<title>Your Mother's Pillow</title>

<p class=date>20 April 1998</p>
<p>
This past weekend I attended a conference called "Your Mother's Pillow," designed and run by Char Tosi, the founder of <a href=https://www.nwn.org/womanwithin/index.html>Woman Within</a>
and Marlene Nappa, who I assume helped Char design the weekend experience.
<p>
I cannot possibly convey the magnitude of healing I received during the weekend.
<p>
My understanding is that men in this culture are often never properly weaned from their mother, and never learn to find mothering, nurturing energy within themselves.  Men often seek this mothering in their adult relationships with other women.  Maybe you have experienced this. I have.
<p>
For me, the great bigpowerfulwonderful experience created a space where I could take my adolescent self back from my mother. I learned that as a man, <b>I</b> can take care of my needs and the needs of the child part of me; I don't have to seek that source of nurturing elsewhere.
<p>
The whole experience was beyond description; I keep saying that...  If you have any interest in healing childhood wounds, start with <a href=https://www.nwn.org/>New Warrior Network</a> if you are a man, and <a href=https://www.nwn.org/womanwithin/index.html>Woman Within</a> if you are a woman.<br>
Makes sense to me.
<p>
Good luck. It is hard work.
