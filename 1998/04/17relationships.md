<title>Relationships</title>

<p class=date>Friday 17 April 1998</p>
<p>
Wende is moving out soon; I am not ready for a "relationship", whatever that is.
<p>
Furthest from my mind, Jori called me two nights ago. I had met her almost two years ago and we almost had sex but didn't. We hadn't spoken since then, including when we saw each other at the laundry mat but woulndn't acknowledge each other.
<p>
One of my biggest patterns is to be in a relationship and say, "no, this one doesn't fix my life," and then move to another relationship and say, "well this one didn't fix my life <b>either</b>! Maybe I'll try this one..."
<p>
And so the cycle has continued and Wende didn't fix my life. So I'm leaving and <b>bang</b> Jori has called and I am tempted but I know only I can make me happy with my life.
<p>
Tonight I begin a weekend workshop called "Your Mother's Pillow," designed to help men work through issues with their women and their mother figures. I look forward to it with excited nervous anticipation.
