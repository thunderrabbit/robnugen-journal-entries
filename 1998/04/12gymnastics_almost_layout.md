<title>Layouts!  almost</title>

<p class=date>21 April 1998</p>
<p>
Today in gymnastics after I did some stretching, but before we really got started, I did two standing back flips onto a big fat mat. Each time, I almost got all the way over. Cool. I haven't done those in years!
<p>
During our tumbling passes I was doing my round off back flips when BB said, "try doing layouts."
<p>
I was all, "err?"
<p>
He's like, "yeah.. you can do it... back flips are too easy for you now."
<p>
Layouts.  Hmmm.  So I did my next round off back flip and it was a stretched-out tuck.
<p>
I commented, "I'm not sure how it's supposed to feel for layout."
<p>
BB suggested "just point your toes and extend your legs.."
<p>
My next one was great! Not layed out, but I shouted "wow! I could really feel that was way way better!  Thanks!"
<p>
That was my best one of the night; I began to think too much and try too hard after that and they got kinda crappy.
<p>
I look forward to getting them perfect!
<p>
Once I could tell they weren't getting better that evening, I went to play on the runway tramp with Ryan, Tanya and Ashley.
<p>
Tanya is so funny, describing how her friends call her "HyperWoman" like the latest super heroine:  "HyperWoman! Quick! They need your help in China! Dig through the earth and save them!"
<p>
On the trampoline, Ryan and I traded various flips: one-and-one-quarter back flips and one-and-one-quarter or one-and-three-quarter front flips, plus high dive rolls or branny-to-back (1/2 twist one-and-one-quarter back flip) or whatever we want. I have great fun doing that.
