<title>Con Con</title>

<p class=date>4pm Tuesday 4 August 1998</p>

<br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>Lunch then chilled and we had a fire drill, bringing everyone to the volley ball court downhill from all the cabins. 

<p>The fire drill was also a sneaky way to get us all assembled for a big ConCon group photo (which I should most certainly scan and put on the web!) for which Jeremy sat on my shoulders.

<p>Then I arrived late for the adult check-in meeting but it was all good and afterward I said HI and talked to Kathryn, advisor from this area. We talked for quite a while. I had kicked off the conversation with, "what do you think happens after we die?"

<p>She gave her thoughts, and I mine, and the conversation spun off to my high school shyness transformation into college craziness and YRUU advising and dream flying and OOBE and awareness of the world in general.  Now we are going to walk to the creek.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>Kathryn is encouraging me to apply for an Adult-at-large position on Youth Council. Part of me is going, "yeah, but" and I am scared to do it but don't know why.

<p>I believe I can do Youth Council and local youth work. I can do it. She just gave me privacy to write.

<p>I told her I had applied for the adult coordinator position for this ConCon. I didn't make it, but that doesn't mean I should try again. What if I quit trying to walk when I fell the first time?

<p>Ah- here it is -- I'm continually wanting to be "experienced" to be grown up..  I want to do "that" (whatever someone else has already done) instead of recognizing that this moment, each moment *is* my experience. My experience is continually unfolding before me.

<p>I'm gonna go for it. I'll talk to Jen Harrison and apply and go for it!
