<title>Con Con</title>

<p class=date>11:30am Tuesday 4 August 1998</p>

<br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>Woke up and read part of <em>Shield</em> and talked to Torger and Galen and others on staff out on our cabin porch. Then breakfast and sat at the same table with mostly the same group as dinner last night. We talked and chilled a bit and bounced a plastic ring from a coke bottle plastic cap.

<p>At the Spirt Circle I sat between Carol and Jeremy who sang "Greasy Grimey Gopher Guts" for everyone.  Well he started it but didn't remember quite all the lyrics..

<p>I made an announcement encouraging people to write in what we in the Southwest District call the "Big Gray Rally Book," a YRUU diary that is actually volume II. I started volume 1 back in July 1996 at the New Orleans Rally.

<p>Then someone (I think Allison or maybe Mimi) led the "Happy Boy" song, which I didn't know, but many people did and sang along with it.  Something about a dead dog and his guts in a jar.

<p>During the Growth Stages workshop, we did a bonding game and had a ten minute nap, during which I actually fell asleep!  Nice.
Then we shared stories about our first memories before 5 years old.
