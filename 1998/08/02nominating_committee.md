Rob, I wanted to tell you that you have been elected by the district
board to the district nominating committee.  Congratulations, and thank you
again for being willing to serve! 
__________ is chairperson of the nominating committee, and she will let 
you know what needs to happen when.  I will be sending an e-mail to everyone
on the new committee soon.  
Penny
