<title>Con Con flyin there</title>

<p class=date>Monday 3 August 1998</p>

<br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>On the ground below I can see huge block letters of green (trees?) on brown dirt background:

<pre>LUECKI</pre>

<p>I wonder what the heck it means (city name?) or where it is...

<p>We've been flying for about an hour and I'm seeing some intricate roadways that look like an old circuit board.  Pretty cool, but the weird thing is they don't see to go anywhere. The road ends, but there's nothing there.

<p>But I'm writing now because I think I just saw a particle accelerator, though I don't know of any in this area.  It was perfectly round, not cleared in the middle, and big. I don't really have a way to judge how big, but I'd guess 1/2 mile to a mile across.

<p>(I asked the pilot about it as I left. He didn't know for sure, but suggested it was a mine.  hmmm.)
