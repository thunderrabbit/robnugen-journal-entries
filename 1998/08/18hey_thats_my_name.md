<title>Hey that's my name</title>

<p class=date>18 August 1998</p>

<p>I got home from gymnastics and had a voice message from Bridge! I haven't seen her in like 6 years, and I was surprised to hear her area code is 281. That's near me! (Last I heard she was in Virginia)

<p>But here's the weird part: I called her back and her son Robert answered. Nothing too strange about that, (except that he's 9 now instead of 3) but when I told him my name he's all "that's my name!"

<p>I feigned surprise. "Really?"

<p>Back in the day, I was one of Bridge's best friends and she named her first son after me. Wow.  And it just really hit home when he was all, "that's my name!" ... and I'm thinkin' "I know!"

<p>So I'm talkin' to Bridge now and she's surfin' my site for the first time and I'll let her get a sneak preview of this page.
