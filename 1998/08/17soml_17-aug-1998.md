<title>State of My Life</title>

<p class=date>8:30am 17 August 1998</p>

<h1>STATE OF MY LIFE</h1>


<ol>
<p><li>I am pissed right now at Windows 98 because my web browsers keep locking up and stuff.</li>

<p><li>I've been feeling overall crappy in my life; I feel unproductive even though I'm doing stuff all the time. I'm doing youth work, organizing projects, encouraging participation, pulling staples, attending conferences and dinners...</li>

<p><li>but my apartment is a wreck and sometimes I think "I shouldn't have broken up with Wende" cause she obviously did a lot more work on the apartment than I ever recognized. Or maybe it's just been because I've been out of town for essentially 3 weeks of the past month.</li>

<p><li>I haven't gotten my ConCon journal entries transcribed yet. They are all written in my diary, but not here on my webpage.</li>

<p><li>I got 10 rolls of film developed from the week of ConCon. Fabulous pictures in several cases and I may scan them and get them on here.</li>

<p><li>I'm getting a few hits per day; I thank you all for visiting and/or returning as the case may be!</li>

<p><li>I have to zip off to the Lodge now for work.</li>

<p><font size =-1>3:30pm</font>

<p><li>after work I'm feelin' better, and have scheduled a chat with my friend Char (pronounced "shar"), who I see infrequently.  Each time we talk, she offers fabulous insightful thoughts that have always helped me become clear about my life.</li>

</ol>
