<title>Goodnight, Tree</title>

<p class=date>Monday 31 August 1998</p>

<p>Tonight when I got home from I-group, I noticed the tree at the corner of the parking lot had, um.. let's say, done an impression of the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  Its branches were brushing the ground, making a virtual jungle where I normally park Scott.

<p>So I parked Scottie on the street and checked out the situation. 

<p>Turns out the power lines were holding the tree up from falling all the way over. The very short shallow roots had just lifted right out of the ground on one side and that was it!

<p>I greatly thank my angels for such an easy tree removal process.  No cars were crunched, the apartment building was not smushed, and the only thing that had to be repaired was my phone line.

<p>The parking lot is pretty small, so even the staircase in the back of the building was a virtual jungle of branches.  I climbed up the steps like an old Aztec pyramid in the jungle.

<p>I called my landlord who called the light company and they came out at 11pm.  They looked at the tree. "This is too big for us; we'll have to call a tree crew."

<p><pre>(The "Tree Crew" ?  I've never heard of them.)</pre>

<p>I went to bed, and gave thanks in advance for waking up gently as soon as the crew got here.  I wanted to take pictures!

<p>I woke up, didn't hear anything, so went back to sleep and then "whoah!" I heard chain saws!  So I grabbed my camera and zipped outside, down through the jungle and took pictures.

<p>I actually went crazy and took an entire roll; we'll see how they turn out, and I expect to scan them onto my site soon.</p>
