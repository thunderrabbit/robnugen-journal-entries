<title>Con Con</title>

<p class=date>9:20am Monday 3 August 1998</p>

<br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>I'm in seat 24A of Continental flight 1989 about to leave for ConCon. Celine Dion's "My heart will go on" is playing quietly over the speakers as two boys with English accents talk with their parents behind me, including "if I sit heah, I con't see tha TV."

<p>This weekend I got all my planned activities complete, including transcribing all my SWUUSI journal entries, updating the Houston YRUU (pronounced "why are you you" short for Young Religious Unitarian Universalists) webpage, seeing my mom preach at Thoreau Congregation, and attending the youth worship last night, during which we decided to create a Houston YAC (Youth-Adult Committee) which can make the decisions that need to be made for the YRUU activities in the Houston area.

<p>On Saturday I went to Maggie and John's and met Wende out there for dinner and ate then left around 9pm and met Manda at IHOP after going to say HI to Rebecca at Indigo Angel who wasn't there so I left a note.

<p>Manda and I went to a park and chilled and swung on swings and climbed and slid down slides and rocked on a huge rocking gazebo and talked till like 1:30am. I went home and got to bed around 2am.

<p>The plane is now taxiing slowly through the terminal area.

<p>Last night I did a panic pack, including depositing checks and withdrawing cash, purchasing film and razors at Walgreen's, and finally got all my stuff packed and went to bed at 5am.

<p>Awake at 7am and Manda drove me to the airport and now I'm on the plane and here I am.
