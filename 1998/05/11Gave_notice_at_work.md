<title>Gave notice at work</title>

<p class=date>11 May 1998</p>

<p>Today my boss was all pissy when he came in to work and it rubbed off on me. While we were in our weekly meeting, I had to close my eyes in meditation so I wouldn't suddenly announce,<br>
"I quit."

<p>After the meeting, I talked with Dave and we hashed out our differences and stuff. We were all cool and I talked to him about wanting a leave of absence starting in June. We had discussed it before so he wasn't caught entirely off guard.

<p>We talked about 30 minutes, including the possibility of me not coming back. He said that if I did I would have to be ready to work. By the end I was all, "I'm not coming back."

<p>So I gave my notice as my last day being 18 June 1998.

<p>With a newfound joy, I jumped on my current project and got more work done on it than I would have.

<p>Weird.</p>
