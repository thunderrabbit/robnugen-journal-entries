<title>Chuck E. Cheese</title>

<p class=date>Wednesday 6 May 1998</p>

<p>Dinner this night was at Chuck E. Cheese's and we had 14 youth show up!  That's the most we've had at any Wednesday night dinner.  We had representation from 3 or 4 churches!

<p>A great time was had by all, I believe.  I mostly didn't spend many tokens.  Probably about 1 dollar worth and then I just watched the youth doing various games and stuff.

<p>Paul did super great on Solar Attack (or something like that) big video screen video game, getting past any level I had seen on it.

<p>We had super great fun in the ball pit, with about 10 of us in there, throwing the balls all over the place (mostly inside the maze of tubes) and having a chaotic wonderful time.

<p>After a couple of hours, parents wandered back to pick up their respective youth and we all left.
