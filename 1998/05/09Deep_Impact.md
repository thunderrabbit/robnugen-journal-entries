<title>Deep Impact</title>

<p class=date>Saturday 9 May 1998</p>

<p>Eric and I just went to see Deep Impact.  I will "review" the movie in two different parts.  I say "review" because I've never done this before; we'll see how it turns out.

<p><font size=+1>Technically</font>, the movie had tons of flaws.
Here's what I can think of off the top of my head:

<ul>

<p><li>In the very opening scene a kid saw the comet in a telescope and knew it was not a star since it wasn't on the charts. Fine. The astromer instructor dude goes, "it's probably a satellite."<br>
NO!! Satellites visibly move across the sky.  The object was fuzzy looking; a satellite in that size telescope would have been sharp... Unless of course the telescope was focused on a star.  But it would have been moving.</li>

<p><li>Astronauts flew a big ship to go destroy the comet. Fine.
But they flew through the tail of the comet, and huge chunks of rock and ice were flying off of it.<br>
NO!! A comet's tail is <em>dust</em>. Dust!</li>

<p><li>And they <b>landed</b> on it and were walking around on it.<br>
NO!! A comet 7 miles across does not have enough mass so they can <em>land</em> on it and walk around on it!  The tiniest hint of pressure would send them tumbling away into the nothingness.</li>

<p><li>And the tail was only tens of miles long (judging by the size of the comet, which was 7 miles across in the movie).<br>
NO!!  Comet tails are tens of millions of miles long.</li>

<p><li>When the comet hit earth, it came in at a pretty shallow angle and sailed gloriously across the sky.  Fine.  I guess.
But when it hit the earth, a mushroom cloud exploded straight up, with impact blast in a perfect circle!<br>
NO!! All the momentum woulda blown everything that direction! Momentum is conserved!!</li>
</ul>

<p>Argh!

<p>Okay.

<p>The special effects of the various cities and stuff being destroyed were pretty good.  Interesting camera angles.

<p>And now, the good parts of the movie..

<p>First, the premise was that the United States was going to house one million people in underground caves for two years. They specifically chose two hundred thousand people and were going to randomly select eight hundred thousand people.

<p>Some excellent philosophical questions were brought up.

<p>Here are a few off the top of my head:

<p><ul>
<li>What if you were chosen to live? Would you go?</li>
<li>What if you were chosen and your (significant person in your life) were not?</li>
<li>Would you give up your space so they could go?</li>
<li>If you knew you would die, would you run screaming?</li>
<li>If you knew you would die, would you face your death proudly?</li>
<li>If you thought you might live, would you kill yourself because life would be so crappy afterwards anyway?</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are just some questions that bounced through my mind.

<p>So it brings up some good questions, and had the entire theater sniffling back tears.  I was sniffling back tears at the parts designed to be tear-jerking... and the technical errors, too.</p>
