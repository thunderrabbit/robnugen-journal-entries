<title>Moving my homestead??</title>

<p class=date>13 May 1998</p>

<p>Today I added the GeoGuide to the YRUU site. I was impressed with the ease of putting it on the site and that it keeps the annoying pop-up windows from popping up.

<p>The GeoGuide includes a banner, which may be someone's personal webpage on Geocities.... Like maybe <b>my</b> webpage on Geocities..  Hmmm.

<p>So I looked at what it would take to get my banner on there and it's not too hard except they want the website being advertised to match its homestead and address.  Hmmm.  Mine does not.

<p>Therefore, I am actually considering moving my site to SoHo instead of Baja. However, there are many links that have baja/2175 hardcoded in them..  Hmmm.

<p>So then I thought, ahhh.. too much trouble; I won't do it.

<p>Then I thought from a bigger scale... wait-a-minute.  What is my goal? More hits on my page. What else?  Um, I don't know.
<br>Fine, so in one year do you want to have even <b>more</b> hardcoded links out in the world to have to change or what?  Cause the you then will be all mad at the you now for being a wuss for not just doing the work and getting it finished!

<p>Good point.

<p>Then(!!!) I realized something else.  Wait-a-minute!  I can use www.geocities.com/~thunderrabbit to get to my site! So I can just tell everyone to use that URL and then when I move to a new address, no problem. Everything will work beautifully smoothly and it'll be all good.

<p>The biggest obstacle I have overcome so far is emailing the seven Robs who are part of the <b>Webring for people named Rob</b> and asking them to change their references to my page.

<p>Once those pages all get fixed, the rest is smooth sailin'.

<p>So, if you have a link to my page, please make it http://www.geocities.com/~thunderrabbit/</p>
