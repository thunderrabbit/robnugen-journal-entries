<p class=date>Friday 8 May 1998</p>

<p>This morning I went to my chiropractor to let her adjust my
back.. My lower back was still hurting after gymnastics on Tuesday.
She popped it and stuff but it still hurt. I got up and was all, "it
doesn't feel much better."

<p>So she had me lay down and she accupunctured me. 6 needles right in
the area and they didn't hurt at all, but I could feel them and my
awareness was really brought to the painful part of me spine.  She had
me lift one hip and oooooohh wow that feels better.

<p>I was amazed.  After about 8 minutes with needles in my back, it
feels absolutely entirely better. I am really impressed.
