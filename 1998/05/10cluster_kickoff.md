<p class=date>10 May 1998</p>

<p>Today was Flower Communion at my church.  The service stems from
way back in Czechloslavakia when Norbert Capek (The 'C' character is
actually a C with a v on it.) a Unitarian minister, wanted to have a
communion but not using bread and wine.
<br> That's the short version of the story.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.

<p>Today after church, Mary McCuen and I, en route to Einstein
Bros. Bagels, talked about activities for the summer. This Wednesday
for our LRY dinner, we're going to invite all the youth from the seven
local UU churches to meet so we can plan some dates for meetings
during the summer!

<p>I'm super excited about actually doing to cluster level stuff,
getting the group together <em>doing</em> stuff together... I'm
excited about the possibilities.

<p>So I called Christina Branum-Martin and she said she was interested
in having youth worships during the summer. We now plan to have a
worship in the evening of each first Sunday of the month. Yay!

<p>I'm doing the smiley bouncy dance just thinking about it!</p>
