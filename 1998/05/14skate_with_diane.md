<title>Skating</title>

<p class=date>14 May 1998</p>

<p>I just got back from skating downtown with Diane. It was the first time we've skated in months! And before that it was like half a year before we had skated!

<p>I excitedly described the hopes and visions I have for the cluster, and that I'd like to create a position where I can actually make some dollars doing that which I love.

<p>Diane asked about the new phone number for Wende that's indicated on my answering machine. I explained that she moved out and the conversation turned to how Wende feels about me making dollars as a youth advisor. After hearing the situation, Diane quickly articulated how I could sell the idea of creating a paid position for Wende as well!

<p>I had never thought of such a possibility of having <b>two</b> paid positions because I can hardly fathom <b>me</b> getting paid for it.  Wow.

<p>We first skated to Jones Plaza where I noticed there were surprisingly few skaters! When we got up there, we were asked to sign an IpromisenottosueifIbustmyass waiver before we go in.

<p>Diane was pretty entertained reading the legal jargon. However, we were not sufficiently entertained to sign it.

<p>Down the street to a parking lot we went where I got a call from Ms Wende on my cell phone. I described to her the idea and I think she liked it. We'll have to talk about it later.

<p>Wende was entirely pissed and sad that I was out skating with Diane. We spent nearly 10 minutes on the phone while Diane skated in big circles around the parking lot.

<p>Once I got off the phone, Diane was all, "well, did you tell her that we are just friends and not interested in a sexual relationship?" No I hadn't.

<p>Diane encouraged me to call her back, so I did and that helped a lot.  Thank you, Diane.

<p>Then we cruised out to our parking lot at the base of the Main Street hill.  (That's the hill by University of Houston Downtown campus, quickly down which I love to skate.)

<p>We spent probably 30 minutes there, skating in large circles around the parking lot, with me jumping up and down a pair of sequential curb things. (Yeah that makes sense)  Anyway, it was like two curbs right in a row, so I jumped up then down then back up in a tiny little space. Pretty fun stuff.

<p>After a while, we headed back, but stopped by Jones Plaza for me to go car surfing. Well, Diane stopped and I went up the street to catch the next green light pod of traffic. Just as I arrived, the light was fully green and the cars were zipping through so I made a tight turn and joined their ranks.

<p>push push push push until I was up to speed and just behind a long Oldsmobile looking car. I was slightly to his right so he could turn left in front of me with no problem.

<p>Zing through the light and he didn't turn left but he's slowing down.... So I look to the right (it's clear) and slide right into the next lane of traffic and pass the Olds. whhiishh!

<p>There's a car fully slowed in front of me so I slide back left in front of the Olds and zip through the light. Perfect! Push push push push through and keep angling left toward the curb and hop onto the sidewalk to stop.

<p>I love doing that!

<p>Diane clapped for me as I skated back up the hill to her.

<p>"Did you see me pass that car???" I was out of breath.

<p>"I <b>did</b> see it. Wow!"

<p>Yay! That was super super fun.

<p>We skated slowly back up Louisiana and stopped by for cold water at the YMCA before getting back to her truck. We took our skates off and stretched and she brought me home and here I am.</p>
