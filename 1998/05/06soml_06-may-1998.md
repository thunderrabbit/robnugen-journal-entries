<center>State of my Life</center>

<ol>
<li>Wow-  I haven't written in a while.  Lots of stuff has happened but I don't think I'll get caught up.</li>
<li>I got a new computer:  Pentium II 233 Mhz, two 2.5 gig hard drives, 64 Megs memory, 24X CD Rom, 17" monitor with 4 Megs on the card, sound card, etc.</li>
<li>I've been messing with it a bit each day and will hopefully have a 56k modem working soon, and then I'll get the Feel Good Net going again, which hasn't gone out in 2.5 weeks because THEY at my JOB say "thou shalt not surf" while at work.<br>
I'm surfing now!!! HA HAHAHAahaahaahhaa</li>
<li>Oops there's the boss gotta go.</li>

<p><li>So I got my computer hooked up last night and I tried to finish this entry but the computer at WORK quit responding so what I typed was lost.</li>
<li>I am now back to working on the New Invoice Service at work. I am adding the capability to write output to a disk file instead of just to the screen or printer. It should be pretty easy.</li>
<li>I am actively working on taking a leave of absence from work. I want time off this summer to do or attend the following:
<ul>
<li>General Assembly (24-30 June)</li>
<li>New Orleans Rally (3-5 July)</li>
<li>laser surgery on my eyes (circa 6 July)</li>
<li>SWUUSI (26-31 July)</li>
<li>ConCon (3-9 August)</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the Job won't give me that much time off, I say, "fine- I don't need the money."</li>
</ol></p>
