<title>SHOCK</title>

<p class=date>2:37am Sunday 10 May 1998</p>

<p>Tonight Wende and I went to a new dance club called SHOCK. I had gotten on the guest list by calling my homey John Leach at radio station KTBZ 107.5 The Buzz on Thursday night. I asked him about the new club and what was the dress code. I was like, "you're going to be there on Saturdays?"

<p>And he goes, "yeah; do you want to be on the guest list?"

<p>"Tight," I exclaimed firmly when he signed me up.

<p>So tonight Wende and I went and I danced and she sat and watched me dance. She says she had more fun that it may have appeared, so I'm glad about that.

<p>When we got there, I said HI to John Leach and introduced Wende.

<p>Wende didn't want to dance, but I had a super marvelous time fast fast fast dancing to fairly good music. Not as overall fast as Numbers, but pretty good.

<p>I danced for almost 1.5 hours (I think) and flirted some but mostly kept to myself.
