<title>Feels like the end of a semester of school</title>

<p class=date>14 May 1998</p>

<p>The feeling I have now while at work is the same as I had when the semester would come toward the end at school. Longing desire to be <b>finished</b> but I can't slack off yet.

<p>And then part of me goes, well, actually you <b>can</b> slack off now and it really wouldn't matter all that much. It's just 2 pay periods you would miss.  

<p>Two pay periods? 1 month? Hmmm. Actually 2.5 pay periods. Do I need the dollars? I don't know.

<p>I am considering having laser surgery done on my eyes. 2.5 pay periods would pay for most of that. Hmm. For my eyes I can do it.

<p>But arggghh!!!!</p>
