<p>Tonight in gymnastics I did some pretty cool stuff. I did round off back flips but did not get them as layouts very well at all. We were on a different floor which seemed softer than the other.  I don't know if that really made a difference or not.

<p>But I did do a few russian front flips. "Russian" in that case is the style of motion used to power the flip. Arms swing in big forward circles and then lift from the back kinda. It's easier if I show you but I'm probably not physically with you as you read this. Maybe later.

<p>I bounced around on the runway tramp and just did a backflip with 1/2 twist. Cool. So I did it again and almost wacked the wall. Hmmm. So I did it again and after not too long pretty much had them stable and consistent. Half the time I would do a back branny (twist as I flip) and half the time I would do the beginning of an arabian (flip, and then twist). Cool stuff.

<p>Then Ryan and I got on the big trampolines and challenged each other to a front flip contest. We would flip and flip and flip and flip,... doing front flips and landing on our backs each time. Our feet never touched the trampoline.<br>
So anyway, we each got like 10 in a row, and by that time were pretty much too tired and dizzy to do much else.<br>
At least I was too tired. Ryan did some other stuff which I couldn't do and can't describe either, so oh well.

<p>It was a super fun night.</p>
