<title>Wende's cats moved out</title>

<p class=date>Monday 11 May 1998</p>

<p>Today Wende moved most of the rest of her stuff out, including her cats. She did a super fantastic job sweeping up the 20 or 30 pounds of cat hair from the living room and dining room.

<p>It was unreal to me..  Seeing the hardwood floor again, without the rug... I have my space back!  I am excited about that. I really appreciate Wende's hard work to clean up.

<p>Spot, my cat, is still in a state of disbelief.  For 1.5 years he has not been able to safely venture past the bedroom to where Wende's cats were. I didn't see him all night; I wonder if he was scared to come in the window because the bedroom door is open?</p>
