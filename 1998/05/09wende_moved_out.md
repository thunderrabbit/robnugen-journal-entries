<p class=date>Saturday 9 May 1998</p>

<p>Wende is basically moved out.  Maggie, Eric and I packed mostly all her stuff and brought it to her new apartment while John and Wende drove to Dallas and got her bed and bureau and stuff.

<p>Once we were done for the day, we got pizza from Star Pizza across the street (I expect Wende will get frequent flyer miles there because it's so good and so accessible).  We ate and then I drove with Maggie to her house to pick up Wende's truck while Wende unpacked.

<p>I came back and spent the night with Wende, to help her transition into her new place. Now I'm at home ready to clean up and get some stuff caught up.

<p>Her cats are still here, so she's not totally out yet.</p>
