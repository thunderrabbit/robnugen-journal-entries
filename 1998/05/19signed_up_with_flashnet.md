<title>signed up with flashnet</title>

<p class=date>19 May 1998</p>

<p>I just now got myself signed up on Flashnet, an ISP to replace the access I get from work.  Since I'm quittin' soon, I'm weaning myself away from work.

<p>I have my new computer, and I just ordered a new 56k modem online today.

<p>At most 23 more days of work here after today.</p>
