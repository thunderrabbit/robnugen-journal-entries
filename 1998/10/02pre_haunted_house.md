<title>Before Haunted House</title>

<p class=date>2 October 1998</p>

<p>I'm right now listening to nine inch nails' "the downward spiral" on _downward spiral_  CD.

<p>As soon as the CD ends I'm leaving to go check out a haunted house with the youth group!  There are 3 houses super close to each other near downtown on Fannin Street.  Haunted Hotel, Haunted Hotel 2, and Fear Factory.

<p>Earlier today I cruised out there to see where to park and stuff before they get all crowded.  I talked to the owner dude (owns all three) and he gave me a teeny bit of inside info - how many of what different types of animated monsters they have in which hotels and that kind of stuff. 

<p>He suggested that we start at _Fear Factory_ and we'll get discount passes to the other two.

<p>I assured him that not all of the group would want to go to all the houses, but I appreciated his offer!

<p>When I worked at Telecheck, I wrote a program that calculated the number of days between any two dates.  I used it to determine how many days old I was, and determined that I turned 10000 days old on 10 August 1997.  

<p>But I quit Telecheck and had no access to the program.

<p>So my dad wrote a version for Windows!  I'll put it on here so you can download it soon.

<p>CD is over; I'm outta here!
