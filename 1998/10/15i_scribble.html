<title>my Scribble</title>

<p class=date>Thursday 15 October 1998</p>

<p>I've been goofing around with JavaScript and some .gif animations.
My sense is that although *my* page hasn't had much animation and
stuff on it, if I wanna make pages for others, I need to know how to
do it.

So, while goofing around, I made this scribble.
