<title>Butts Up</title>

<p>(*) Butts Up requires a large wall against which to throw a small
bouncy ball, ground on which to run, a bouncy ball to throw and at
least 5 players.  For the ball, a tennis ball or racquet ball is
good. A baseball or bowling ball is bad.  A superball is a maybe,
depending on the group and the area.

<p>The goal is to not get hit by the ball.  Any player throws the ball
at the wall usually as hard as possible.  Any player, even the same
player tries to catch the ball and throw it at the wall.  Simple.

<p>Chaos ensues when a player drops the ball while trying to catch it,
or is simply hit by the ball and doesn't catch it.  That player must
run and touch the wall before another player throws the ball and hits
them with it.  Often, in a scramble to hit the other player, the
second player will drop the ball, and have to run for the wall.

<p>If someone hits the player who dropped the ball before that player
touches the wall, it's time for "butts up"

<p>Each player who dropped the ball and was subsequently hit by
another player has to crouch down at the wall with their butt in the
air to be pegged again by the player who got them, and/or by each
other player in the game!

<p>So that is Butts Up.  We were playing Wall Ball which is different
in that the player who dropped has to touch the wall before another
player hits the wall with the ball.  And the butt in air aspect is not
there - it's simply spread eagle and a light to medium toss by a
single player as "punshiment"
