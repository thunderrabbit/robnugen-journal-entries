<title>scanned images</title>

<p class=date>Friday 23 October 1998</p>

<p>Dude!

<p>I just found a ton of pics and have scanned several.

<p><a href="/images/college/front_page.jpg">This</a> is my favorite of them all. I was on the front page of The Daily Cougar, UH school newspaper on Friday 18 March 1994, which is Maggie and Molly's birthday!

<p><a href="/images/college/under_fountain.html">These 3 pics</a> were all taken by me or Will when we went down into the control room under the big water fountain at UH.
<br>On my site, these pics are in a directory called step, which was an acronym for Sub-Terrain Exploration Posse. I'll scan more of these, and I think I can find our charter.

<p>Oh yes!  I have just scanned and uploaded the initial formation of the ultra-top-secret ultra-short-lived <a href="/images/college/mission_statement.jpg">Sub-Terrain Exploration Posse</a>

<p><a href="/images/college/broken_disc.jpg">This</a> was taken after we played High Speed Wall Collision with the disc.

<p><a href="/images/college/kristof.html">These</a> are of me and Marcel posing as Kristof and Kristof... It's a long story.  Okay, I'll tell you.

<blockquote>I was on the Homecoming Committee in 1993 and fanagled myself the position of Recycling Day Chairperson.  All semester, Marcel and I had been doing our impressions of Hans and Frans from Saturday Night Live.

<p>"Yah, dasright!"

<p>So anyway, we thought, wouldn't it be cool to make a TV commercial advertising Recycling Day and we could be Hans and Frans and it will be great!

<p>Then we were all, wait 'Hans and Frans' might be a trademarked name, so we won't use it.  Hmmmm.. what are some good German names?   hmmmm.

<p>That semester we were taking Databases with Dr Eick, a tall almost hulking man with a thick German accent.  (We had so much fun doing impressions of him, but that's a different story.)
His first name was Kristof.

<p>Kristof!! That's a great German name!  Hmmmm  okay we need one more..

<p>We couldn't think of another good german name so after a while, a conversation went like this:

<p>"Dude.  Why don't we both be Kristof?"

<p>"Dude!  Hmmm.  Let's try it."

<p>"I'm Kristof!"

<p>"Yah, und I'm Kristof!"

<p>"And if you don't recycle, we'll be pissed off!!!!!"

<p>YES!!!!

<p>So we put on sweat pants and sweat shirts, stuffed them with balloons and made the commercial, which was entirely entirely so much fun.

<p>The film editor put the thing together and put it on the UH (campus only) TV station and it was great.  Except there was no audio recorded with it.

<p>Sigh..  So no one got to hear our super hilarious accents and our oh-so-witty names.  But we had fun.</p>
