<title>Houston flooded pics!!</title>

<p class=date>9 October 1998</p>
<br>Updated 27 October 1998 with dry pictures

<p><a href="/cgi-local/journal.pl?date=1998/09/11#Houston_flooded_21">Here</a> is the original entry from when Houston flooded.

<p>Walking down Montrose toward the intersection with Allen Parkway, we saw <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/overview.jpg">this</a>.
<br>"Wow; it's flooded."
<br>Yes, but understand that Allen Parkway goes <em>under</em> that intersection.
<br><a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/dryview.jpg">Here</a> is the normal version.

<p><a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/red_reflection.jpg">This</a> was
taken from the middle of the intersection.  I like how the red light reflects on the water.
<br>Notice how the red light is nearly washed out by the sunlight <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/no_reflection.jpg">here</a>.

<p>Next we turned right along Allen Parkway and took a pic across the street.  <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/parked.jpg">This bus</a> was empty. 
<br>I didn't take a dry version of this shot.

<p>A bit further down Allen Parkway we looked back toward the <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/wet.jpg">intersection</a>.  In the pic I can barely see the guy in white and lady in blue right in front of the yellow truck.  The trucks did go across the street.
<br><a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/dry.jpg">Here</a> is the dry version.

<p>Looking the other direction from the same location, the water was pouring over the <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/over_rail.jpg">guard rail</a>.   In the top right corner of that picture can be seen the reflection of this <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/tressel.jpg">railroad tressel</a> that crosses Allen Parkway.
<br><a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/dry_tressel.jpg">The tressel</a> again.

<p>Here is the <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/flood_gauge.jpg">flood gauge</a> that made us laugh so hard.  It is somewhat past the railroad tressel.
<br><a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/dry_gauge.jpg">Not flooded</a> version.

<p>And here are pics of <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/eric_no_park.jpg">Eric</a> and <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/rob_no_park.jpg">me</a> under the tressel. 
No parking here!!
<br>Still <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/still_no_parking.jpg">no parking</a>.

<p>Walking back toward Montrose, we saw this <a
href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/u_st_thomas.jpg">helpful sign</a>.
<br><a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/u_st_dry.jpg">again</a>.</p>
