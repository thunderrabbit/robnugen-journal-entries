<title>prime examples</title>

<p class=date>21 October 1998</p>

<p>After chatting with Jen last night, I shut down Windows and booted my linux partition.  After a bit of playing, I found the following interesting numbers (among many many others) on my screen:

<p><pre>
666667
888887
987659
1000003
1001003
1234577
1357901
1444441
1777771
3333331
1777777777
214783647
</pre>

<p>"So?" you may ask.

<p><a href="index.html">Back</a> you may press.

<p>What are those numbers?

<p>They are all prime numbers.  Like 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ... they can only be evenly divided by 1 and themselves.

<p>Really?

<p>Well, I don't know, but I trust the linux executable to know what it's doing.

<p>214783647 was the largest number I could start it counting from.  Any number larger than that to start and it would respond with "Ouch."

<p>However, I piped the output through less and came up with 1777777777 as prime.  Cool.

<p>I let it run all night and the largest prime it found was 4294967291.
<br>Nice.
