On Tuesday, I went to gymnastics class for the first time in probably
3.5 to 4 years ??!!!!
<p>
Wow how wonderful it was to be back on that big bouncy blue carpet!  
<p>
We started with some walking handstands and then cartwheels then
roundoffs then after a bit I was doing roundoff back flips!! Big big
tall high back flips and I felt glorious and joyful!
After the hour of class, I went to the runway trampoline and did some
front flips and even was able to get a proper front layout flip once.
Way way way fun.
I got on the high bar, but after only a few swings, I could feel my palm
screaming "RIP!"
I didn't rip, but dropped off and wondered how I was able to do it
previously..  I think I need to loosen my grip some.

I met Nelson, Eric, Lyle, Catherine, Jennifer, Tasha, Kenneth, and BB.</p>
