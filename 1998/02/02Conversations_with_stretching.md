<title>Conversations with stretching</title>

<p class=date>Monday 2 February 1998</p>
<p>
Today I worked from 2am to 9am, babysitting the computers for our end of month processing.  <br>
During this, I read a few chapters of <em>Conversations With God</em> by Neale Donald Walsch.  This book is really incredible and I finished it today after napping once I got home.
<p>
I understand it to describe the main thing to do in life is to be, not to do stuff, but just be.  Just exist and experience life consciously.
<p>
In the book, God also said our physical bodies are designed to last forever.  Cool.
<p>
So, after putting down the book, I asked my body what it needed now in order to continue forever.  
<p>
My body said "stretch."
<p>
With superconscious deliberate movements, I slowly stretched, reminding my outer mind of Tai Chi I learned about two years ago. 
<p>
I just let my hands, arms, legs, back, neck, feet, everything just stretch and flow and move where they wanted.  What a blissful wonderful exercise.
<p>
Thank you, body.</p>
