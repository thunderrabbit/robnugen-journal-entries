<title>KTRU application</title>

<p class=date>21 December 1998</p>

<p>I am sure I mentioned previously that I applied to be a DJ at KTRU. I never heard back from them until I got this letter:

<b>To:</b> thunderrabbit@cheerful.com
<br><b>Subject:</b> KTRU Application

<pre>
hi, i am ellen's sister and i work at KTRU (i actually was the one 
who opened the door for you, although i didn't know it was you).  i know 
your brother, fred, although he always confuses me with a girl named lee 
meredith, and i also know mike ossowski (he doesn't confuse me with 
anybody) and perhaps other YRUUers that you would know.  anyhow, i am 
emailing you so that you do not get discouraged about your KTRU 
application.  the dj director either did not have enough time to hire 
for the christmas break, or didn't feel that we needed any new dj's at 
the time (my guess is the former, since we will be off at night 
probably).  i will make sure that your application remains on file for 
consideration in the spring.

good luck,
meg
