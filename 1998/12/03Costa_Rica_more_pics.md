<p class=date>Thursday 3 December 1998</p>

<p>Holy cow it's almost 1999!!!

<p>This week:

<p><ul>
<li>I've been advertising that I can sign people up with Flashnet, and am quite pleased with the results!
<li>I applied to be a DJ at KTRU, Rice Radio
<li>I've shown my Costa Rica pics to a lot of people
<li>I've been preparing to drive to Little Rock, Arkansas tomorrow for a rally

</ul>

<p>Tonight I scanned and uploaded several more pics.  Click <a
