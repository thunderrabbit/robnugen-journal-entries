<title>State of My Life</title>

<p class=date>11 December 1998</p>

<h1>STATE OF MY LIFE</h1>

<p><ol>

<p><li>It's about time for another journal entry.  (HI Lisa!)</li>

<p><li>Just last weekend I drove to Little Rock, Arkansas with a little side trip to Tulsa, Oklahoma to pick up some youth for a rally!</li>

<p><li>This weekend, in three hours, I'm picking up Jeremy and Cathy from the bus station and then Nick up along I-45, and we'll go to Dallas for Maia's Social Action Conference!</li>

<p><li>I haven't packed yet.</li>

<p><li>I'm *almost* done with my <a href="/travel/costa_rica/1998/">Costa Rica</a> stories!</li>

<p><li>Today Bridge and I went to Souper Salad for lunch. We're friends from high school but we hadn't seen each other in like 5 or 8 years!</li>

<p><li>It's getting cold!  Three days ago we had 75 degree weather here in Houston.  Today and for the past couple days it's been icky wet and rainy like 45 degrees it seems.  We actually had to use the heater last night!</li>

<p><li>Amanda and I, both being "afraid" of committment, have committed to each other for 1 month.  It reminds me of the song "<a href="http://www.lyrics.ch/query/get?s=64289">Popular</a>" by Nada Surf</li>

<p><li>I'm doubly super excited about Flashnet and have made my <a href="http://www.flash.net/~robnugen">Flashnet</a> website even cooler!</li>
