<title>A Twisted Christmas</title>

<p class=date>30 December 1998</p>

<p><font face="arial">A TWISTED CHRISTMAS</font> read the card featuring red and white twisted glistening candy stripes. A rave on 26 December from 10pm to 6am and the first 500 people in the door get a free CD!

<p>Cool! So I drove home from my dad's and napped a bit until Amanda and Sally dropped by at 10 and we piled into Amanda's car and zipped away.. first to Walgreen's to get ear plugs which turned out to be quite useful.

<p>The line was not huge but significant out the door of Club Waxx downtown. I was much happier bouncier in line than previous raves; it was my third rave or so, but the first one that I actually went <em>with</em> someone and therefore already knew someone in line.

<p>(this entry is going way too slow)

<p>We got in a got free CDs and this was Amanda and Sally's first rave so they weren't as ready to jump out into the middle of the circle and dance as I was. Sally got a few action shots of me doing my patented "I don't know what the heck I'm doing except I'm having fun" dance.

<p>Amanda got a call from her friend Jen, who was going to join us at some point, so she left to go meet her and stuff. Sally and I watched people dance and watched the DJs spin records and were just chillin' when the music came to an abrupt halt.

<p>"Um, we're sorry to have to do this, but everyone who is 18 has to leave. The police are outside and everyone under 18 has to leave now."

<p>Hmmmm.

<p>Music resumed only to be interrupted with the same message plus, "if everyone who is under 18 doesn't leave now, we'll have to kick everyone out and check IDs"

<p>Hmmmm.

<p>Soon, that's what happened. They stamped our hands and kicked the entire rave out to simply go to the front and show IDs to get back in. Except that Sally's ID was in Amanda's car. Hmmmm.

<p>The whole process took a pretty long time and we met Lisa, Elliot, and Anu in line. Lisa was super thoughtful and gave Sally her jacket thing cause Sally had no sleeves on her outfit. We talked about tattoos and whatever until the line started moving. The dude wouldn't let Sally in without her ID, so we gave Lisa her jacket back and went looking for Amanda and Jen.

<p>At this point it was like 1am and somewhat chilly outside. We didn't find her car in the parking lot but reached her on cell phone. Turns out they had driven up and saw everyone outside and Jen didn't feel comfortable going in--didn't feel like she would fit in.

<p>After some encouragement and promises to leave if she felt too uncomfortable, we all went in. Yay! Found Lisa and Elliot and introduced everyone and danced some more. By about 2 something AM 
my knee was a bit sore so I went and sat down and actually took a nap (thanks to my earplugs) until Amanda and them were ready to go a bit before 3am.

<p>To Biba's we went (the third time I've been there recently) and chilled and talked and had a super funny fun time. As a side note, Matt Maloney of the Houston Rockets and some of his friends were there. We didn't say HI or anything.
