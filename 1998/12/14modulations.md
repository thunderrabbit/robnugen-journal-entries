<title>modulations</title>

<p class=date>Monday 14 December 1998</p>
<br>(day 10491)

<p>Last night Manda and I saw the movie _Modulations_.  From their <a href="http://www.modulations.com">website</a>: "Modulations traces the evolution of electronic music as one of the most profound artistic developments of the 20th century."

<p>Modulations was certainly super rad; it made me really really want to go check out a rave *NOW* but I had no idea where one might be on Sunday night.  It was just about the right mix of sound/light vs technical and historical documentary, but I would have liked more (and louder) on the soundtrack part.  They didn't go too much into the minds of the rave crowds, but described pretty thoroughly the music.  Like where "house music" started and why it's called that.  And how the British scene changed and resulted in the creation of jungle music. 

<p>(I'm not giving away the answers (unless you ask) so I won't ruin the movie for you)

<p>They had lots of interviews of different djs and magazine writers.  I only knew a 2 of the names: dj spooky and invisible skratch picklz

<p>If the rave scene or electronic music intrigues you, go check out the film.
