<title>Little Rock Rally</title>

<p class=date>4-6 December 1998</p>

<p>Leaving Houston at 9:30am, I drove kT Hammons and Nicole Mauldin up to Tulsa to pick up Frank Roesler and Eryn Pope.  I had forgotten to get a map to the Tulsa church, but we stopped by a McDonald's and used their phone book and figured it out.

<p>Said HI to Ashley Robinson, Stacey Craig, and a couple others after I took a quick nap at the Tulsa church. Then we were on our way after a quick stop at Wendy's for food.

<p>Frank cracked me up and I almost snarfed with his hilarious beat box sounds. Had to be there.

<p>Got to Little Rock at about midnight.  Signed in and hugged and said HI to everyone and opening circle Matt and Mari Mock and Gene Hudnall and Nick Gruenewald made all the announcements and stuff.  A game of Mafia followed, and it was super cool because we who were Mafia, happened to all be right next to each other in the circle!  (Except for 1 person who we killed first)

<p>It was me, Eryn Pope, Bryan Beck, Danny K, and uh oh.. I'm in trouble. I don't remember who else was mafia.  Mafia won, since Bryan volunteered himself to die and threw off the whole group.

<p>Then I did sleep sleep sleep almost through breakfast and then watched Pulp Fiction and then hung out on the porch with Bryan and Eryn near JoEllen's spirituality workshop.  Aaron Ivener showed up with one of his friends a chatted for a bit.

<p>Yoga workshop then massage workshop, where I volunteered to be massaged by the woman doing the workshop. Yay!

<p>Eryn and I played with Jenga blocks, seeing how high we could stack them.  Then a dude whose name I forgot brought a bunch of drums and stuff and taught us some beats and a dance and all kinds of fun.

<p>Then Nick G stacked up the Jenga blocks in the highest stack we had been able to do and we took some pictures of it.  I went to bed, but apparently he placed one of those black music stands on top of it!  There are rumors that he got a picture of it, and other rumors that it fell off and hit him on the head first.

<p>Slept through talent show (sorry, guys) and no Silent Football (you could have played without me!) and woke up at 4am for a brief walk around the church then back to bed for a few hours.

<p>Slept through cleanup and then we snagged breakfast and closing circle sang Yogi Bear and good friends and stuff.

<p>Bright yellow covers on the mugbooks, but I've lost mine before I could put it in the Big Gray Rally Book. Pooh.  Wonderful fun rally!
