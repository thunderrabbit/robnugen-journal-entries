Since I posted this, I've had a few people inquire about where to 
find this lovely CD.  Here is my answer:

The CD is only available at <a href="http://www.recordrack.com">Record Rack</a> in Houston.  
Bruce, the owner of Record Rack, used to own
Numbers where the DJ worked who made the CD.  It's a compilation CD
made by DJ wES wALLACE

Email Bruce and see if there are any more available. I
bought it in like 1998 I think...  He will happily
ship one to you.

<p>To be honest, I didn't actually recognize that I knew the Nitzer Ebb song, but all the others I recognized as songs I love!

<p>I was so excited because they are all the exact mixes that I remember ('cept for <em>Halloween</em>), which was cool because I had previously found a CD with "Looking From a Hilltop" on it and I bought the CD, but it was a different mix! Argh!

<p>*AND* it includes the <b>Airplane Crashers</b> song, which I have wanted for a super long time, but it's been out of print!

<p>I nostalgically (sp) listened through all the songs before I bought it with a super happy smile on my face.  I actually would have gotten it just for Airplane Crashers, but all of them were perfect.  I didn't mind that Ministry was a mix because I have a copy of it on a <em>Halloween</em> single.


<p>Enough about that.  Oh wait! I also bought <b>Beastie Boys</b> <em>hello nasty</em> poster, the one with the three of them in the sardine tin.

<p>I sold another Flashnet account to Jeffrey, a guy who works at Kinko's where I got my Flashnet business cards made!

<p>While chatting with Jen on ICQ, I happened to remember a <a
href="/writing/old/funny_classics/margins.html">self-referential</a>
newsgroup posting. When I looked at it, there were only 7 hits on its
counter!!!  I think it's funny enough to deserve more hits than that,
so go check it out!  If you don't like it, <a
href="mailto:rob@robnugen.com">email me</a>.

<p>Tomorrow I'm going skating in the morning with my friend Ben. It's been a long time since we've been skating together.

<p>Fred, my brother, wants a daily desk calendar with a word for each day of 1999.  Wende, my ex-girlfriend still good friend, loves Winnie the Pooh.  I bought Fred the calendar he wanted, and a Pooh calendar for Wende.  So?  So I switched the boxes and wrapped them that way.

<p>Fred will not be too excited about Pooh, nor will Wende about a word per day.  I hope I'm there to see them both open 'em!
