<title>Christmas 1998</title>

<p class=date>30 December 1998</p>

<p>OH MY GOODNESS it's almost 1999.

<p>1999 1999 1999. Crazy. 1999 1999. 1999. sorry. I'm just practicing typing it.

<p>I had a super fun Christmas timeframe - went to my mom's in College Station on Christmas Eve. My brother Fred drove down from Denton as well. Spirits were delightful and fun with our two step sisters, Alicia and Karina (who I've known since wayyyy before there was any hint of us becoming step siblings) and their dad (Jon (that guy)) and his sister and their dad.. it was a small reunion! Oh and Karina's boyfriend Jay.

<p>Coolest thing was the "rubik's" cube Fred purchased. Remember the Rubik's Cube? 3x3x3 pristinely colored cube that one can render into a cube of confetti with just a few turns?
<br>Well, Fred found and purchased a 5x5x5 cube! Oh yes. It is amazing.

<p>If you are as geeky as us, you can get one via

<p>Certainly there's a URL, but I don't know what.

<p>Okay, I found a URL: <a href="http://www.puzzletts.com/search/">http://www.puzzletts.com/search/</a> and type in <font face="arial">professor's</font> for the name and it will come right up!

<p>So anyway the cube was super awesome and I pretty much played with that the whole 2 days we were there. We also watched "The Wrong Trousers" starring Wallace and Grommit, who I had never previously seen except on Mario's desk as little plastic figures. Yup Wallace, Grommit, penguin and trousers. That's hilarious stuff! I loved the train track scene. How do they make the background blur if it's stop action photography? I was quite impressed.

<p>On the morning of the 26th, Fred and I cruised to our dad's house and hung out there for the day, mostly doing computer nerd stuff as Fred has brought his scanner and printer and CD rom burner. Also invited my friend Super Dave Osborne over. He was my best friend during high school and we just walked around outside and reminisced and philosophized and climbed trees and stuff.

<p>In all, 'twas a delightful night before through day after Christmas.
