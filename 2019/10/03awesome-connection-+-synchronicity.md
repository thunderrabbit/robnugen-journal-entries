Wandering a bit aimlessly, I discovered there's a lounge where certain
customers can chill and maybe get food and drinks..  I am apparently
not one of those customers, so I don't know!

Rejected, but not too dejected, I noticed an information booth so went
to talk to them.  I found out exactly what kind of customer is allowed
(over 50,000 miles), but she wasn't able to look up the mileage I have
since I am flying on a different airline.

Turned around and noticed a cool little exhibit type thing where we
can create wood block prints at no charge!  Wow!  Perfect gift for
Colleen, and with the perfect timing: I had just enough time to make
the print before boarding started on my flight!
