Yay Colleen for adulting me safely to the airport!  As we gave huge
hugs at the drop off area, we joked about adulting and I asked her to
let me know if she figures it out!

Great to see a snippet of her life in Seattle.

I wrote bye to Colleen as I was on the jetway, but it did not go
through because apparently no wifi there.

Flight departure prep now.

The in-flight TV system had to be rebooted or something, and it was
neat to watch as each seat's TV got a separate DHCP connection to the
server.  I could see them slowly progressing from front to back of
plane.

There are some sisters on my row (spread across the aisle) and their
mom in seat diagnally in front of me.  Sisters had some sort of hand
signal communication which brought back memories.
