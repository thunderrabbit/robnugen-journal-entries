I'm on a bus!  I'm on a bus!  Everyone, look at me; I'm on a nearly
empty bus, headed to Narita, headed to Seattle to see Colleenie Bean
Dawg for a day doing touristy things in the city and then having pizza
at their crib.

(The bus is now waiting at a light like 5 minutes from my house.  So
funny how transit works on this planet.)
