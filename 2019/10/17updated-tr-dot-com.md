I added the poem written by Brise Lively on
https://thunderrabbit.com

I wasn't able to find the library by clicking around in the links, but
I put the poem in the
library.

I have considered removing this website to Hugo, just so I won't have
to worry about updating MediaWiki.  But getting rid of
mediawiki means people would have to learn git to help update the site.
