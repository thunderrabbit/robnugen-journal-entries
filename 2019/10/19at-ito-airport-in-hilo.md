Lin and I are chillin' next to Gate 6 in ITO airport.

It took about 15 minutes to wait in line to turn in our rental vehicle
at Thrifty, but then just 5 minutes to turn it in.

I have been informed twice that I have to wear shoes to board the
aircraft.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I am sure I can board safely with
or without shooooeeess.

##### 07:14 HA 121 (on plane)

yay I did not have to wear shoes.

##### 09:13 HNL Honolulu airport gate G 4

Due to an equipment change, Lin and I do not have our seats next to
each other.  So far, we have not gotten them back together, but I am optimistic.

9:19 am: done!  Seats 42K and 42L.
