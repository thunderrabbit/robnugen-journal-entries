Good morning!

I got a surprise from Vimeo this morning.

    Dear Rob Nugen,
    
    Your account has been removed by the Vimeo Staff for violating our Guidelines.
    
        Reason: You cannot upload rips of movies, music, television, viral
        videos, or any other content that you did not create.
    
    For more information on our content and community policies, please
    visit: https://vimeo.com/guidelines.	 If you believe this was an
    error, please reply to this message as soon as possible to
    explain. (Please be aware that Vimeo moderators take action as
    violations come to our attention. “I see other people doing it” is not
    a valid explanation.)
    
    Otherwise, we hope that you find a video platform better suited to
    your needs.
	
       Sincerely,
       Vimeo Staff

My reply:

    Hello
    
    I have been informed that my account has been terminated due to
    violating your Guidelines.  It would be easier to defend myself if you
    tell me which video is in violation.
    
    But here is my defense:   I don't upload stuff I don't create.
    
    I have been working on Marble Track 3 for years, and have uploaded
    some same videos on my YouTube account and my Vimeo account in the
    process of considering actually using Vimeo for my main content.
    
    I guess your bots detected identical videos on both platforms?  No
    that couldn't be it.  Is there a bit of music in the background of one
    video?  Maybe, but it's not the focus of any of my videos.
    
    Again, let me know what video it was, and we can discuss a better way
    to go forward than terminating my account.
    
    My main proof, without knowing what your bots found: I don't live for
    fake internet points.  I only upload stuff I make.
    https://www.marbletrack3.com 
    
    Ohhh maybe your bots caught repetition in two of my own videos?? 
    Marbletrack3 is a stop motion video which takes hours to make even a
    single second of content.  I have uploaded clips that are increasingly
    longer as I work on the project.
    
    See my YouTube channel for what I mean http://channel.marbletrack3.com
    
    Best regards
    Rob
    
    And PS I just signed up for PRO, so I'd like my money back if you
    going to terminate my account.
    
    PS PS just to prove I, Rob Nugen, control marbletrack3.com I will post
    this on the site:

Hi Rob, 

Your account was terminated for violating Vimeo's Terms of Service (https://vimeo.com/terms).

Vimeo does not allow you to upload videos ripped from TV, movies, or anywhere else. The golden rule of Vimeo is that you are only permitted to upload videos that you created. The video titled "[just my feet](http://feet.robnugen.com)" was the clip found in violation of our guidelines. 

We’re happy to provide a list of your videos, which we’ll send to the primary address on your account. The file you receive will contain the following information:

* Video ID
* Video title
* Number of plays
* Number of likes
* Download link

&lt;snip>

I've also gone ahead and issued a refund of your Vimeo Plus subscription. Please allow 3-5 business days for the funds to post to your account. 

Please let us know if you have any questions!

Sincerely,
Dan R.

Hi Dan

Thank you for your reply.

Ah, yes, I can understand "Just My Feet" is in violation. 

Can we remove that video, consider me educated, and reinstate my account?

My focus now is Marble Track 3, not old TV shows I was on.

Best,
Rob
