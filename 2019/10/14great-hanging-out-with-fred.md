Thanks to Maggie for putting me and Fred up in a hotel near the
airport.  Free airport shuttle whisked me to the correct terminal and
I went through security with my belt on (no worries)!  I was surprised
they didn't notice, but I didn't notice either until I was all they
way through the hands-over-head X ray thing.  Thanks, security
theater!
