Nice nice so nice awesome first time to do facilitation during
ShadowWork Basic Facilitation Training.  This is the first container I
have been in that I have been in with women facilitators as my peers.
Quite a different experience for me.

Rachel and I facilitated first today, facilitating our courageous
person who was willing to be the first participant.
