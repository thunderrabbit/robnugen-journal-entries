Nico and I went to Kroger for lunch at the salad bar area, which is
next to a cheese island where a woman named Karina was working.  She
is apparently a native Spanish speaker, but does not spell her name as
"Carina."

Nico and I are back in the house now and he has just been practicing
how to say "Howdy Y'all" and got a cheer from the crowd when he got it
just perfect.

It makes me think of Tomoko.
