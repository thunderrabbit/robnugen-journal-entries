Today was the last day of training, so tomorrow starts the first day
of practice.  Rachel and I are going first.

Tonight several of us went to Walmart (where I got stickers for
Tomoko),

then Wendy's (where DeeDee got five (5) free Frosty coupons
because their machine was down (and there were five of us)), then
Sonic (to which Nico had never been).

Afterward, best time saying HI to Rachel's family via Skype
equivalent, then singing songs, including Grease "Tell me More"

Falling alspee.

I will just leave that as I am falling asleep.
