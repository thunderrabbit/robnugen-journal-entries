At the recreation area, I quickly migrated to the climbing equipment.
No slides or bridges between things; just dense with lots of ropes,
curved seats, and stuff, all of which was supported by poles at
different angles.

At each end of the set, they had an angled thing that spun, and I was
able to get my bodyweight to spin around it, but just once or twice.
