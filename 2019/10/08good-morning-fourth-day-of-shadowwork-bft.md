This is the beginning of day four of the 9 day Basic Facilitator
Training for ShadowWork.

I cried a bit this morning as I was waking up, thinking about how much
shame I have loaded onto myself for so many years.  Also tears for how
I have hurt people in the past.  In my imagination, I wondered about
recording the work I do this week.  The first questions out of the way
(checking for physical limitations or concerns about the environment),
I will be asked what I want to have happen here today.  I plan to say
I want to stop (mentally) sexualizing every (most) relationship(s) I
have with women.  This behavior does not serve me, and apparently
stems from not loving myself enough.

I texted Mark, Christine, and Demi about bringing this work to Tokyo.
I should text Rin, Hiro, and Soness as well.

    Sonessy!  The training here has been great beyond my expectations.
    
    I think this type of work will be better suited in Japan than the
    Mankind Project work I have been doing.
    
    I want to bring some trainers into Japan to lead a ShadowWork weekend.
    Both men and women can do the work together, so I believe it will be
    easier to find enough people who'd be interested in attending.

    I am not yet half way through this training, but I am already thinking
    about how I can do the second training and subsequent trainings.
