We have arrived at a house in Pahoa that we hope is Robert's.  He had
to leave for a meeting just about 20 minutes before we arrived.  I got
a bit lost along the way.

The house is great, stocked with fruit, and other necessities, and has
beautiful hardwood floors in the common area and the three bedrooms.
Lin chose the master bedroom which has attached bathroom.
The other two bedrooms share a bathroom.
