We are leaving 69 Beach in Kona after chilling out there a few hours.
I walked barefoot on a rocky outcropping which I found more
challenging than the average outcropping due to the jagged igneous
edges.

We stayed under some trees which provided nice shade and climbing.

I found the water a bit cold, but the locals said it was warm. Hmmm.
