It doesn't have all the junk it had before, but it is created by
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) served on
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), with the last step being to point
robnugen.com DNS records to Netlify servers.  Check Netlify docs for
how to do that https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/#manual
