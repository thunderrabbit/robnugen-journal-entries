This morning Colleen woke me up at 6:40 as I hoped to leave by 7am for
the airport.  I was shocked to know Ryan had already left; I didn't
notice him at all while I was sleeping.

I am grateful that Colleen woke me up after I had not set an alarm or
anything; I was just able to conk out asleep last night and she
handled all the details.

Traffic was super smooth toward the airport and smooth experience from
baggage check-in out on the curb to quite polite TSA agents in through
the gates.  Thank you, SEA-TAC!
