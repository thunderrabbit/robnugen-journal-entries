I chose not to go out to dinner with them to Ninfa's tonight.  Pretty
much super tired and need to sleep, but it may have been good to go so
I would be forced more onto this timezone.

I plan to go buy candles at Kroger, but not sure when I will.

Today went by super slow at first with a bunch of theory, but then
when it got to the practice, everyone was like "whoah" with questions
and head proverbially spinning.

Super great to see John and Rhonda.
