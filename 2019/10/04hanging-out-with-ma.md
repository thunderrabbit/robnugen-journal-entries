Ma came to the baggage claim area to wait for me!  We took the subway
(subterrainian electric vehicle that ran on rails that looked
relatively light) to the hotel and got some food there.  I marveled at
the size of the portions, <!-- and smiled at Meghan's braces, --> but
there was no in-flight meal so I finished what we ordered.

The veggie burger tasted somewhat like raw meat.  Not sure if I would
have enjoyed it if I thought it was real meat.

Ma and I did some real talk about when she and Dad divorced, so that
was nice.

She told me about a play that Jon is in, where his character actually
sits in the audience and interrupts the play near the end.

That sounds amazing, so I hope I can watch it sometime.

I am tired and writing this while sleepy; I am going to take a shower
and go to bed.  I do not have wifi access yet, so will have to take
care of that in the morning.
