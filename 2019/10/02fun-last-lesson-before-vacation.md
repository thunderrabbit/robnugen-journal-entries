Hide and Akiko from 7pm class each needed to make up some lessons, so
stayed for the 8pm class featuring Misato and Tatsuya.

I think it worked pretty well; they had not met each other, and they
are all pretty much similar personalities so I figured they would get
along fine.

After self intros, most of the time they talked about Akiko's challenging business trip
to Hydrabad, India.  Most of the rest of the time we talked about Hide's work.
