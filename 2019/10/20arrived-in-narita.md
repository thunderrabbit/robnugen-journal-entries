Our plane has landed back in Narita.

The flight itself was fine, though the screen on the seat in front of
her stopped being entertaining, even though it is supposed to be
in-flight entertainment.  The cabin attendants tried to reset it but
were not able to fix it so they gave her a voucher and a bottle of
wine.

In an attempt to get myself back on Tokyo time, I tried to stay up
during the flight. I watched John Wick 3, part of an episode of Fresh
Prince of Bellaire, an episode of Simpsons, Dark Angel (X-Men), and
John Wick.

I'm a bit bummed my phone is dead; hopefully its insurance will cover
it.

We're on a bus.  We're on a bus.  Everyone look at us, we're on a mfn bus.
