We went to Uncle Robert's tonight and I can see why it's the happenin'
place to be each week.  Before we browsed the food and various
souvenirs and services, we went to the ocean side where I stacked a
few rocks in my version of the Hawaiian style.

We quickly saw Shawn (sp) and Ashley (sp) from
[Nicoco](https://nicocohawaii.com/) but somehow forgot to buy any
gelato from them!

I spent some time listening to
[Andrew M Crusoe](https://www.amazon.com/Andrew-M-Crusoe/e/B00AFZFK14)
talk about some of his books, but didn't buy any (at first).

Saw a man with a typewriter offering to write poetry on any topic in
exchange for any offering.  I gave him 1000 yen for the following
poem which he wrote after I gave him the topic "Thunder Rabbit":

    Thunder Rabbit
    
    The thump of your leg causes cataclysmic quakes, making the earth
    shake with the vibrance of your being.  The predators of the
    forest think you easy prey, but if they hunt you they won't live
    to see another day for the thunder rabbit doesn't play.
    
    You will shake in the wake make no mistake, and definitely don't
    take my cuteness for granted.

via PayPal.  I have not been able to pay him because my PayPal account
wants me to verify my phone which passed away today due to having
gotten wet.

I owe Andrew $10 via PayPal.
