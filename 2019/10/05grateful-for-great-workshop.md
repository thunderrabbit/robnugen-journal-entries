This is the first time I have written about doing candle magic, which
I learned from
[Dean Ramsden](http://deanramsden.com/the-activation-use-of-the-magical-mind-online-class/).
Tonight I walked to the grocery store to get candles that I could use
to perform a magic ritual (?) for ensuring the workshop and this whole
trip continue to be fantastic for me, all the way through.

In other news, I have really truly almost got my site working again.

This time the machine name will be www.  I will forward all pages from
new. to www.
