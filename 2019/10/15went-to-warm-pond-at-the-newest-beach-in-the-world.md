Yesterday, while Lynn was sleeping, I took this picture of the cat outside our
balcony.  Later, Lynn asked if it was a wild cat.  I said all cats think they
are wild.

Afterward, Robert took us to the newest beach in the world.  Apparently
this area used to be ocean, but after the eruption, tons of small lava
rocks were washed up into this cove which used to be ocean.  Somehow
home two small pools were not filled in and they remain as pools.

Yay for my underwater phone camera!

Robert recognized one of his friends in the same pond and their kids
were bit smitten with François.

I got François back and pose for a shop on this tree.

This picture shows a boat ramp going into this relatively tiny pond.
Now why would that be??

I am standing on what used to be ocean!

Afterwards, we went shopping and I liked this funny sign that spoke of
disaster before.
