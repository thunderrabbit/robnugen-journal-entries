Today will be my third lesson out of 12 at BP for their current course
on presentation skills.  It's been challenging, with 12 students and a
wide range of English ability.  Fortunately, they all know each other
and are all doing their best.  That helps a lot!

But first, two hours of lessons at SCC.  These lessons are technically
more challenging, but then again easier because I just work with one
student at a time, so it's easy to tailor the material for each student.
