Going barefoot allows you to open up the senses with the trigger like a sudden shock to the system that allows you to realize that you have nerves on your feet. This in fact it allows you to connect with all of the nerves in your system. In fact you can create the New neural pathways that allow you to be more focused in aware of the present moment including your physical body and the earth and your surroundings.

Using this as a beginning point we can allow participants to get a greater sense of where they are in the world and what they previously were not aware of in the past.  This can include guidance from inner knowing and if you believe in it guidance from spiritual beings.

I do believe in this spiritual guidance because why the hell not,and by believing there is something who's working on my behalf behind-the-scenes it helps me be more optimistic that I only need to take care of the things that are right here in front of me and I can take care of.

I don't need to worry about the stuff that doesn't affect me.  Being barefoot keeps me keenly focused on this present moment and this physical body.  Time and time again I see people with their nose buried in smart phone or chatting in phone with her friend and tons of world outside being ignored. and while that's fine And everyone can make their own choice.I also think there's value in having knowledge awareness of where I am physically in the world and what in the world is around me at the moment.. At this moment.

There is no end. Literally no end to the amount of data one can consume on YouTube. There something like 400 hours of videos uploaded every minute. https://everysecond.io/youtube you Literally cannot consume it all. So why not give yourself a break. Be present in this moment This breath and this body, these feet, and this connection to mother earth.  Modern society tends to protect us from anything that might be possibly oainful and then the end that actually causes more pain.

Crunched up pinky toes stinky feet sweat taking off shoes at the end the day it's gross that causes bad posture.  I'm not a doctor and I don't pretend to be one, but I wasn't born with shoes on.  and back in the day they didn't have shoes at all .  And for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years everyone was just fine thank you very much.

Why is it now than modern man can't engage with nature anymore?  Notice your surroundings notice your physical body. While we're at it let's notice the breath use this newfound physical awareness to jump start your attention to your breath.  Inspiration and respiration words come from the same root word of the spirit because breath is life.  Without the breath we will die.  Without awareness of the breath we die mentally. by not being aware of what we are living, how we are living ?   Consumed by our gadgets and stuck in virtual reality.

Come back to this reality. Come back to this present moment. Come back to your self and your internal power. Your internal guidance system knows what It needs to be doing. It knows how to handled itself. It's designed that way.  And if you don't want to take your shoes off or you can't take your shoes off, No worries.  Take care of yourself this is not for everyone but it's for people who are courageous enough to try something new and willing to take a risk, willing to choose.  Be active positive, Excited exciting life, And connected to the present moment. Instead of stuck inside shoes with your feet all numbed out bored.  Don't you think your feet get bored.? Those nerves are literally dying for something to do.

Have you heard of shiatsu?  This ancient system says there are nerve endings on the bottom of the peace that corresponds all of the major organs and in major systems in the body..  By walking around barefoot, I receive free shiatsu from mother Earth including all of the accompanying electron ions that rubber soled shoes so effectively block.

Do you know Netflix competitor?  Literally anything else that you might be doing besides watching Netflix.  Now I don't know if that's literally true, but it's that type of competition that your life is competing with.  Literally anything else then your body and its own natural processes that have kept you alive all this time.  Why is it that we allow ourselves to be competing against the unrelenting deluge of the Internet?  this deluge of delusion?  If we don't take back some personal space for ourselves then we are just going to be lost in the never-ending ever-increasing torrent of information and misinformation.  Strictly speaking not all of it is true and not all of it is helpful.  How can you develop the ability to discern what is true for you except by practicing discerning what is true in your body what's true for you in your inner world based on what is in the (physical) world around you?

Give yourself at least a chance to be present to your own reality.  Give yourself a chance to be present in your own life and your own movie.  We're not on Truman show though it may seem like that's sometimes.  Each of us creating ourselves up as the star of our own social media empire..  What about your internal empire?  By focusing so much energy outward what are we missing on the inside?  What do we need to take time to accept, or appreciate, or to see in a whole new way?

The never ending stream of vitriol on Twitter.. It's never going to end don't make yourself fight it and be too tired until the end unless that's your purpose in life to be tired?

How are you going to know your purpose in life if you don't even know what is true and active in your life?  Allow yourself the space and time to get to know yourself.   You get To know your purpose..  Getting to know yourself will allow you to be your own best friend.  Can you accept all parts of yourself?  Don't you want acceptance from the friends around you?  How can you accept yourself if you don't even know yourself?  With my simple five-step program (*), get to know who you are and accept you are in all your perfectly imperfect glory.  (* program to be created)

Being aware of your emotions is critical to navigating through life.  Navigating through relationships and family and work and school..  Your emotions are like a guidance system that is telling you what your physical body needs in this moment.  Do you feel anger?  You need space.  Do you feel sadness?  You need time to grieve. Do you feel shame?  This is a chance to accept yourself.  You need acceptance.  Acceptance from yourself.

Do you feel fear?  You need information.  Let me help you navigate your emotions and be aware of what's happening in her internal world.  Some guy wrote recently in his blog after coaching hundreds of people, “We’re all just big, complicated bags of emotion walking around.”   https://leowid.com/2019-2

Some people have the emotions compressed down so tightly that it sometimes and burst out its rage uncontrollable.  How do we begin to deal with that?  How do we begin to approach that in ourselves?   it can be a scary process.  You need a competent and trusted guide who knows the lay of the land, Who has been there before with hundreds of others.  Leading my Peer counseling circles has given me vast amounts of experience in navigating this territory.  Do you need someone to hear you?  I can be that.  Do needs someone to represent the energy of your father?  Your mother?   Your boss? Your brother or sister your employee?  I can be that.  I can hear your rough draft of what you want or plan to say. I can ask you the questions that help you see how to move forward with the situation.

We're all just big bags of emotion, and that's okay.  Notice how our emotions are patient, and they will be with us our entire life because they are part of us.  How our emotions are part of us and that energy is patient. If you do not take care of your emotions, the energy will wait for literally ever or manifest into some physical problem.  I realize this in high school after I had tried to be brave and not cry at my Granddad's funeral several years prior and then when I smelled his old jacket I suddenly burst into tears at the loss.  Where had that sadness been for those intervening years?

I knew then and there that for some reason emotions must be important.  At the time I didn't know why, but the importance of navigating emotions has become readily apparent in my life.  It has saved me so many times to be able to face a person who's exhibiting great anger at me and I can react calmly.  Even in cases when that person may be in the wrong, it allows me to have the patience to ultimately prevail as I don't get caught up in their anger or into their story.  I hear their anger, I allow myself to have a psychic shield in front of me, and I let that anger go and ground straight into the earth.  I don't allow it to touch me, because I know what the end of the day, their anger has nothing to do with me.   And likewise my anger at people or my wife has nothing to do with her.  I know this, And for a long time I knew it theoretically, but I still wasn't able to process my anger internally, and allow it to be transmuted into something more powerful.  Now I can feel my anger come up and count for a few seconds and process my way through it, then continue the conversation with my wife after either parking the anger or allowing it to be transmuted into something greater that supports us  both.

I'm just learning this process of transmutation and I'm not sure I know how to teach it yet but I judge it is a spiritual process And helps me untangle karma and prevent creation of future karma that would be the result of acting in an unhelpful way.  Treating every person as if they are literally God is another way to think about this.  There was a man who said "God Dwells in Me as Me", And though he may have been burned for it, I think he was onto something.  Jesus wasn't the literal son of God any more or less than you or I are.  He may have been an enlightened being, and there have been loads of them throughout the ages.  Not all of them are as high-profile as Mohammed or Buddha or the others I can't think of, But all of them talk to you same essential message. That Love is the key and we have all the love we need.  Just like the recent Rick and Morty episode said, Love is boundless and infinite.  It is we who imprisoned ourselves by believing the messages that we ended up taking on as coping mechanisms as children.  Get in touch with yourself by meditating or walking barefoot or eye gazing.  They're all different routes to the same thing.  Internal peace and happiness.  Do your personal work. Do your emotional work.  Allow yourself to become aware of who you are.

I am fascinated with time, and love to play with it in different ways.  I create stop motion animation. I take pictures of construction projects over time.  I have been journaling since 1985. Since 1996 online. https://bitbucket.org/thunderrabbit/robnugen-journal-entries/ Time inextricably moves forward. And yet actually doesn't change at all.  Skipping all the stuff about relativity that's beyond my little brain, I have much more down-to-earth things that I do with time.  I have two best friends. One best friend who will do anything for me.  Another best friend for whom I'll do anything.  You've probably heard this one before. But the one that does anything for me is my past self and the one who I will do anything for us is my future self.  At least that's the idea that I like to flesh out more.  Another way to look at it is as a manager in a small company.  I have a boss and I have an employee.  My boss is my past self telling me what to do, And my employee is my future self who I tell what to do.

Or maybe my past self was my employee didn't do what he supposed to do, And I have to clean up for him becauseI'm the boss and I don't want my future boss to get mad at me.  

One little game I played with this is the idea of micromanaging.  I don't like it when my boss micromanages me. And so I shouldn't micromanage my employees.  In this time game, that looks like not getting too caught up on the never ending lists that old me wrote in the past, Now I try writing lists only gently to my future self. so has a chance to have some free time once the future becomes now.

For fun, I have been writing an interview backwards.  It's a long story, but the interview is of a myself as an author who's written a book about several characters. Due to the confines of the format and time, I am writing the book backwards. https://bitbucket.org/thunderrabbit/robnugen-journal-entries/commits/ Actually I haven't added the book yet, but I am working on the interview of the author who is being interviewed after the book was written.  It's super confusing, but it's one example of how I like to play with time.  Sometimes it's a full week between posting single words of the interview.  Sometimes it's a whole week between single frames of my stop motion animation.  But at the end of the day, at the end of the project all of that time that the project took simply melts away into literal nothingness and isn't even visible to the future viewers viewing the book for the video

There's one more weird thing about life and times that I've noticed.  Have you ever read a biography of your most favorite famous person?  Even if they're pooping out albums or books every year, it still takes a whole year to do it.  They're just people who have their own life and their own problems.  It's okay to give yourself some time to do stuff.  Einstein did like one thing in his life.  And it took him fucking ages to figure it out.  Allow yourself the gift of time. Allow yourself some time to let your unconscious mind do the work.  Let your unconscious mind make the connections between things.  Let your magical mind drive things behind-the-scenes.  Allow it to tell yourself to turn left when usually you turn right.  How are you going to hear the call unless you have a quiet mind? 
 Practice being aware of yourself.  It all starts with being barefoot or being present in some other way.

One of the participants of my first eye gazing workshop came out from it and said "now I know who I am."  If that's not an amazing result, I don't know what is.  The sign above the door at the Oracle's house and Matrix said "know thyself."  Before the movie Matrix. "Know thyself" has been around a lot longer than that.  When Jimi Hendrix played the Star-Spangled Banner he was lost in the moment he literally gave himself time play, and play he did.  People go nuts when they see someone who's living in the moment in realtime actually really truly being their present form in that moment.  Being in the zone, being in the flow, being able to lift a car off of an accident victim because all of my power is here, Center right in this exact moment right now.  That's the power of the human body that's the power that I'm talking about. That's the power that's ready for you to contact me if you can just get your fucking nose out of your book feel your breath for a moment.  

As I'm free styling these words, believing in the faith of my editor to look at them and sort everything out. I hope he's in the flow in that moment just connecting with the words in connecting with  his inner guidance and being able to connect with the language.  It's chaos here. You should see it.

Now allow your inner world to be chaos.  Allow yourself time to sort yourself out.  Give yourself support to support yourself out. Let me be that person for you who knows how to dive down into the chaos in finding gold that is down there been buried all of these years under the misunderstandings of the small child trying to figure out this place in a crazy world.  It's not the child's fault the world is crazy, but it was his *problem*, and  please understand he did the very best he can. Take a moment to look back on your inner child and bless yourself by accepting him.  Give yourself the gift of digging down into the emotions that have been there since the emotions couldn't be processed at that time that they were laid down due to a misunderstanding on the part of a small child or an adult who themselves didn't know any better.

* Don't put too much pressure on your future self cuz he's your best friend.  Don't micromanage his time. I am a boss to my future self and an employee of my former self.  don't micromanage or let yourself be micromanaged.
* Both the barefoot workshop and he high gazing workshop are ways to trigger an awareness of the inner self and inner world.  There are many ways to get there these are just two ways that I enjoy.

Take my next level workshops we will begin to explore what blocks you from achieving what you were meant to bring to the world.

We will look at the trauma that were formed at early age and Work through the emotions and allow your inner guidance to shine through.  To allow your inner gold to shine through.

今回初めてeye gazing workshopに参加しました。わたしにとってそれは不思議な体験でした。まず二人ずつペアになって、数分間お互いの目を見つめ合いました。最初は恥ずかしく、照れ笑いがあったりしましたが、慣れてくるとメディテーションのような感覚で、何か集中した静かな時間が流れていました。

何度か回数を重ねると、徐々に相手の顔に動物のような模様が見えたり、顔が変形したり変化が見られました。また、相手の奥底にある精神的な面に触れることができた気がしました。不安があったり、軸のような強い意志があるように感じたり、目を見るだけでなにかを感じ取れているような感覚がありました。最近では人の目をずっと見ると違和感や、不快な思いをする方もいて、目を見ると行動は現代社会の中で欠如しているように思います。目を見るだけで少し不思議な体験ができたことがとても興味深く、より多くの人と意見をシェアして、eye gazing がどのような効果をもたらすのか知りたいと思いました。

Taking stock in your life, being accountable for what you have done in the past starts with awareness of what you have now and are now as a result of the past.  Begin by being here now simply in this moment.

======== Two Best Friends ========

Imagine you have two best friends.  One is named Pat.  Pat has done a lot of great things for you.  Pat hasn't done everything that you wanted, but all in all Pat's come through pretty well.  Pat is not really the kind of person who wants anything, so you don't worry about it too much and just let Pat enjoy.

Now Fran is different.  Fran will do anything for you.  Fran's task list is full like a real go getter.  Fran's always working on all kinds of projects. 

Here's the weird thing though,  You have to decide everything that Fran is going to do.  Fran can never decide what to do.  It's a little bit weird but, If Fran's going to get everything done, so be it.

So you make lists for Fran and hope Fran will get them done.  Look over at Pat and it seems Pat has been idling for a bit too long.

You go up to Pat all "hey Pat, I see you haven't done that thing you said you would do."

"Well," Pat looks down and scuffs the dirt.  "I didn't have enough time."

"You had all the time in the world!  Just look at Fran!  Every minute accounted for!"

"Yeah Fran is pretty great..  I'm just, well, I'm sorry.  I got tired."

You shake your head in dismay.  How could this have happened?  How can
one best friend be so great and the other so.. disappointing?
