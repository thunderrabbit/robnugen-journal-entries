Going barefoot allows you to open up the senses with the trigger like a sudden shock to the system that allows you to realize that you have herbs on your feet. This in fact it allows you to connect with all of the nerves in your system. In fact you can create the New neural pathways that allow you to be moreFocused in aware of the present moment including your body physical body and the earth and your surroundings.

Using this as a beginning point we can allow participants to get tapeGreater sense of where they are in the world andWhatWhat they previously were not aware of in the passThis can includeGuidance fromInternode and if you believe in it guidance fromSpiritual beings.

I do believe in this spiritual guidance because why the hell not,And by believing there is somethingWho's working on my behalf behind-the-scenesIt helps me be more optimistic that I only need to take care of the things that are right here in front of me and I can take care of.

I don't need to worry about the stuff thatDoesn't affect me.  Being barefoot keeps me keenly focused on this present moment and this physical body.  Time and time again I see people with their nose buried inSpark phone or chatting with her friend. In well that's fine And everyone can make their own choice.I also think there's value in havingKnowledge of where I M physically in the world and what in the world is around me at the moment.. At this moment.

There is no end. Literally no end to the amount of data one can consume on YouTube.ThereSomething like 400 hours of videos uploaded every minute.  Literally cannot consume at all.So why not give yourself a break. Be present in this momentThis breath and knees he and his connection to mother earth.  Modern societyTends to protect us from anything that might bePossiblyPainfulAnd then the end that actually causes more pain.

Crunched up pinky toesStinky feet sweat taking off shoes at the end the dayIt's grossThat perches thatCause bad postureI'm not a doctor and I don't pretend to be oneButI wasn't born with shoes on them back in the day they didn't have shoes at allAnd for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years everyone was just fine thank you very much.

Why is it now than modern manCan't engage with nature anymore?  Notice your surroundings noticeNotice your physical body. While we're at itLet's notice the breathUse this newfound physical awareness to jump start your attention to your breath.  Inspiration and respiration HallCome from the same root wordOf the spiritBecause breath his lifeWithout the breath we will dieWithout awareness of the breath we dieMentally by not being aware ofWhatWhat we are living up how we are livingHerConsumed by our gadgets and stuck inVirtual reality.

Come back to this reality. Come back to this present moment. Come back to your self and your internal power. Your internal guidance system knows whatIt needs to be doing.It knows how toHandled itself. It's designed that way.  And if you don't want to take your shoes off for you can't take your shoes offNo worries.  Take care of yourself this is not for everyone but it's for people who are courageous enough to try something new andWilling to take a riskWilling to chooseHey active positiveExcited exciting lifeAnd connected toThe present moment. Instead ofStuck inside shoes with your feet all numbed out board.  Don't you think your feet get bored.? Those nerves areBegging for something to do.

Have you heard of shiatsu?  This ancient system says there are nerve endings on the bottom of the peace that corresponds all of the major organs and in major systems in the body..  By walking around barefoot, piracy free shiatsuFrom mother Earth including all of the accompanyingNegative ions that rubber soled shoes so effectively block.

Give yourself at least a chance to be present to your own reality.  Give yourself a chance toBePresent in your own life and your own movieWe're not on Truman show may seem like that's sometimesEach of us creatingHow ourselves up as the star of our own social media empire..  What about your internal empire?  By focusing so much energy out word what are we missing on the inside?  What do we need to take time to accept, or appreciate, orTo see you in a whole new way?

The never ending stream of vitriol onOn TwitterIt's never going to endDon't make yourselfFight it and beat tired until the end must that's your purpose in life

How are you going to know your purpose in life if you don't even knowWhat isActive in your life?  Allow yourself the space and time to get to know yourselfYou get To know your purpose..  Getting to know yourself will allow you to be your own best friend.  Can you accept all parts of yourself?  Don't you want that of the friends around you?  How can you accept yourself if you don't even know yourself?  With my simple five-step programGet to know who you are and accept you are in all your perfectly imperfect glory.

Being aware of your emotions isCritical to navigating through lifeNavigating throughRelationships and family and work andSchool..  Your emotions are likely guidance system that is telling youWhat are your physical body needs in this moment.  Do you feel anger?  You need space.  Do you feel sadness?  You need time to grieve. Do you feel shame?  This is a chance to accept yourselfYou need acceptance.  Acceptance from yourself.

Do you feel fear?  You need information.  Let me help you navigate your emotions and be aware of what's happening in her internal world.  Passed Some guy wrote recently in his blog after coaching hundreds of people, Everyone is just a big bag of emotions.  https://leowid.com/2019-2

Some people have the emotions compressed down so tightly that it sometimes and burst out its rage uncontrollable.  How do we begin to deal with that?  How do I begin to approach that in ourselves?  .Scary process  You need a competent and trusted guy who knows the lay of the land, Who has been there before withHundreds of others.  Leaving my P or counseling circlesHas given me vast amounts of experienceIn navigating this territory.  Do you need someone to hear you?  I can be thatDo needs someone to represent the energy of your father?  Your mother?   Your bossYour brother or sister your employee?  I can be thatI can Hear your rough draft of what to say. I can ask you the questions thatHelp youSee how to move forward with the situation.We're all just big bags of emotion, and that's okay.  How our emotions are patients and they will be with us our entire life because it's part us.  How are emotions are part of us and that energy is patient. If you do not take care of your emotions energy will wait for literally ever.  I realize this in high school after I had tried to be brave and not cry at my Granddad's funeral several years priorAnd then when I smelled his old jacket Suddenly burst into tears at the loss.  Where has that sadness been for those intervening years?

I knew then and there that for some reason emotions must be important.  At the time I didn't know why, Put the importance of navigating emotions asBecome readily apparent in my life.  It has saved me so many times to be up to face the person who's exhibiting great anger at me and I can react call me.  Even in cases when that person may be in the wrong, it allows me to Ultimately prevail as I don't get caught up in their anger into their story.  I hear their anger, I allow myself to have a psychic shield in front of me, and I let that anger and ground straight into the earth.  I don't want to touch me, because I know what the end of the day, their anger has nothing to do with me.   And likewise my anger at my wife has nothing to do with her.  I know this, And prolonged time I knew it theoretically, but I still wasn't able toProcess my anger in internally andAllow it to be transmuted into something more powerful.  Now I can feel my anger come up baconCount for a few seconds andProcess my way through it, ThenContinue the conversation with my wifeAfter either parking the anger orAllowing it toBe transmuted into something greater.

I'm just learning this process of transmutation and I'm not sure I know how to teach it yet but I judge it is a spiritual process And helps me untangle karma and prevent creation of future karma that willBe the result of acting in an unhelpful way.  Treating every person as if they are literally GodIs another way to think about this.  There was a man who said God Dwells in me as me, And though he may have been burned for it, I think he was going to something.  Jesus wasn't the literal son of God any more or less than you or I are.  He may have been an enlightened being, And there have been loads of them throughout the ages.  Not all of them are as high-profile as Mohammed or Buddha or the others I can't think of, But all of them talk to you same essential message. ThatLove is the keyAnd we have all the love we need.  Just like the recent Rick and Morty episode said, Love is boundless and infiniteIt is we who imprisoned ourselves by believing the messages that we ended up taking on as coping mechanisms as children.  Get in touch with yourself by meditating or walking barefoot or eye gazing.  They're all different routes to the same thing.  Internal peace and happiness.  Due your personal work. Do your emotional work.Allow yourself to become aware of who you are.

I am fascinated with time, and love to play with it in different ways.  I create stop motion animation. I take pictures of construction projects over time.  I have been journaling since 1985. Since 1996 online.  Time inextricably moves forward. And yet actually doesn't change at all.  Skipping all the stuff about relativity it's beyond my little brain, I have much more down-to-earth things that I do with time.  I have two best friends.One best friend who will do anything for meAnother best friend who I'll do anything.  You've probably heard this one before. But the one that does anything for me is my past self and the one who I will do anything for us with your yourself.  At least that's the idea that like to flesh out more.  Another way to look at it is as a manager in a big company.  Actually a small companyI have a boss and I have an employee.  My boss is my past self telling me what to do, And my employee is my future self who I tell what to do.

Or maybe my past self as my employee didn't do what he supposed to do, And I have to clean up for him becauseI'm the boss and I don't want my future boss to get mad at me.  

One little game I played with this is the idea of micromanaging.  I don't like it when my boss Michael manages me. And so I shouldn't micromanage my employees.  In this time game, That looks like not getting too caught up on theNever ending lists that I wrote in the past, In writing lists only gently so my future self. has a chance to have some free time once the future becomes now.

For fun, I have been writing and interview backwards.  It's a long story, but the interview is of a myself as an author who's written a book about several characters, due to the Confines of media and time, I am writing the book backwards. Actually I haven't started the book yet, but I amWorking on the interview of the authorWhoIs being interviewed after the book was written.  Its super confusing, but It's one example of how I like to play with time.  Sometimes it's a full week between single words of the book.  Sometimes it's a whole week between single frames of my stop motion animation.  But at the end of the day, at the end of the project all of that time That the project took simply melts away into literal nothingness and isn't even visible to the future viewersViewing the book for the video

There's one more weird thing about life and times that I've noticed.  Have you ever read A biography of your most favorite famous person?  Even if they're pooping out albums or books every year, It still takes a year to do it.  They're just people whoHave their own life your own problemsIt's okay to give yourself sometime to do stuff.  Einstein did like one thing in his life.  And it took him fucking ages to figure it out.  Allow yourself the gift of time. Allow yourself some time toLet your unconscious mind do the work.  Let your unconscious mind make the connections between things.  Let your magical mind Drive things behind-the-scenes.  Allow it to tell you wind to turn left when usually turn right.  Our you going to hear the call unless you have a quietMindPractice being aware of yourself?  It all starts with being barefootOr being present in some other way.

One of the participants of my first high gazing workshop came out from it and said "now I know who I am."  If that's not an amazing result, I don't know what is.  The sign above the door at the Oracle's house and Matrix said know thyself.  Fuck the matrix. Know thyself has been around a lot longer than that.  When Jimi Hendrix played the Star-Spangled Banner he was lost in the moment he literally gave himself time playAnd play he did.  People go nuts when they see someone who's living in the moment in mealtime actually really truly being their present for Woman in that moment.  Being in the zone, being in the flow,Being able to lift a car off ofAccident victim because all of my power is here Center right in this exact moment right now.  That's the power of the human body that's the power that I'm talking about. That's the power that's ready for you to contact me if you can just get your fucking nose out of your book feel your breath for a moment.  

As I'm free styling these words, believing in the face of my editor toGood them and sort everything out. I hope he's in the flow in that moment just connecting with the words in connecting with  his inner guidance and being able to connect with the language.  It's chaos here. You should see it.

How allow your inner world to peak chaos.  Allow yourself time to sort yourself out.  Give yourself support to support yourself out. Let me be that person for you knows how to dive down into the chaos in finding gold that is down there been buried All of these years under the misunderstandings of the small child is trying to Figure out this place in a crazy world.  It's not his fault the world is crazy, but it is his problem, and  Please understand he has done the very best he can. Take a moment to look back on your inner child And bless yourself.  Give yourself the gift of digging down into the emotionsthat have Been there since they couldn't be processed at that time that they were laid down Due to a misunderstanding on the part of a small child or an adult who themselves didn't know any better.

* Don't put too much pressure on your future self cuz he's your best friend.  Don't micromanage his time.I am a boss to my future self and an employee of my former self.  don't micromanage or let yourself be micromanaged.
* Both the barefoot workshop and he high gazing workshop orWays to trigger an awareness of the inner self and inner world.  There are many ways to get there these are just two ways that I enjoy.

Take my next level workshops will begin to explore what blocks you from achieving what you were meant to bring to the world.

We will look at the trauma that were formed at early age and Work through the emotions and allow your inner guidance to shine through.  To allow your inner gold to shine through.

今回初めてeye gazing workshopに参加しました。わたしにとってそれは不思議な体験でした。まず二人ずつペアになって、数分間お互いの目を見つめ合いました。最初は恥ずかしく、照れ笑いがあったりしましたが、慣れてくるとメディテーションのような感覚で、何か集中した静かな時間が流れていました。

何度か回数を重ねると、徐々に相手の顔に動物のような模様が見えたり、顔が変形したり変化が見られました。また、相手の奥底にある精神的な面に触れることができた気がしました。不安があったり、軸のような強い意志があるように感じたり、目を見るだけでなにかを感じ取れているような感覚がありました。最近では人の目をずっと見ると違和感や、不快な思いをする方もいて、目を見ると行動は現代社会の中で欠如しているように思います。目を見るだけで少し不思議な体験ができたことがとても興味深く、より多くの人と意見をシェアして、eye gazing がどのような効果をもたらすのか知りたいと思いました。
