Today has seemed busy; my brain was spinning with what to do next for
a while this morning.  I ended up creating a new Part entry for Marble
Track 3 (tssfobls) before attending men's group meeting (Integration
Group Council).

Now I am on the way back from Tokyo station where I met Tariq and Jon
(for different reasons).  Tariq about ConSwi, and Jon to give him a
bag he left at our house.

I will hopefully be in time at home to attend Japanese lesson with
Mana at 3pm.  ギリギリかな。

Noborito station is next.  Looks like I will be home just in time.
