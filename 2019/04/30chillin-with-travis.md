Today Lin and I drove to Travis and Yumi's place to hang out with them
and Sakura.  Johan was already there and Deji came a bit later.  Nice
to see everyone again, though in some ways it's like the tribe is
getting smaller (and larger!)

No BBQ today due to rain, but we made 手巻き with chicken, eggs,
salad, and then ice cream at the end.

We laughed a lot, played with (funny) rubber balls, retrieved toys
from under the sofa set, and had a great time.

Peeps were ready to leave by the time I had to leave to get to men's
circle on time tonight, so Lin drove us to the station.  Driving a car
takes (unpredictably) longer than taking a train, so I took a train.

Deji and I sat on Yokohama line for a bit, talking about what racism
actually means.  He made a distinction between "pre judging" (making
predictions about someone) and "prejuduce" (assuming superiority over
someone).
