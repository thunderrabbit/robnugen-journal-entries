After Yomiuriland yesterday, the skin on the bottom of my left foot
split a bit.  This morning I superglued it shut and put some tape over
it.  Seems to be okay.

I put on socks and shoes to take off my shoes as I went into Lantz's
office.  I left my shoes on during my trip back home as the split is
painful.
