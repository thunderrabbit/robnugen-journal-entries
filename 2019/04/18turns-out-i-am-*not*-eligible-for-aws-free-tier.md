It turns out I am *not* eligible for AWS free tier..  Thank goodness
for their billing alarms.  It went off at $3 and I was like whhaaa??

It turns out free tier is only for new customers less than a year
old.  I have had my account for ages.. Why would their interface say
free tier next to anything while I am logged in?????
