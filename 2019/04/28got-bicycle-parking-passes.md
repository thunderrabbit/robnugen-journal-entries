Today we got our bicycle parking passes, which we applied for in
June 2016.  I bought a 3 month pass.  Lin got 1 month because she is
less certain she will like riding more than walking/bussing because of
the hills between our place and the station.

I figure 3 months will give me a pretty good sense of how much I like
biking to the station (bicycle parking area).
