Lin and I enjoyed a great productive day today, starting with a romp
after calling my mom on voip.

Main things for me: work on AB, fix bicycles.  Lin wanted to clean the
house a bit so she did that while I worked on AB.

We walked our decrepit bicycles to a local shop.  Mine had to get a
new chain; Lin's bicycle needed a new valve stem and new seat.

While the bicycles were being fixed, we walked to the station to get a
case for Lin's new work phone.

Upon riding back home I found one of my Japanese teachers had suggested
learning through songs, so I have decided to learn this song (found by
searching "Japanese songs learning" or something)
