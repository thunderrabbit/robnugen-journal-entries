Near the end of my [Marble Track 3 Construction Animation livestream
for today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tlb7LvQ71D0), I got a well meaning comment from the gloriously named **FE4R
Fart1oncheese**:

No doubt about that!  But I assured him the livestreams were not to be
viewed so much as to be a timer showing how long I have worked on
Marble Track 3.  Approximately 316 hours as of now.
