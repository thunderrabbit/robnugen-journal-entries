Back at SCC today with four student for 30 minutes each.  Hitomi came
in for Lily, who could not come.

I bought
[Cast Arrows](https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-arrows/), a new
Hanayama puzzle because I could not solve it in 20 minutes.  (not that
I can solve most of them in 20 minutes, but this one *looked* like I
could solve it and then I was like "woah that's not going to work???"
because one piece was jjuustt slightly too big to fit through a gap.
Dang, I thought they were all the same size.
