I am on the way back from Loreatec with another new battery in my
computer.  I replaced it back in December or so, but it never really
acted right.  Hopefully this one will do the right things.

Lantz offered this battery at no cost after I tried to pay him.  We
settled on half price.

Battery has gone from 36 to 31 percent in a few minutes.  I hope that
is reasonable.

I will leave my computer off now until I get home.
