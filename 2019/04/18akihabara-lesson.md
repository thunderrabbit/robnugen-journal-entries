I had some time before the lesson in Akihabara and ended up buying
some squishy toys that were even cooler than the one I bought late
last year.  These have balls inside them about the size of frog eggs,
and the outer balls stretch about as much as a frog's lower mouth.
The inner balls squirt out between fingers and make an awfully squirty
sound that is somewhat between stepping in mud and a cartoon splat.

Best lesson in a long time.

Atsuko read that the pandaball would expand if placed in water.  We
tried it, but it turned out that the balls *inside* the pandaball
would expand if placed in water.  We tried that instead, and they did
not grow as much as I hoped.

We then removed the rest of the balls so we could count them (Mayumi's
idea).  I guessed there would be 200.  Mayumi guessed 150.  Zumi
guessed 100.  Atsuko guessed 80.

It turned out there were 117 balls inside; Zumi won!  She also was
closest regarding the question "guess how big they will get?"

Mayumi brought chocorooms and chokoboos (I just made that name up) but
I chose not to eat the packs she gave me because I have been fasting
today since 2pm.  Yeah I know it is not long, but by tomorrow morning
it will be longer than I usually wait..
