Told RG my life story and he said he could hear my head, but not hear
my heart.  I said something something something and then he was like
"[that] will happen when you begin to love yourself"

And I just started to cry.  I do not love myself.  I love a lot of the
things I do, but apparently not the me who I *am*.

Shame at its finest and most subtle.  I did not even realize it until
he said it.
