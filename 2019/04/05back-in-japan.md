Back in Japan as of Wednesday and still a bit jet lagged.  Today I
plan to call AB and get back in the groove with them.

I have been reading [Urbit docs](https://urbit.org/docs/) and
considering starting one of my planets on my local machine here.
Gotta get that figured out before I try to start my star, ~wanbus.

Lesson in Akihabara was fine last night.  Mostly I told them about my
trip; only wrote two pages of notes.
