Though my phone conked out overnight without being charged, I was able
to get one picture with these guys

1. before I knew I would love them
2. before I knew I didn't have to wear shoes in the park

( image coming soon )

They came out to greet the incoming guests as the park opened, and I
got a picture with them because this guy was on a 2 meter tall
unicycle!

During the photo-op, I kinda ignored the juggler because I have seen
juggling before, but I have never been up close with a tall-ish
unicycle.

And to be honest, I didn't even really notice the woman behind me!

I noticed her during their 1pm show in which she and the unicyclist
did press up hand stands, a variety of balances on five different
semi-stackable chairs, and then demonstrated some amazing strength and
balance on a vertical spinning pole!

This culminated with him sitting in a chair on top of the pole (with
the chair leg inserted into the pole) during which I was like
*please-stay-strong please-stay-strong please-stay-strong* to the
chair leg as he spun around as she did skin-the-cats while hanging
from his arm and the pole.  (I think!)

Seems like half the time I could not tell *how* they were holding
themselves up on the pole; it seemed like magic!
