Well, I missed the first day of the month by 3 minutes.  I have been
zoned out in front of my computer longer than 3 minutes so oh well.

Logged 6 hours of work and noticed how much longer it will take.  At
10 minutes per line, and 400 more lines to change that's 4000 minutes
(hopefully max!), but that is just to get rid of a single singleton.

I am tired enough that I cannot do the math in my head.  4000 minutes
/ 60 = 65 hours..  dang that has got to be too much.  5 minutes per
line and we get 32 hours.

Anyway, the main point is that I feel shame for mis-guessing how long
it would take.  But I gotta let AB know the estimate.

I think I will start up their new DB server and use the existing web
server and new DB server for a bit, and then spin up new DB server
with Ubuntu 18.
