Today Naoko worked on introducing the history zone, including teacup
carrying dolls, perpetual clock, and the early days of electricity in
Japan.

What was it like back in the day when a simple thing like a few candle
power light bulb could be so impressive?

Yasu talked about the Meissner effect and flux pinning.  I would like
to do an experiment..  will the Meissner effect keep a thing suspended
above the magnetic table or is that only do to flux pinning?

Liliko confirmed some changes to some quiz questions for a new exhibit
that will be an audio recognition quiz.
