I'm on a local train in Shinjuku which will leave in less than a
minute from now.  I could have taken an express train which would get
to our station faster, but would not have afforded me a seat to write.

Just woke up in Kyodo.  Soshigaya-Okura now.  Super tired.  Too tired
to write kanji.

Express train.  I am changing.

Yay I got a seat on the express train in 向ヶ丘遊園 station.

Next stop is 新百合ヶ丘.
