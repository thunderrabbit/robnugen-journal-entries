Akiko and I went to her train line's side of Akihabara, and ate at the
Indian restaurant on the 9th floor of the BIC Camera building.
Bottomless cheese nan seems like a good deal until I eat the second
one!

We talked about her upcoming trip overseas and pets and other stuff I
am too tired to remember, much less write.  Oh, we also talked about
commas and when to use them.  Tough question!

Her Japanese teacher told her to add 、 when she wanted to say ね.
That's as good as most rules I've heard for commas in English.
