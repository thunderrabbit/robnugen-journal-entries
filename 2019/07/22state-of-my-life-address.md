When I was a child, my dad showed me how to use coat hangers as
divining sticks to find water.  At the time, I thought it was strange.
"Why should I have to use sticks if I can just ask and know the
answer?"

I did not apparently put this intuition to any practical purpose, but
I did do a few Tarot card readings based on this kind of channeled
information. I hadn't read about Tarot, But I would have people ask a
question and then choose cards at randomly and then I would just
freestyle information that came through.

I grew fascinated with the idea of "astral travel" and consciously, I
got as far as lucid dreaming, But not astral travel that I know of, or
at least not in the way that my imagination wanted it to happen.

If I practice recalling my dreams, while dreaming, I will often
recognize that "I am in that place where I can fly and control things"
But I usually don't recall that my physical body is somewhere.

One time while sleeping, I was doing gymnastics that I realized I
couldn't do my physical body.  I recognize I was in some sort ofState
of consciousness where myConsciousness was outside of my body.  And
the way that I naturally have proprioception, I realized my body was
folded over.  I tried to allow myself to float out of my body. I got
as far as my body being up in the air, but my head was stuck inside my
head.

I slowly came back into waking consciousness and felt my body floating
down into my physical body in a smooth transition, featuring lots of
vibrational tingling as the bodies merged.

I felt a lot of joy and excitement around this, and I began seeking
things to study.  I read one of Robert Monroe's books and soon went to
The Monroe Institute for their week long Gateway Voyage residential
training (in 1997 or so, a few years after his death).

At TMI's Gateway Voyage, I had a few interesting experiences regarding
states of consciousness, but did not "astral travel" the way I had
hoped.

We got to meet Joe McMoneagle and I became facinated with the how the
Life Review works upon death (or near death).

We watched the Powers of Ten video
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_Ten_(film)#1977_(%22Final%22)_version
and I cried for a grain of sand in the sidewalk after recognizing how
it had been ignored despite is crucial role in the world.

Around the same time, I began emotional catharsis work with Mankind
Project.  In my weekend training, I realized I was physically a man.
At age 27, I still felt like a boy.

I am going to make a jump here from biography to underlying patterns.

I often suffer from anger issues.  I once complained to my parents
that they were being too nice to each other.  I might describe their
behavior now as having been codependent.  They didn't take care of
their own needs first.

I have often given my power away to women, trying to make mommy happy
so that I can get her love.

I often fall into crushes with women, and I have learned to deal with
that I simply not acting on it...  Tt got to be too much trouble to
connect with a woman and then break up with her.  I recognize that the
work is to be done within myself, and the reality of the world around
me is a reflection of that.  These are words I can say theoretically,
but I don't really know what they mean for me nor how to apply them in
my life.

I get the very most easily angry when I judge people do not understand
me.  How very curious I find myself in a cross-cultural marriage where
not being understood is the norm.

Looking for the source of this anger regarding communication, The only
things that have kind of made sense our from past lives that I've
uncovered.  From small personal things where my army buddy was killed
after not listening to my guidance...  to larger scale massacres where
thousands of my men were ambushed and died due to a tactical mistake I
had made.  (where they DID listen to me and it got them killed)

In other past life news, I have a birthmark where apparently I was
stabbed, and I recall dying, feeling so sad that my wife would not get
the money that I had earned while being in war.  This lifetime, the
first time I washed my wife's back, I remembered that it was not the
first time I had washed her back, and in fact my present-lifetime wife
may have played the role of the woman who I left with kids while I
died in battle.

In a different path life, I remember being a big simple man, who was
taking care of by a witch who lived up the hill because she was
ostracized by the community.  She would send me into town with simple
shopping tasks.

At age 8 or so this lifetime,mMy dad told me how incredibly smart and
talented I was.  In some ways, this information has been a curse on
me, as I have assumed I should be able to figure things out.  I often
shame myself for not having figured things out the first time through.

In a different anecdote from this lifetime, My dad and I were paddling
in a canoe on the lake somewhere.  It was a beautiful father-son
experience. His friend came by with the small motorboat, and offered to
tow us ashore.  The experience of the raw speed in a canoe was
thrilling.  I absolutely loved it and would love to do it again
sometime.  Afterward, my dad said his friend said I was "grinning from
ear to ear."  I hated to know that I had been seen and that I had
been somehow caught in this moment of joy.

And yet another anecdote from this lifetime, my dad knocked down a
wasps nest from under the eave of our house.  The wasps were all dead,
but I was still scared of the nest.  I gathered up all of my courage
and threw the nest into the street, then suddenly heard cheers from my
parents.  I was shocked and angry that they had been watching me the
whole time.  Somehow my test of courage had not been such a test after
all.  I should've known it wasn't dangerous because they (apparently)
knew it.

At this point I am taking a break in writing.
