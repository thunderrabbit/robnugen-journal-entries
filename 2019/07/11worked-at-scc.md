Interesting to talk about the Meisner effect and flux pinning at SCC
today.  I have always assumed I understand the meaning based on the
English presentation, but I felt a bit unsure when I was breaking it
down in detail for Yasu as he was practicing his explanation of the
same.

My understanding: when a superconductor is below its critical
temperature it pushes (almost) all magnetic flux out of itself.  This
is the Meisner effect, apparently named after a scientist named
Meisner.

Impurities in the superconductor mean some lines of magnetic flux
pierce the superconductor and the superconductor "remembers" the
strength and direction of those lines and pins itself to them.  This
is called flux pinning, apparently not named after a scientist.

What is this "memory"?  I guess while the material is not a
superconductor, magnetic flux pierces it like any other non-ferrous
material.  As it becomes superconducting as it passes below its
critical temperature the flux already passing through it are... what
exactly?

(( I wonder if electrical resistance in normal conductors is what
causes the magnetic fields???  hmmm ))
