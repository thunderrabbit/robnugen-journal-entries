One camping spot remained when we arrived yesterday.  It's the high
season and reservations are recommended.  We set up the tent which
thankfully came with ropes to keep it from rotate-collapsing.

This tent is "easy" to set up because it has a "one touch" function
that kinda springs the four foldable(!) legs into a spidery stance.
Without its rain tarp tied to the legs and the rain tarp tied to the
environment, it's flimsy af, but with the 6 provided ropes in place,
it's reasonably fine.

I am a bit envious of Taro's larger tent next door, with its three
arcing support tubes, but our setup is pretty sweet, too.

After setting up the tent, we had an lovely dinner including easy-cook
rice in bags that kinda cooks itself in 15 minutes after we pour water
into the rice in the bag.

I had a seated shower at the communal bath house with four shower
seats and one bath.  I apparently arrived at rush hour; there were no
fewer than 4 adults and an average of two boys each in the room.

I read Bedtime for Bear to Lin and Mikarin and then lights out at
10pm, just before a young girl started wailing crying.  She eventually
cried herself out, but apparently started again at midnight, according
to Lin.  This bear was sleeping by then and did not notice.
