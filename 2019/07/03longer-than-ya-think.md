Today I wanted to write an email to AB as a status update on the
upgrade I am doing for them.  The update has been taking longer than
expected, both in terms of the amount of work required and the amount
of time I have not been able to spend on it.

To write the email, I wanted to make sure my plan will work.  I wanna
get their system upgraded to latest LTS version of Ubuntu, 18, Bionic
Beaver.  I have written a lot of tests while upgrading their old PHP
system, but I could not get the test framework to work on Ubuntu 18.
Sigh.

So the email that I hoped I could write in an hour has taken 4 hours
and still ain't finished.
