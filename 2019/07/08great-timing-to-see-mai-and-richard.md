On the way home from Akabanebashi today, I happened to cross paths
with Mai, who saw me as she was walking perpendicular to my path of
travel, focused on a youtube video about teleportation paradox in
Portal.

Wow!  Hi!  Headed over to the cafe to chat with Richard and trade
travel stories.  Great and grateful to see them!
