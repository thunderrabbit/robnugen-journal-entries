Today there were only 1.5 students in my Akihabara class.  This number
is down from our high of like 8 last year when I had to stop checking
homework during the lesson because there ended up being no time for
class.  I guess there would be time with just 2 students' worth of
homework.

Anyway, the lesson kinda devolved into a China vs Japan debate.  I
should have nipped it, but I was too tired and I kinda thought the
students would sort it out.
