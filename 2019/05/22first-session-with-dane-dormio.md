I just finished a two hour session with Dane Dormio, during which we
got a high level look at how I am doing in different areas of my life
versus how I want to be doing in those areas.  Then identified some
action and habit I can implement in the next week.

Action: clear space for new printer

Habit: continue exercises from A Course in Miracles

<!-- State of my Life from that perspective (unfinished):

ENERGY

FOCUS

-->
