Until now, we have always had inkjet printers.  Our inkjet printer
ran out of ink *again*, and I was like ef this.  We are buying a
laser printer.

It arrived today.

It is thrice as heavy as the inkjet and ten times as fast, a lot more
crisp, and omg super great.

It scans like a champ (with its autofeeder that even worked with
somewhat not-flat pages).  This laser printer is lovely.
