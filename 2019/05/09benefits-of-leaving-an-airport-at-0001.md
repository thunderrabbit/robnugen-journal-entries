My friend wanted to buy a ticket to leave on Saturday and accidentally
bought a ticket that leaves at 00:01am (one minute after midnight)
Saturday morning. (26 hours from now as I write this)

I challenged him to write 25 benefits of such a situation.  Here are
mine:

1. have a funny story
2. be awake with nothing to do but watch digital clock turn from 23:59:59 to 00:00:00
3. arrive at airport when it's relatively quiet
4. get a chance to see behind-the-scenes stuff they only do at night at airports
5. not have to wake up early for a flight
6. have already halfway solved the jetlag issue
7. get to really ponder the human construct of tracking time
8. have a chance to put a smile on face of staff working late
9. save time shopping for souvenirs
10. save money on buying souvenirs
11. have moving walkway all to yourself
12. get to wonder if other passengers made the same mistake
13. get to joke about how early the flight is
14. easy chance to sleep late on Saturday
15. no worries about a large choice of food vendors in airport
16. immediate night mode on plane so can sleep quickly
17. "I leave tonight" and "I leave tomorrow" are both true
18. passport stamps says you left the day before you actually leave
19. opportunity for taking nighttime photos at airport
20. can play in kids zone because no kids will be there
21. can say "good evening" to one seatmate immediately before "good morning" to next seatmate.
22. easily compare flight duration with length of day
23. get to board a plane wearing pajamas
24. get wonder when and wear the pilots slept
25. can say "I remember getting on the plane like it was yesterday"
