Now that I will not likely add any more shortlinks to
[Marble Track 3 website](https://www.marbletrack3.com), I have been
[expanding them in the markdown](https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/commit/861074a388dff52bb655b378e45656f88e9ca400), which will save a redirect each time
people click on the links.
