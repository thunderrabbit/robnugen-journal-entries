Today I showed students in Akihabara the website and snippets for
[Marble Track 3](https://www.marbletrack3.com/).  They were like
"waow" etc.  I love the project and felt a bit guilty for taking up
a significant amount of class time with it.  We have had lessons for
years though, so I don't think they will mind.
