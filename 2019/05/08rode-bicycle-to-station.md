I rode TJ Bike to the bicycle parking lot today.  This is the first
time I have done so for work, given that we got our bicycle parking
passes during Golden Week, and this is the first day that I have to
work outside the house.

I usually allow 24 minutes to walk leisurely to the station.  Riding
TJ Bike "leisurely" down a big hill, I arrived at the bicycle parking
area in 8 minutes.  Leisurely locking TJ Bike and walking to the train
took 6 minutes.  So it took 14 minutes from house door to train door.
