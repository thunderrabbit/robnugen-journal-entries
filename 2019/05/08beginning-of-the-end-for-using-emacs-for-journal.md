Emacs is great in many ways.  I mostly use dired (Directory Edit)
mode, including (bulk) moving and (bulk) renaming files.

I no longer use it for mail, since mail does not live on my
server. Hmm I wonder if ...  hmmmm I will ask Fred since I think he
still uses Emacs for mail.

Emacs is great for *creating* these journal entry templates, and
Marble Track 3 episodes and parts..  BUT, I do not yet know how to
make Emacs do autocompletion which Atom does so easily.  In the
previous entry I referenced TJ Bike, and it would be cool to have that
actually linked to a post or wiki entry on TJ Bike.
