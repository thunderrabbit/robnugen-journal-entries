Robert Golden and I enjoyed chatting at the onsen near Minami-tama
station on JR Nambu line.  Great to get to know each other better.  I
told him about how I ended up in Japan, including Tammy, Bonnie,
Wende, janette, Lin.  We talked about MKP Japan and the work we are
doing here.  I learned how he ended up in Hawaii.

I wished we could hang out longer at the onsen; I did not finish all
my lunch and did not finish sitting in all the pools + both saunas.
But chronos time calls and I am now headed to work at SCC.

Smartly, I brought dress clothes for work and am now clothed, dressed
smartly for work.

Hugged Robert bye on Nambu line in Noborito; he is headed to Hiroo,
and then leaving Japan tomorrow or Saturday.
