It turns out I like the bag Lin bought online better than the bag I
bought in a shop last year.  The wheels on her bag are larger and
quieter.  That was something I could not test on the linoleum tile
floors in the shop.  That sounded perfectly smooth there, but out on
the street they are raucous.

And this bag has more pockets.  I thought I could survive with the
number of pockets on the other bag, but this one is way more pockety
