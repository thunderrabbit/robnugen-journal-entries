Lots of changes since just three weeks ago.

1. I created a Gofundme with a target of $46,000 to [kick off Mankind
Project Japan](https://www.gofundme.com/launching-mankind-project-operations-in-japan).  $525 so far!
2. I created a 2.5 minute demo as a TEDx audition vid.
[Safely expressing emotions makes life better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4el81YK3s3Q).
3. Pinky has placed most of the decorative blocks along the
   [Decorative Walls after the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/decorative_walls_after_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/),
   although I have not taken a new picture that shows all of them so
   far.
4. I have been checking in with Dora each week recently after signing
   up for her [Thrive in Japan](https://www.thriveinjapan.com/)
   course.  She brought the big shifts to my attention so I am writing
   about them now!
5. Shirley has offered 50,000 air miles toward my trip to the US.
   Trying to go to Vancouver (and hopefully see Colleenie Beanie Dog!)
   then Houston/Austin, then Hawaiiiiii
6. Delta-Mom has offered a buddy pass ticket price, so that should
help as well!  Gifts from the heavens!
7. I will be taking a five week course starting this week which should
give me some insights on making Tokyo Men's Circle even better.
8. I have been trying to clean up my new.robnugen.com deploy process
so it can run on Netlify.com
9. Kevin's website was down after a wordpress automatic upgrade failed
   to copy over the themes and plugins from the old installation.  I
   guess they were in a non-standard location.  I got it fixed though,
   and it was nice to talk to him.
10. I hired a designer to make a nicer version of
    [Marble Track 3 website](https://www.marbletrack3.com/).  As of
    this writing, the live site looks like
    this
    https://5c42ec0d7c4b6f0008a1f95c--wonderful-bhabha-dfd1ef.netlify.com/,
    and the new site looks something like this
    https://vigilant-mayer-608cf8.netlify.com/
