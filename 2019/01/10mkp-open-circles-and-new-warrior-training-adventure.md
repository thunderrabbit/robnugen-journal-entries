Men,

Back when I joined Mankind Project in 1997, the New Warrior Training
Adventure was the only way to get started in Mankind Project.

Attending the weekend was a life changing experience for me.  It was
on that weekend that I realized I was a man.  It was during that
weekend that I began to get over my fear of men.

Over the years, as an organization, Mankind Project has begun
encouraging new men to sit in Open Circles (like the one we have in
Tokyo) before attending the New Warrior Training Adventure (NWTA).

I believe the NWTA is still a life changing experience, even after you
have been sitting in an open circle.  Over the course of the weekend,
there is more time to really get into the work than we can in 2 hours.

Anyway, I very rarely do anything like sales pitches in the meetings.
I assume you cannot go.  I assume you are not interested.  I assume
all sorts of things that stop me from inviting you.

I hereby invite you to challenge me on Tuesday if I do not bring up
the NWTA coming up in Hawaii, March 29th - 31st.

I also hereby invite you to join me in Hawaii for the NWTA, March
29th - 31st.  I will be on staff, and look forward to seeing you there.

Is this the time for you? I don't know.  But if you are interested,
start here: https://nwta.mkp.org/
