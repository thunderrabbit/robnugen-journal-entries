Just a couple days ago I got my tickets all sorted to staff two
different NWTA weekends and also attend the MKP USA Face to Face
weekend in Texas.

After pretty much settling on the plans, it was pointed out that
attending an IGFT might give me more of the training I am looking for,
but I trust this is the training / trip I need.

The goal of all this is to deepen the (emotional) work we can do in
Tokyo Men's Circle, by improving my facilitation skills.  That will
thereby hopefully inspire more men to take facilitation roles in the
group.

In addition, we are beginning to translate one of the workshops into
Japanese so we can invite Japanese men into the work as well.  For
that part, I am asking Takeshi to lead and facilitate; maybe we should
do a trial run and then a small version, then a real version.
