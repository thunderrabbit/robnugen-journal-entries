It has taken me a long time to reach this point, but from
[being afraid of men](/journal/1997/11/15/new-warrior-training) in
1997, I am now facilitating deep emotional work in men's circles every
week, both online and face to face in Tokyo.

I want to deepen my skills as a facilitator and have decided to step
more fully into this emotional awareness work.  To improve my facilitation
skills, I plan to staff two (2)
[New Warrior Training Adventure](https://nwta.mkp.org) weekends, back
to back in March and April.  (full disclosure, I will also attend the
MKP Face to Face Gathering in March, but I do not completely know what
that will include.)

To this end, Jeremy was like, "why don't you put together a Gofundme
page to help raise money for the trip?"  Wow great idea!  Then Michael
was like, "the trip is just the starting point; let's start Mankind
Project Japan."

He worked out a bare bones budget for 2019, but it is still beyond
what I have ever thought about.  Life changing work.
