The GoFundme text is not finished yet, but I plan to finish it up
tonight or tomorrow.

It took a while to get this version complete, including breaking a pen
and crying my eyes out with Mark at the Jonathan's near <ruby><rb>向ヶ
丘遊園駅</rb><rt><ruby><rb>むこうがおかゆうえんえき
</rb><rt>mukogaokayuen station</rt></ruby></rt></ruby>.

Between working for TY and AB, I got this version complete in one
take, after about 30 takes over a period of a week or so.
