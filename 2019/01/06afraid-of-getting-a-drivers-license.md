    Write a few sentences about something you did during your ordinary day.

Realized I can get a drivers license

    Which one of these simple event of the day had an odd moment? Or
    evoked an emotion such as aggravation, frustration, surprise,
    miscommunication.  **Name the emotion.**

I realized there was no reason to be a afraid.  I wasn't afraid of
riding roller coasters (but some people were).  Why should I be afraid
of getting a drivers license (as most people are not)?

    What were you trying to achieve?  What did you want?

Wanted to get a driver's license.

    What was stopping you from getting what you wanted?  Was the block
    internal or external?

Block was internal.  People might notice me, or judge me

    Why was this important to you?  **Was there a backstory** that would
    help us understand why this is so important?

Freedom

    What **lesson** did you learn from all of this?

Shut up and drive

    What **change** can we make in our lives from here on?

Stop letting fear drive the proverbial car in life
