2019 is pretty easy to type because the numbers are right next to each
other on both sides of the keyboard.

Lin and I went to her sister's house for new years celebrations.  Went
to karaoke and then a Chinese izakaya (fusion?) before going to the
local shrine where some guys were burning bamboo in metal drums.

We arrived home about an hour before 2019 and took turns taking
showers.  (I got to wear Toru's clean underwear, t-shirt, and dress
shirt.  Thank goodness because mine smelled like smoke after the
restaurant.)  All clean, Charu arrived back in the living room at
23:59:48.

Happy New Year!  Hugs all around and a kiss for Lin then headed home
soon thereafter.
