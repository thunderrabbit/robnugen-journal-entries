Well, she did the impossible.  Se-chan convinced me that I should sign
up for her MLM selling tea because she had found a superwoman with a
huge network and she would put her into my downline if I sign up
today.

Going over the numbers, I will be paying 9500 yen per month for
basically bottomless tea, and a likely a bunch of chances to practice
Japanese.  Hmm.  Okay I'll do it.

Went to 平塚 station, just one station past 茅ヶ崎 (where I used to
live with Soness) and signed the dotted line with the help of
Se-chan's mom, Tae, who got me sorted out in about 30 minutes.

I have a *sense* of how this stuff works; I spent a couple years in
Amway before I was like "eff this; I ain't doing all the stuff they
do," referring to the rallies and stuff to amp people up to think they
can jet around on jets and jet skis if they sell enough merch.  I mean
it's possible, but it's a hella lot of work.

My ruff plan is to focus on depth, not width.  Talk to people *slowly*
and *honestly* and *casually* about it until I find someone who is
willing to sign up.  Then get their names list and contact alllll of
them.

This is the method I heard went well for whathisname, my upline
Diamond...  maybe their names were Don and Nancy?

Anyway, one more thing to add to the list of potential income streams.
