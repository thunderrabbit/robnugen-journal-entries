I am excited about Remembering Past Lives workshop today

(written 17:13 Thursday 12 September 2019 JST:)

Two people in attendance and had a good time!  Great to hear their
questions at the beginning.  One was "What's the process?"

    Each participant gets into a relaxed position, usually either sitting
    in a chair, or laying down, or otherwise sitting against something
    comfortable.
    
    I will spend a few minutes leading you through a relaxation process,
    whereby you let your body relax and keep your mind awake.  Once you
    are in this mind awake / body asleep mode, I'll invite you to imagine
    getting up and leaving the room.  In your mind I will guide you to
    travel far away, whether by vehicle, or through a cave, or through a
    forest and arrive somewhere familiar.
    
    I will give you a chance to explore the familiar area, including
    seeing other inhabitants of the area and moving around and
    communicating with them.
    
    I will lead you gently back the way you came, allowing you to have
    clear memory of what happened and what you heard and saw.  Once your
    awareness focuses back on your physical body, you will have a chance
    to write down what you heard and saw.  We will not speak until
    everyone is pretty much done writing.
    
    The whole process is a state of light hypnosis, and you will still
    have full control and awareness of where your physical body is.  You
    will be able to come back in a moment's notice if you choose.

    Each process will take about 20 or 30 minutes.

One participant saw the same place in two of the three excursions we
did.  The other saw some of the same imagery twice, but did not report
as clear of a vision of the place itself.

All in all, a great time!
