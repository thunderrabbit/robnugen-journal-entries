We had a typhoon Sunday night / Monday morning.  It was fine for us,
but a doozy in some parts of our area.  People died.

Leaves blown everywhere.

Two high tenstion power towers collapsed.

And the one that amazes me most for its precision destruction, a net
blew down from a golf driving range and sliced roofs of houses.

For me, it was pretty chill.  I did not have to go out, so I walked
with Lin to the station and had a drink with her while waiting for the
train.  Everything calmed down in our station and she got on the train
no problem... but then in Shinjuku, it took ONE HOUR to change lines
from Odakyu Line to Yamanote Line.
