##### 11:11 Wednesday 04 September 2019 JST

1. Yesterday I walked from Shinjuku to Hiroo, from the men's group new
   meeting location to our old one.  Last night we met for the last
   time at Takeshi's office, and next week we will be in Shinjuku, at
   a place I have not yet seen.  I have booked it for all of September
   and October, and trust we can get it for longer if we like it.
2. I did my first workshop last month (Eye Gazing, on August 17th).
   We had a great turnout so I am planning to do it again on September
   28th.  Yay!
3. Last night Mark gave me the idea of doing workshops for a living.
   It certainly fits my skillset [moreso than programming](/journal/2019/09/03/brain-pounding-eyes-vibrating-too-much-computer/)!
4. Marble Track 3 now features CSFERP (Caret Splitter Feeder
   Extenstion Reflection Protection), put in place yesterday by
   Reversible Guy.
5. I have not yet gotten into the groove of writing blog entries, but
   recently I have put that on my daily ROBOT pages as a 10 point todo
   item.
6. I have been keeping daily ROBOT pages since May, thanks to Hiro for
   the idea.
7. I had my first session with Dean Ramsden.  It was less illuminating
   than	I guessed/hoped it might be, but I have different sets of
   questions for next time.
8. Lin and I have been doing better over the past month or more,
   mostly because I have been chilling tf out and being more
   accomodating for communication styles and grammars.
9. I got AB's DB moved to AWS RDS.  Yay!  Thanks to Travis for
   introducing me to Ansible.  Thanks to Ansible for making things
   replicable.
10. I created a Page on FB.
    [Barefoot Rob](https://www.facebook.com/pg/barefootrob/).  I
    resisted giving in to the borg for a long time, and still want to
    keep my content on my server, but they make it so dang easy!
11. I am ecstatic with the turnout from
    [my first Eye Gazing workshop](https://www.facebook.com/events/2465227863708851/);
    14 people attended, incluing myself.  I have scheduled a second
    [Eye Gazing workshop](https://www.facebook.com/events/493730671447073/)
    for Sep 28th, and a
    [Remembering Past Lives](https://www.facebook.com/events/2054284838201319/)
    workshop for September 7th.  Looking forward to both!
12. I have been fascinated with the idea of channeling information
    from non-local sources.
    [Bashar via Darryl Anka](https://www.bashar.org/) is the first
    that I paid attention to, and now Abraham via
    [Esther Hicks](https://www.abraham-hicks.com).  I wonder about
    developing my own channeling skills.
13. Jennie is still our cat. Lin recently said Jennie is 7 years old.
14. I still do not have a driver's license in Japan (nor the US, since
    my old license expired).  Lin wants me to get one, but I do not
    really want to drive in Tokyo.  Especially not have to drive her
    "big" minivan.
15. I showed up 25 minutes late to my online group today and no one
    was there.  It's like my worst dream come true, after I had just
    written a page of gratitude to the men of the group for keeping it
    going while I am not in attendance.
