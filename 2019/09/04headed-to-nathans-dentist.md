I'm headed to Nathan's dentist which is now my dentist.

I like this dentist because he didn't waste time checking my teeth
three (3) appointments in a row without doing anything.

First appointment: "I recommend you fix this; wanna do it now?"

Yes!

##### 16:49

He worked on two teeth, and best I can understand, he filled a filling
on the left lower third from back tooth, which also suffers from gum
disease (receding gum).  He also smoothed down a filling on the right,
saying it had been placed too thick on the tooth and kind of covered
the gum (like a roof, not a wall)
