No students in my 6pm class here.  And my most-common student in next
lesson has called in that he will not attend.  I'm gonna use this time
to write a bit.

I had been planning to talk to them about
[WTC 7](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=wtc+7) and stuff on the anniversary
of Airplane Day.

##### 19:39

No students in my 7pm class...

##### 20:00

One student in 8pm class.

We started the lesson talking about the typhoon and her plans to
practice piano next Sunday for a rehearsal on September 22nd.

Ended up talking about my websites, and I realize why I am so
distracted!
