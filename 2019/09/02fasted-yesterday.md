After having eaten extra ice cream and stuff late at night on the
31st, I fasted yesterday.  Pretty easy, though I worked out at SOGO.
Usually that would make me woozy if I hadn't eaten, but yesterday
seemed fine.

I have a bit of a headache now, which may be related to fast, or eat,
or not enough water, or upcoming (first) session with Dean
