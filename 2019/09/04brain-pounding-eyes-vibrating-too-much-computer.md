Last night when I finally went to sleep around 11 pm my brain was
pounding headachey and my eyes were vibrating in a strange way like,
not in a good way.

I chalk it up to too much time spent on my computer.

it kept me awake for a while, but I was finally able to calm myself
down into sleep.

I'm on my way to the dentist now, recording this with voice
transcription.  But I just wanted to add it as a point of reference in
my eyeball medical history.
