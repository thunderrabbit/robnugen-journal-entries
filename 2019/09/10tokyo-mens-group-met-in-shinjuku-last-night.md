Tuesday night [Tokyo Mankind Project](https://www.mkpjapan.org) men's
circle met in Shinjuku for the first time in our hourly-rented space.

The space worked well, so I have booked it for the next three months'
worth of Tuesdays.  It's clean, quiet, has cool chairs and beautiful
hardwood floor.  Plus it's only about 2 minutes from Shinjuku station,
so come on out!

We have not sorted out how the group will pay for it exactly.  We had
donations of 5500 yen last night, though the room cost around 7000
yen.  We are having discussions on LINE about each man donating 500
yen per week regardless of attendance.  That will hopefully encourage
men to attend.
