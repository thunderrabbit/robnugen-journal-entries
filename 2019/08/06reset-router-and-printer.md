Our old router suddenly stopped routing, but fortunately I had not
given away the new router that was left when people moved out from an
apartment Lin was asked to clean out.

The new router worked, but after getting it going, the printer
password would not work and I ended up having to reset the printer
network which lost the ssh settings for scanning to b.robnugen.com and
now I cannot get them set up again for lack of the server key which I
think I remember where I got it from before but it ain't working now.
