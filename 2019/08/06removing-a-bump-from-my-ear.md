Soon I will go to the old man skin doctor who identifies skin
conditions in about 5 seconds.  Never have to wait in line.  Always
got things right so far.

I got a swollen bit in my ear lobe and he's gonna cut it out today.
Hopefully I can get pictures.

No pictures.  And quite a shock, which [I posted on FB](https://www.facebook.com/thunderrabbit/posts/10162144887075716).

    Shocked, I am!
    
    I had a sebaceous cyst behind my ear lobe (like against the skull,
    not ear lobe itself) and I asked the doctor if he could take it
    out.
    
    He said yes, and did it today.
    
    I didn't know he would take the skin too!!!
    
    I asked to see the cyst and they were like "that's the cyst and
    this side is skin."
    
    That was my favorite behind-my-left-earlobe skin!!!
    
    Is that normal to remove a square cm of skin? Like a cubic cm
    altogether.

I am most relieved with [Jaime's reply](https://www.facebook.com/thunderrabbit/posts/10162144887075716?comment_id=10162144896065716&reply_comment_id=10162144906185716)

    That’s crazy man! It’s your flesh! But we do replenish skin cells
    totally every 5 months so you need not be attached to something
    you can grow back in less than a year! I know you know that though
    just stating the obvious to cheer you up about losing your
    favourite behind-your-left-earlobe skin!
