Just this morning I realized I have at least two different types of
dreams.  One type seems to just be my brain sorting stuff out.  I
dream about work or mundane things like that.

Another type seems to be a place that I go.  The scenes are always
filled with friends living together in a building with multiple rooms,
a campground with multiple cabins, multiple levels with stairs and
stuff, and a lot of different activity happening.

I have come to believe this is an actual place in a beyond-3D meaning
of both words.
