Lily had not seen the
[(silent) video snippets for Marble Track 3](http://mt3s.robnugen.com/),
so I sent her a link on LINE after we finished looking at her study
material.  I told her about cases of normally countable words used as
adjectives, (e.g. "He has a 3 year old." vs "His kid is 3 years old.")
