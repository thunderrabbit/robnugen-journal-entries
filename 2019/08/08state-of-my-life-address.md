1. My old thunderrabbit router conked out so now we are using a new one
   with three antennas and mutiple channels and all that good stuff.
2. The conking coincided with new printer disallowing login so I reset
   the networking and therefore lost the few scan-to-ssh profiles I
   had set up.  I have half of them restored and a few new ones
   planned.
3. This allows me to scan A4 pages and upload to my b.robnugen.com
   server (b stands for binary).  Most of them are going to be in
   https://b.robnugen.com/robot/ (where robot represents for R.O.B.O.T., which
   stands for my personal [religion I made](https://wiki.robnugen.com/wiki/Category:R.O.B.O.T.) after reading
   [Shaving the Inside of your Skull](https://archive.org/details/shavinginsideofy00ashm)
   by Mel Ash) whereas others will be in other directories
4. I have started writing my dreams and scanning them to
   https://b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/ In the future I hope to
   have an automagic way to display thumbnails, allow paging through
   the images, transcribing them, and naming the files nicely.
5. For now, the filenames created by the scanner include date, name,
   topic, and a counter which shows the order in which they were
   scanned.
6. I recently discovered I apparently applied to JB in October 2014 (I
   think)
7. I have recently scheduled two (2) workshops. Oh snap I should
invite people to them.
8. August 17th [https://www.facebook.com/events/2465227863708851/](Eye
   Gazing Workshop), which will allow people to really connect deeply
   to themselves and others in a safe heart-filled space
9.
