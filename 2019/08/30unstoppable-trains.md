<p class="dream">
One train came and slammed through the car on the tracks.  Another
train came on the adjacent tracks and slammed through the car on
those tracks.  A third train came through and I knew it must be a
dream so I threw the garbage of the KKK uniforms under the train and
watched it be carried away relentlessly by the wheels unstopping and
then noticed the train was not that long so they could see it was me
and I thought good thing it's a dream and then an old black man came
by laughing and we laughed our asses off as they train curved its way
slowly around the whole valley as I started to make up straight lies
"it took them then years to finish those tracks god bless the lives
that were lost falling down the valley" and visualized under water the
skeleton not there as the lie had been told and just fish who didn't
even know what a lie *was* much less that it had been told and didn't
affect their lives in any way.
