Liliko and I talked about the best way to support one of her staff who
wants to guide tours in English, but does not yet have the basics of
English conversation down.  In the past some guides just straight
memorize the scripts but do not fully understand what they are
saying.  We are trying to avoid that if possible.  I suggested
er-central.com and mylanguageexchange.com

I also told her about Dean Ramsden; I am looking forward to working
with him.
