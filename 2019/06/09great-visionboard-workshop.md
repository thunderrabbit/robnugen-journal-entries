Six people in the visionboard workshop tonight.  Great teaching points
for me because Rin said the day before that I was the only one who
expressed interest in attending.  The next day three more chose to
come, so it was Hiro, Rin, me, then three others, who were perfectly
balanced for each other and us.  Similar backstories, blessings for me
to learn, etc.

I thought I would leave with a fancy visionboard, but I left with so
much more understanding as to how I keep my vision from happening, and
how I can allow it to happen by doing the work(shops) and the invitations.
