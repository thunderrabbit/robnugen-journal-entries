Today I spun up three (3) different instances on
[Vultr.com](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8151506)

I spun up 1GB, 2GB, and 4GB RAM instances, with 25GB, 55GB, and 80GB
SSD storage,
respectively.

I am trying them all out with
[$50 credit good for 30 days](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8152715-4F),
so I am doing the testing in parallel during this $50 credit window.
