I think I am on day 27 in A Course in Miracles.

    My attack thoughts attack my invulnerability

1. I am concerned about missing the train

* I am afraid I might not get a seat
* I am afraid I might have to stand
* I am afraid I might be late for work
* I am afraid I might lose my job
* I am afraid I might get yelled at
* I am afraid I might feel shame
* I am afraid I might feel sad
* I am afraid I might feel moe joe
* I am afraid I might get into an accident

These thoughts attack my invulnerability.
