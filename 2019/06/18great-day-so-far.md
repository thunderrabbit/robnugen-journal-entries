I got 1.5 hours of livestream done on MT3 and about an equal amount of
work done on AB.  Plus spent time ostensibly studying Japanese by
watching Kakegurui in Japanese.  (Season 2 now has subtitles in English.)

Anndd had a nice nap.

Rode TJ Bike to the station and am now on my way to 麻布十番 for my
third session with Rin.

We are going to work on my first workshop together as well.

Then men's circle tonight.
