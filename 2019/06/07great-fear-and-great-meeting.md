Had a great meeting this morning where I was able to express my fear
and feelings of inadequacy about being a leader.

Next steps, I will:

* Ask men "who do you want to sit in circle with you?"
* send English version to Zumi
* write my experience online
* send Doodle regarding next meeting time
* contact 3 men to invite
