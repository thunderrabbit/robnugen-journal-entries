Fun in the sun today at SOGO Bootcamp.  We had to adjust our normal
workout area due to puddles, but all good and lots of fun.  I remet
Anuj, Valeria, Lisa, Alex, Ben.  Got to see Haruo and Jim again as
they led ultimate frisbee after bootcamp.

We played until about 1:18pm with about 6 on 6 down to 4 on 4 as
people had to go.
