I walked gently toward our station while repeating the lesson for
today.  I included "I am determined to see time differently" an was
intrigued as I walked past a man who was walking slowly; it felt right
/ fine to do so.

Arrived at the train station and just missed the local train, but
whatdya know the next train was a Hakone Limited Express (or
something) and the next stop is Shinjuku, and I got a seat (for 410 yen).
