Tonight in Azabu Juban I attended Tokyo Tribe's workshop number 8, a
look back at the first half of 2019, and a look forward at the second
half.

Here is what I wrote as testimonial:


    I learned I did a great deal in 2019 already and got good insights
    on what types of behaviors support my continued growth.
    
    Therefore, I can focus on the helpful behaviors and achieve even
    more in the second half of 2019.
    
    I discovered fears from my childhood have kept me from acting in
    my highest joy and inner growth
