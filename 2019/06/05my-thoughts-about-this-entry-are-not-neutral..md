In Portland, I noticed how dramatically my experience was affected
just by the focus of my emotions.  If I focused on love the experience
was wonderfully positive.  If I focused on fear, the experience was
horrifically negative.  It was like an exponential amplifier that
responded profoundly to the slightest deviation from neutral.

Today is Day 16 for me in [A Course in Miracles](https://acim.org/)

    I have no neutral thoughts

This idea makes sense to me in light of my experience from before.
