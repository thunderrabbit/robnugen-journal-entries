1. I met Yuri Logo today to talk about making a logo for my brand.
   She was recommended by Rin so I was like yay!  She asked lots of
   questions and said she had good ideas for it.  I could see in her
   smile the excitement and I felt good about that.
2. I will be working with Rin in a life coaching capacity.  I look
   forward to an accountability partner and learning some new
   facilitation techniques.
3. [Marble Track 3 website](https://www.marbletrack3.com) now has a
   Construction section, which shows some of the snippets.  Not all
   the snippets are there, and they are not all fully fleshed out yet,
   but I look forward to finishing that section, especially if I can
   do it via a data file which can be parsed in differen ways.
4. Lin has been enjoying her new job and will soon get to have flex
   time hours, going from 10am to 6pm.  Hopefully the trains will be a
   bit less packed in the mornings.
5. We bought a laser printer recently.  I did it out of frustration of
   buying tons of ink for the inkjet printer, and now I realize what a
   great investment it is.  Now I can print pages like wheeee instead
   of having a gut wrenching wonder if I would get streaks in the
   pages.
6. I used the printer to print a flyer for our Japanese workshop
coming up in July.

Some people could not scan the QR code, so I made one with a normal
square QR code https://b.robnugen.com/mkpjapan/workshops/2019/Japanese_Journey_of_Heart_July_square_QR_code_2019.png

7. I just recently decided to plan on attending a workshop in Houston
   in October.  (ShadowWork Facilitator Training) I have not gotten it
   sorted out with the organizer yet; I asked him if I have the
   prerequisites.
8. I bought https://wanb.us/ which I might use for my Urbit star, ~wanbus.
9. I created a template for something like a Five Minute Journal
   (which takes more than five minutes, but gives a structure to what
   I write).  Kinda like a captain's log, tracking some different
   metrics: eating, sleeping, meditation, books, exercise, kisses
10. I got the idea from Hiro, who has apparently been doing it for years.
11. After doing these for a few days, I thought it would be cool to be
    able to print customized templates for people.  So if you have a
    template you'd like to print, send it to me and I can print it
    out.
12. I think my knee chair has got to go cause it might be hurting my
    knees and hips. I wanna get a yoga ball chair (again).  I will
    request one on Freecycling Tokyo.
13. It's now June 5th.  Yesterday I did my first session with Rin, and
    came out with seven affirmations, organically discovered by doing
    a (n apparently NLP) process that could be called "What do I
    gain?"
14. "What do I gain by not following my dreams?"  (snip long chain of
    answers and question repetitions featuring new answer) "I know
    people love me."  Wait, what??
15. It also makes sense though, in my experience of facilitating
    "What's at Risk" hundreds of times.  When I go through that series
    of questions, I end up with "I will be alone" (which is about the
    opposite of "I know people love me."
