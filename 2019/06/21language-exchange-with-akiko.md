Today was the second time for Akiko and I to do a language exchange.
She had some good ideas for
[Marble Track 3](https://www.marbletrack3.com) and how to market it.
I may end up creating another Instagram account; that is apparently
the way to go these days.

So happy to get another subscriber on Youtube, and enthralling to see
her enthralled with the process of animating the construction!
