I felt sad to have to check out for a significant portion of the NWTA
this past weekend.  So annoying, and certainly not what I had in mind
for my trip!

Was great to meet awesome men.  I stayed with Steve R in Vancouver the
night before the weekend, and am now staying with Dave M in Victoria
the night after the weekend.  Headed to Houston tomorrow via Calgary.

Hopefully will get to see Marty and M and M twins in Houston!
