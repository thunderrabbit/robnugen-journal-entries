I am on the non-infamous Delta flight 166 from Narita to Seattle on
which nothing of consequence happened....  except I got a Bailey's
Irish Cream because it had the word cream in it and I thought I might
like it.

It's good!

I watched Christopher Robin movie which was cute.  I considered
watching _Bohemian Rhapsody_ again but my first viewing last month or so
caused the music to rattle around in my head for weeks afterward, and
it is even back now as I write about it.

I started _Green Book_, but did not finish it because it got going too
slowly.

Was going to watch episodes of _The Good Place_ but the only have the
first 8 episodes of season 3, and not the (spoiler) last few episodes
of season 3.  I watched episode 1 of season 30(!!) of the Simpsons.
Amazing the same voice actors are doing the characters.

Okay back to sleep for a bit because it is 5am.  I think I will stay
awake after I wake up, which should be around 7am Seattle time.
