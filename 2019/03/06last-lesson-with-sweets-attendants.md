Today was the last lesson with Sweets Attendants.  (Their office is
being shut down at the end of this month, but I am leaving next week
for three weeks overseas.)

I met Tomoko at CPK at 11am and helped her carry pizza to their office
where we had a party, including candy I bought from the conveni ond
3F.

The party was fun, but afterward I unfortunately let myself get
sidetracked into dealing with some work related Excel spreadsheet
crap, but got it sorted out by moving the spreadsheet into Google
Sheets, where I can use the `=FILTER()` function.  Why can't I use
such a function in LibreOffice?

That took an hour out of our 4 hours allotted, but then I got to chat
with Midori for a bit about her plans.  At the end of our time
together, I went to the front desk and received a small white wooden
box with four drawers that I plan to use for Marble Track 3 parts.
Tomoko had apparently brought it to the office and apparently does not
want it anymore.

We stood to say bye to a bunch of guys leaving the conference room
right around the time that I also had to go.  That had me trapped a
bit longer than I wanted, during which time I wanted to reiterate they
can ask me for references or whatever they need for job search.  After
the conference room cleared out, I headed out and Tokyo-waved while
walking out the two sets of glass doors.

Gosh I am going to miss the sweets party attendants!
