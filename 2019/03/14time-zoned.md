I vaped for the first time.

##### 01:28 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT

I think it has been 20 minutes.  Let's see:

##### 01:51 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT

yay!

##### 02:00 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT

I sometimes think I feel it more if I talk.

Life is Improv

ate a brownie

My dad said I am a responsible person.
If anything goes wrong, I am responsible.

Okay finally kicked in after another hit.

##### 03:18 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT

Was able to floss my teeth in 4 minutes but it felt like a lot more in
some ways.  I ate coconut clusters and brownie, and finished eating,
and (an hour) later finished flossing, then my teeth are clean, and
now about to pee.

##### 03:26 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT

Finished peeing and now cannot quite finishes sentences all in one go.

That seemed like 50 years until this timestamp from the previous one.

##### 03:30 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT

Oats is flossing his teeth and laughing that I made his name Oats to
protect his identity.

##### 03:32 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT

Super great to talk with Oats and type at the same time.  Time is
really going slowly in one direction and in this typing direction, the
muscle memory of my typing allows me to keep a good hold on what I
know to be the correct direction of time.

##### 03:33 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT

This seems like it has been a long time with Oats flossing and keeping
track of which tooth he is flossing.

##### 03:34 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT

My computer is the size of an imax that is real far away.

While this seems like a long time, it is a short time according to the
timestamps.

##### 03:37 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT

Oats wife calls this flinging when the bits of food fly from his
dental floss.  How long has he been flossing?

Why are all these timestamps almost the same?

##### 03:37 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT

Why don't I go lie down?

Billions of years later
