In preparation for this trip, I started my packing list a few weeks
ago.

I had planned to copy it here, but for now, just imagine it.

I pre-packed most of the list a couple days ago, getting down to
computer, phone, and other
stuff I could not pack because I use it daily.

This morning I woke up early, and repacked everything, doublechecking
the list, and taking pictures of all of it, in some kind of just in
case scenario that will not happen.

This morning Lin drove me to the old man skin clinic to get a bit of
cream for my leg, and then met me at the Narita-bound Limousine Bus
stop at Shin Yurigaoka station.

We enjoyed lunch at Ootoya then hopped on the noon bus, which arrived
in Narita by 2pm.  So sweet of Lin to come with me!  We snuggled and
laughed in the back of the bus, then wandered around Narita for a bit
after I exchanged 10k and 20k yen for 105 CAD and 175 USD,
respectively (plus a bit of yen change).

We got soft serve ice cream and then wondered at all the shops in the
airport.

Sat down for about 30 minutes for more snuggles and then finally time
to say adieu.  After going through customs, I called Lin through Line
and waved bye to Lin looking down through the glass as I stayed in
place, walking up the down-escalator until someone else came.  (Almost
no one in line at security / customs.)

I got a quick pass for my new passport so I can whiz through
immigration in Japan until 2023.

Now I am at the gate, just a few minutes before boarding begins.
