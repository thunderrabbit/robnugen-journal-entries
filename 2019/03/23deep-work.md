Tonight men supported me doing a deep emotional piece.
little boy all alone,

* take care of your mother
* figure it out
* you are alone
* you're a little man

Felt vibrations in my body which come up when I do deep work.
Vibration and tingling in legs stomach arms face lips.

Trust fall was so spooky, hard not to self-facilitate.  Josh took all
the stuff I have been carrying on my shoulders.  Plus he took my extra
self-facilitation.

Time was a mystery and men waited for me.  Men supported me.

Floating like on a sea, with a sea of supportive loving faces around
me.  Walked with purpose into the closing circle and announced (I am
Thunder Rabbit, and I am love."  Was going to melt into the circle but
then ackowledged "I know you men waited for me, and I got a lot.
Thank you; I am still vibrating."

Now I am wondering why I tried to do a major process just before
closing circle, but I better just let it go and trust it's okay.
