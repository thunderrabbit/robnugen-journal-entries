We went to Hopscotch, which had interactive exhibits and a ball pit.
A *ball pit*!!  Fred and I did a skit for Peter's birthday,
alternately falling down into the ball pit and looking for the one who
had fallen.

Sandra batted balls back as we threw them to her.  We swam along the
bottom of the pool, which featured LED flooring.  Lotta lotta fun.

On the way out, Sandra was recognized by one of her classmates from
university.  Great to finally meet Sandra.  I told Fred I definitely
approve.

Dude came over on Monday and we walked to a nearby pizza place.
Apparently Dude's older daughter is now driving.
