Been sick as a dog for most of it, but I have had a great time hanging
out at Michael Monkey's in Houston.  Thanks to Great Granny Good Witch
for driving me to the store today to buy clothes and toiletries which
should last a good while.

I have made a good start on the puzzle in the dining room, first
expanding the table, then adding more white backing, then rotating the
inner white backing to reduce waste.

Enjoyed chicken soup, fried chicken, orange gatorade, orange juice,
and chocolate.

Got a sense of what it would be like to have US political news on all
the time, and am glad I do not have that option in Japan.  Brain
overload!
