#### Barefoot 1: walking

    Will you carry your shoes?
    How will you carry them?
    Do you need to wash your feet? Where will you do that?
    How will you wash them?
    What if you get injured?
    Do you have a helper to remove splinters or glass?
    Do you need to bring socks?
    Where will you walk?
    Can you abort in the middle?
    Is it likely safe?
    What's the temperature?
    
    Let's walk!  How does it feel?
    Is it like you expected?
    What did you expect?
    Flex your toes. How do they feel?
    Do different surfaces feel different?
    Are there differences you didn't expect?
    How about different materials? Textures? Colors?
	   (White paint and black asphalt are quite different temperatures in the summer!)
    
#### Barefoot 2: grounding
	
Now that you've gotten used to it, how does it feel in shoes versus
without?  Ground yourself into your body, starting with your feet.
Feel your soles touching the ground. Find your body connected to your
feet.  Feel energy coming up from your feet into your legs.  Feel
energy in your 腹 coming up from your legs.

Allow the idea of grounding to allow awareness of your breath.  Notice
how you breathe.  Notice your thinking while you notice your
breathing.  Notice your thinking while you sit.

Sit for fifteen minutes max each day.  Notice old messages and new
ideas in your mind.  Write down new messages.

#### Barefoot 3: inspiration

Write down new messages while meditating.  Write down new messages
while walking.  Notice messages while barefoot vs while shod.

Do you hear them more or less at different times of your day?
Different phases of your energy/activity?

What is the overall thrust of the income messages?  What scares you
about the message?  (If nothing, it's probably not juicy enough.)

What's a step you can do toward accomplishing the message?

What support do you need to do the step?

#### Barefoot 4: creation

Take the next step. And the next. Allocate some time to take more
steps.  Keep on stepping forward.
