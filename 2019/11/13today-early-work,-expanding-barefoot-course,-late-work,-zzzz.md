Sometimes I end up with several itty bitty entries with more meta data
and title than content.  This entry is designed to be used all day.
As of this writing, the title does not include the date, so I will add
that. brb.  Hmm that reads weirdly, but not too bad.

#### Hoon 101

This morning I said hello on Hoon 101 chat board on an Urbit planet,
and just now got sidetracked reading the messages about people excited
to join and just how to join the notebook.  Urbit is not yet meant for
the masses, and it's hella fun to be with other explorers in the
optimism of creativity as opposed to the whatever of FB.

#### early lesson

I am on the train from 登戸 to 川崎 stations.  I sit on a train that
departs from Noborito, which offers me an extra 30 minutes to sleep,
or in this case play on Urbit and write journal entries

#### barefoot course

I wrote a draft last night of my barefoot course.  I am planning to
work on it for 2 hours this week.

#### late work



#### zzzz
