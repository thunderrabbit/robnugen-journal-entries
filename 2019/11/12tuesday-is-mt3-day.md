My main plan each Tuesday is to do two hours of livestream while
working on Marble Track 3.

But first, I got Landscape working on my urbit planet, thanks to [~bannum-magtus](https://bannum-magt.us/)

Next step in that vein will be to get DNS pointing to it and then
https.

But now, MT3 livestream yay
