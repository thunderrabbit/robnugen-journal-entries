Nice lunch with Anuj at a Chinese restaurant near the back side of
Kawsaki station.  We talked about technology, what we do for work,
what I am beginning to do for work (facilitation), SOGO, and possibly
hanging out in December.

On the way back, we noticed this hornet(?) on the ground. He did not
look particularly safe to me, so I put him on a tree.  I really am not
sure if the hornet would prefer to be in the grass (protected from
wind) or what.  Sad to imagine he will die soon, but at least now not
as likley to be squished to death by a shoe.

No pics now until I get wifi.
