Last night Will took some pics of me in a tree.

We met before attending mixed gender circle.

Afterward talking with Christine, I look forward to working with her
and Petya early next year!

Today I mostly worked on MT3, doing over 3 hours of livestream.

Jimmy was on the chat and helped me name [El Lifty Lever]().  Thanks
Jimmy!

Then I watched too much crap on Netflix.  Finished The Dark Tower and
then watched first episode of a show like Another Rapper, like a Who's
Got Talent for rap.

Headed to men's circle now.  I do not really want to go though.  In
this case, I just wanna sleep; I think it is better if I go.
