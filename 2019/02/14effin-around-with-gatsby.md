A man named Fust has recommended a new stack for Marble Track 3:
Airtable as backend, Gatsby as frontend, and some other things I have
not heard of.  Actually I had not heard of Gatsby.

I have an old VirtualBox sitting around so I spun it up and loaded a
Gatsby demo.  It pooped out a bunch of deprecation warnings, so I am
loathe to really dig into this thing if it will be an ongoing battle
against a bunch of deprecations ongoing during the project, as well as
making the marble track itself.
