Tomoko invited me to join 今さん and peeps for badminton.  They play
monthly at the Kawasaki something something Center, down 区役所どり
from JR Kawasaki station.

I had so much fun that I did not notice a blood blister formed and
burst while playing!  I gave the raquet back and was like, "oh hang
on; lemme wash that blood off of there" haha oops.  I knew it was a
bit sore, but did not noticed I had worn all the way through the skin.

Miyako joined after a while.  She has to work tomorrow so chose not to
go out with everyone afterward.

I went out with everyone afterward, and the waitress did a good job
dealing with all our myriad orders.  Her voice reminded me of Mila
Kunis, the actress who plays Meg in Family Guy.

Tomoko said they would probably stay out until 2am or so so I went
home by last train.  I was able to sit down (and sleep) on a train
that terminated in 登戸 and in a train that terminated in 新百合ヶ丘.
