In the first adult lesson at JB, we flexed some reported speech
muscles with Side By Side book 1, where the target language is "This
is a photograph of my son Bart.  He is riding a skateboard outside our
house."

We changed it to be "This is a photograph of me riding a skateboard in
from of my house" and then "That is a photograph of him riding a
skateboard in from of his house."

In the second adult lesson, Hide and I told Yutaro to look up WTC7.
Yutaro was 8 years old on Airplane Day (, the name Fred and I use for
the day).

In the last lesson, students came in one by one.  We talked about
movies for a bit and then read a brief story about a couple who gave
away a lot of their lottery winnings and thereby did not let the money
change them.  Kaori listened to it twice without reading.  Kyoko and
Misato both listened once and then read along the second time.

New vocab:

* ruin
* indeed
