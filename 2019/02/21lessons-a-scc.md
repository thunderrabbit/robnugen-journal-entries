Today (and most Thursdays) I taught at SCC in Kawasaki.  Naoko
reviewed for her test next week.  Yasu reviewed the same material for
his test sometime in the future.  Azusa did much better with her
fluency and intonation for her presentation.  Liliko asked about the
brochure that has to change soon to accomodate new opening times.

After the lessons I went to say HI to Tomoko and Midori, but Midori
had the day off.  Tomoko showed me how to RSVP on Circle Square for
next month's badminton game.
