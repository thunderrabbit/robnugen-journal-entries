Marble Track 3 is not my #1 priority; I am happy to work on it slowly.

*) Rewriting in Gatsby / React makes sense if I can learn along the
 path to creating it.  How do you feel about going slowly, to help an
 old newbie learn along the way?

Basically, I do the work, learning along the way, you get a per
month retainer, for minimum 5 months?

*) What income streams do you see for Marble Track 3?

*) I got a gatsby-driven blog skeleton going, but have not integrated
Airtable.

*) I ain't sold on Airtable yet; I was not even able to get a Hello
World working after 35 minutes of poking around at existing templates
and staring at the interface

*) currently I have scripts that make different image sizes (2 for
now, but more can be easily added)  Where do images get stored in your
setup?
