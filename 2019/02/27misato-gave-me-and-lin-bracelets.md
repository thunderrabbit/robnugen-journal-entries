So surprised when Misato gave me and Lin matching tiger eye bracelets
today!  I had commented on Misato's bracelet last week (and apparently
praised it too much!) cause it caught my eye, and I had never seen
dark tiger eye before.  Super striking!

I guess this means I should buy her something kinda special from my
trip.

I probably should have gotten a picture of our matching bracelets.
