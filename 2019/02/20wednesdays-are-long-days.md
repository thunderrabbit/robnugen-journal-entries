Finally figured out why the sorts were not working on AB; I changed
the way GET parameters were cleansed and did not set it to cleanse all
60 required to deal with 20 DataTable columns.  Now it works and is on
the live site.  It is apparently working well, but AB will have some
change requests by tomorrow night.  We will discuss them on Friday.

Right now I am in a free lesson at work; usually-consistent-Hide did
not come to class, and Shinji and Akiko rarely come to class.

I am zooming through some Gatsby JS tutorials to get ready to talk to
Fust tomorrow about possibly redoing MT3 site with Gatsby.
