Today was the 3-weeks-out meeting for we staff of the
[New Warrior Training Adventure](https://nwta.mkp.org/)
([NWTA](https://nwta.mkp.org/)) in British Columbia, Canada.  It was a
good meeting; we each have a buddy and each man on the call checked in
for his buddy, with the presumption that the buddies have been in
touch with each other.

I was inspired after the call and reached out to my two teams via email.
I look forward to meeting everyone!
