<p>Whooo!  Just got a call from Swa'vet who I met at Kinko's while she
helped produce <em>Dirty Third II</em> back in like May or so.  Wow!!
So great to talk to her again and she might come see me in Japan in
like November or so!  How awesome would that be!</p>

<p>She's worked on two more movies, one similar to "Ghost" and one
called <em>Panther</em> about a female super hero.  I don't remember
much more than that.</p>

<p>I told Swa'vet the story of me meeting her and Juni and Greg and
Steve at Kinko's and then me and Fred seeing her et. al. about a week
later when she cracked me and Fred up, "stop fuckin' around and call
me tomorrow!"</p>

<p>Didn't tell her the part about meeting Wissam and oh man I forgot
his name and he was the one who wrote me back!  Something with a C.</p>
