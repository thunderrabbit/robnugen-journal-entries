<p>You know those little fresh breath strips that melt on the tongue?
Well I pulled out my little pack and found that all the remaining
strips were fused together.  It had been nearly full.</p>

<p>Meh.</p>

<p>I popped them all in my mouth.</p>

<p>WHooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!  Now that's
<em>hot!</em></p>

<p>I'm in orientation now; we're filling out lotsa paperwork and stuff
on Japanese forms, with careful instructions including a new way to
calculate our birthdates.  My Japanese birthday is year 45 of the
previous emporer's reign, March 25.  Of course if I knew the name of
the previous emporer, then I'd say his name.  1/2 penance point for
me.</p>
