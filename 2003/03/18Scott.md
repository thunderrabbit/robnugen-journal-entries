<p>Have just gotten back from applying for Josephine's passport and
transferring Scott's title to Janette.  Effectively to Josephine but
she doesn't have a driver's license yet.  Stuff like that.</p>

<p>On the way out of the Dallas Records building (Courthouse?) I saw a
news truck so I asked the guy in the truck what was the big news.</p>

<p>"There's a water fountain in there that says 'whites only'"</p>

<p>Holy shit.</p>

<p>He downplayed it as worthy news, but I'm thinking dammmmmmmmm.</p>
