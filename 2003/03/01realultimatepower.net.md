<p>Oh jeez</p>

<p>I've been reading <a
href="http://www.realultimatepower.net/">realultimatepower.net/</a>
for the past while now.  SO FUNNY!!!!!</p>

<p>I got sidetracked after trying to fix my email after installing OS
X.2; I found an email by Hannah the Gangsta from Memphis pimping this
awesomely hilarious site.  Well, a lot of it is awesome and hilarious;
some of it is just poopoopeepee humor that Phat Pat may find funnier
than me.  The CNN articles (search for "sued" in Hatemail section) are
pretty funny.  More funny that people thought they were real!!!!</p>

<p>Most amazing of all: his guestbook gets a hit about every 30
minutes it seems.  Amazing.  I wrote</p>

<BR>Hilarious and keep posting whatever kind of crap you want, but you
better keep it funny or i'm going to come kick your ass with some big
butter-slathered frisbees and ninja boots and a huge totally awesome
website about cool stuff.
<BR>
<BR>People who are freaked: it's a joke.  The CNN articles are faked.
There's a lot of stuff on the web.  It's up to you to use *your* brain
to discern its validity.  Teach your kids this basic skill they'll
need in the internet age.
