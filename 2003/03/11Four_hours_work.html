<p>I worked a while this morning at Wolf Shop.  Just cleaning up with
William, who did some cleaning up, but mostly ran off talking to
people whenever he could.  New today:  I suggested repairing the dust
and scrap catcher on the radial saw so William screwed a piece of 1/4
inch plywood over the hole in the thin masonite-like stuff.  I used
some wide yellow tape to help smooth the transition.</p>

<p>Also, I plugged in the vaccuum near the other radial saw.  This
vaccuum thing proves that vaccuum cleaners don't have to be loud.  I
sucked up a lot of saw dust and some little scraps of wood that
clanked on the fan as they passed through to the bag.  Hmmm; I wonder
if that's good or not.  Probably not too good.</p>

<p>No more work likely until Friday.</p>

<p>I've wondered about going to Houston with Janette for the rest of
this week.  I'd like to see my dad, and some other cats down there.</p>
