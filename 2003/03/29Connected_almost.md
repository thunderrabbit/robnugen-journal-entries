<p>I'm at Virgin Megastore, with English music and announcer over the
loudspeaker.  Fiona said this is where they have an internet cafe and
she's exactly right, but the cafe opens at 11am.  However, the
computers are all wirelessly connected.  So I should be able to
connect right now.  They even have three different wireless signals to
choose from.</p>

<p>BUT! Each one requires and password, and the password is not
"virgin" for any of them.</p>

<p>Nice. I got some phat time online chatting with peeps and reading
lots of emails and replying to some.  Many people who want to keep
getting my updates!  I replied to those that were particularly funny
replies.</p>

<p>I gotta split and buy chapstick and meet Andrew, Cookie,
et. al. under the four story clock at the building where Nova is
headquarters!</p>
