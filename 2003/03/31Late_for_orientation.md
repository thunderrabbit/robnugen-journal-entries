<p class=date>10:04am JST Monday 31 March 2003</p>

<p>Looks like I'll be a bit late for orientation.  But Frank said his
didn't start until 35 minutes after the specified time.  Matty said
his did start on time.</p>

<p>Both of them indicated that Nova peeps would be quite forgiving on
this first official adventure on the rail system, so I'm not too
worried.  Next stop is mine.  Well, next stop is where I transfer to a
new train for 7 minute ride, then 10 minute walk to get to the
orientation by 10:15am to be on time.</p>
