<p>Munched breakfast down in the restaurant; I don't know if it coulda
been free because I had a room, but it was an actual buffet, not just
a continental breakfast like at a small US hotel.</p>

<p>1600 yen for any of omletted eggs, runny scrambled eggs, ham,
sausage, tender beef & veggies, hash browns, croissant, fruit bread,
pineapple pudding, chocolate cake (for breakfast!  "Japan is great!
Give us the chocolate cake!"), peeled hard boiled eggs, corn flakes,
peas, ripe bananas, orange slices, apple slices, noodle salad, coffee,
tea, milk, orange juice, tomato juice, and grapefruit juice.</p>

<p>I tried to take cues from those around me on polite table manners.
It seemed that they used the same plates to get more food, and more
people had both hands/wrists on the table than one hand in lap.  No
elbows on tables. No one threw food or climbed on the table; no one
shouted or stuffed whole bananas into their mouth.</p>

<p>No tips left on tables, but a wait person would pick up all the
used dishes and stuff.</p>
