<p>Grrrrrrr.</p>

<p>Nine Inch Nails' backwards N is stylized and intentional.</p>

<p>A backwards N in the word GENERAL of a painted sign</p>

<pre>
RESERVED TICKETS  $6.00
GENERAL ADMISSION $6.00
</pre>

<p>is not stylized, nor cool, nor intentional (I hope).</p>

<p>It's just plain dumb!  Doesn't anyone else see the sign?  See that
the N is backwards?  Argh!</p>

<p>And then there's an EXIT ONLY sign with *another* backwards N!!
What the hell is happening to my old high school?</p>

<br>I used to have a backwards N in my name, but got tired of people telling me that it appeared to intentionally
    stylized. It took a while to get used to the change, but as we all know, change is essential.
