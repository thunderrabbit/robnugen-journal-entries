<p class=date>11:05am CST Sunday 23 March 2003</p>

<p>About two weeks ago I got an email that included "The job sucks,
but Japan is pretty good." from someone.  I figured he was just a bit
cynical maybe, didn't like teaching people the same thing over and
over or whatever.</p>

<p>So I was all, "meh," and decided to still respect the company and
want to do the right thing and buy the right clothes and just amaze
the fuck out of them about how awesome an instructor I'll be and have
everyone love me <em>the most</em>.</p>

<p>He subsequently told me what type of clothing was appropriate, but
not what shoes, so I asked what type of shoes were good to wear.</p>

R,

Any kind is fine. Slip on slip off is pretty much the standard. Have
more than one pair so that you don't wear them out; plus it rains alot
and you will need an alt when they get wet.

I don't know what your work experience is like, but be ready to take
some shit and produce a terrible product. Many of the NOVA teachers
have drinking problems. You can never say you were not warned.

<p>Woah.</p>

<p>That's the first chink in the armor....  </p>

<p>Ya know, fuckit; I still haven't seen it for myself.</p>

<p>I don't mind posting the above possibly incriminating email because:</p>

<p>1) free speech</p>

<p>2) no one at Nova likely reads my site</p>

<p>3) sounds like if they fire him, he won't mind</p>
