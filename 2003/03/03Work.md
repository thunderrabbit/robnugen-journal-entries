<p>Whoah.</p>

<p>Such a hard day at work.</p>

<p>And not done yet.</p>

<p>Lots of lifting.  Heavy lifting.  Lots of parallels, decks, plywood
- scads of playwood.  And lots of masonite.</p>

<p>Gotta unload parallels now and then we're done.</p>

<p class=date>5:19pm</p>

<p>Nevamind.</p>

<p>Everyone split; we're going home.</p>
