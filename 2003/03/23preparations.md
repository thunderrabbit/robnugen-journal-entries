<p class=date>10:23pm CST Sunday 23 March 2003</p>

<p>Tonight I showed Janette the clothes that I bought with Fred's
input yesterday.</p>

<p>She liked them.</p>

<p>I just realized like *oh shit* just realized I gotta get cash from
my bank, but I use an electronic bank with no edifices (edifi?) to
visit and be like, "gimme my money."  I called my bank and they found
an ATM close to me that they own and which therefore will not charge
me fees to withdraw copius quantaties of moolah.</p>

<p>Going to meet my mom tomorrow in Waco and hopefully she got my
message to bring the ties and clothes that I archived with her at the
beginning of my adventure.</p>

<p>Right now my to do list looks approximately like this:</p>

<p>I've noticed something after getting that email from Frank.  I have
a sense of relief, of .... something that means I'm not quite as
intimidated by my upcoming job situation because they are just people
too.  If these cats have drinking problems, then that's just fine.  I
can have a I-don't-really-know-how-to-match-clothes problem, or a
I-haven't-been-studying-Japanese-very-much problem, or some innocuous
thing like that.  I'll be just <em>fine</em>.</p>

<p>Plus, as Janette has said a few times, "you can always come
back."</p>

<p class=date>11:44pm</p>

<p>Speaking of Janette, she's sleeping beautifully, and I'm going to
begin painting a painting for her.</p>
