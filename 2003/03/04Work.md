<p>Work was hard today, but not ridiculously hard, nor even actually
really hard; I seemed to have been in just a rush to get shit done
slash please Johnny slash impress people with what a good worker I am
slash just get finished so we can go home.</p>

<p>Plus I'm still kinda tired from previous days' work.</p>

<p>I just realized one reason that I meticulously record minute
details in my journal; those details are what triggers my memory to
recall the actual event instead of just reading it as a story, or just
a set of feelings; those don't really help me recall the specific
event, or they haven't in the past.  Or I haven't really tried.</p>

<p>[{(On the way driving to Bossier City with Johnny on Saturday he
suggested that emotions aren't "stored" somewhere until we feel them
so much as they are timeless, or they exist in a timeless space in the
universe.)}]</p>

<p>Anyway, the details for today:  We set up a show at Market Center
or something like that, a huge room with tall white walls with lumps
all over and air vents sticking out quite boldly.</p>

<p>The stage was tricky; a diamond shape pointing at the audience and
on a slight incline so it more fully faces the audience.  This meant
careful arrangement of the legs on the decks for the stage, and they
were color coded but not carefully put in the truck, so it took some
doing to sort them all out.  Plus the slants were subtle so at first
we were putting them on randomly backwards or forwards.</p>

<p>(Right now we're at ZuZu's and the people at the table across from
us are pinching their elbows, marveling at how it doesn't hurt.)</p>

<p>Enough about work.</p>
