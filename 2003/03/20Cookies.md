<p>Been working on my days old cookies, and I thought I had the code
to a place where it would work, but... it's not working.  Only trick
is that I'm not sure how to debug my output, and I don't yet know
where the cookie file is located for my browsers (Safari and IE).  A
bit of research can find those quickly, but I may have lost impetus on
the project.</p>

<p>Oh oh oh</p>

<p>I just realized I can set my browser to warn me of incoming cookies
and thereby see what's happening behind the scenes.</p>
