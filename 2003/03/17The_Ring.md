<p>Yikes I gotta remember to wish Maggie and Molly Happy B-day tomorrow.</p>

<p>Watched <em>The Ring</em> with Josephine between Janette and I on
the bed.  They didn't watch the part where the girl climbs out of the
TV.  I did.  It wasn't nearly as scary as first time I saw it in the
theater.</p>

<p>I was right that they didn't show Noah's fucked up face at that
scene, but I was wrong because they did show it later.</p>

<p>Phat Pat wouldn't watch the movie, but he watched the after movie
outtakes/scary-extra-footage.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>I am tiiiiiiiiii-red</p>
