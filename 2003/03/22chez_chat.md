<p>Chatted online with Chez and then called her to just yammer about
funny stories and stuff, ..  I told her about the Alphabet Game and
she told me about a mad libs (on computer) rap and rapped the first
3/4 page worth of it (out of 6 pages).</p>

<p>We decided we'll definitely write to one another while I'm in
Japan.  None of this "I'll write you!" and not do it.</p>
