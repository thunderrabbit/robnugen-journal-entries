<p class=date>9:59pm CST Tuesday 25 March 2003</p>

<p>Okay.  I've archived junk from my old wallet, purchased everything
I think I'll need, archived my 2002 taxes (sent them in today via
turbotax.com ($19.95)), printed my flight info, my arrival info,...
now it's time to pack.  But first I need to unpack the boxes and bags
that have accumulated here at Janette's while I've been here.</p>

<p>She's hemming my pants while I do that.  I can do it.  On my mark,
get set... go!</p>

<p class=date>11:59pm</p>

<p>Done unleashing all the boxes; starting to pack now, but first I'm
going to call or email Colleen for her birthday.  Sooo tired I'm
becoming.</p>

<p class=date>2:52am</p>

<p>Now I've finished my garment bag and nearly finished the suitcase.  So far I've packed:</p>

11 pair dark socks
10 pair light socks
10 ties
9 slacks
9 undies
8 long sleeve shirts
4 belts
1 suit: pants, coat
1 pair boat shoes
1 pair hard black shoes
1 pair slippers
1 pair soft black shoes
1 rain jacket
1 GAP hoodie

<p class=date>4:19am</p>

<p>So close, but I can't find my passport.  I had it just a while ago.</p>

<p class=date>4:33am</p>

<p>Ah.  I put it in the pocket of the pants I intend to wear tomorrow.</p>

<p class=date>4:45am</p>

<p>Finished packing for the night.  Gotta be at the airport in 2 hours.</p>

<p>Gonna send out a mass email.</p>

<p class=date>5:12am</p>

<p>And by mass email, I meant email to Josephine about Scott.  Okay,
now mass email.  God I'm so tired.</p>

<p class=date>5:34am</p>

<p>Sent.  I'm going to upload these journal entries, pack up my
computer, sleep maybe.  Maybe not.  I dunno that I really have time.
Thankfully Janette has been sleeping; she'll take me to the airport.</p>
