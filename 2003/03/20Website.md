<p class=date>6:25pm CST Thursday 20 March 2003</p>

<p>Have done some cleanup on my website; consolidating or reorganizing
some things that have been written and just moved from site to site
like old boxes of treasures that I can't bear to throw away.</p>

<p>One mind says bits are cheap, might as well keep them.</p>

<p>There's a part of me that wants to keep and archive and store
everything I've thought, somehow creating a collage of Who I Am
through my writings and recording Who I've Been in my adventures.</p>

<p>But it gets to a point where it's like shit, who cares if I keep
Every Thought I've Ever Thunk; no one is going to read them all.  Not
likely.  Well a sentient computer would.  Google will if I ever make
them all linkable.</p>

<p>I've decided it's all important enough to make a backup of
everything on my local computer.  I've been copying things for almost
an hour now and it's not all backed up.  I'm not clear that it will
finish before we leave for Austin tonight.</p>

<p>Man I've got a lot of files on my site.</p>

<p class=date>7:03pm</p>

<p>Didn't get it all copied.  We're on the way to Austin now with
Charity driving, Janette shotgun, me in a nest of blankets in the
front of the back of the van, and a bunch of stuff filling the back of
the back of the van.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  Interesting.  I transcribed not very much of my first
handwritten journal and started to get a little bit ookey stomach
feeling carsick.  Combination of reading in bad light/writing/bad
posture/shake shake shake sitting sideways in a van without really
looking outside may have had something to do with it.  Gonna lay down
now.</p>
