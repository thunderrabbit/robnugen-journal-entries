<b>Email & the Internet:</b>

A lot of people are under the impression that Japan has been wired for
years.  In reality, computer based communication is only now becoming
commonplace.  ...  You will not have access to email or the Internet
through Nova.

If you wish to get connected you will have to take care of everything
yourself.  Internet service providers are becoming more and more
common and the average price is about 3000 yen per month.  Companies
such as CompuServe and America Online can also be used in Japan.
