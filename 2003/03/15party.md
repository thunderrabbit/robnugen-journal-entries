<p>This party has been great.  I put a banana in the freezer. Casey
Jones, Colleen Crotty, Joel Brazzel, Richard Hermerding, Mike Holcomb,
Heather Hall, Tyler Keith, Skyler Nelson, Edward Lerner, Jackie Purdy,
Laura Caddell, Laura Douglas, (her friends Kelly, Yasmine, Gavin),
Lawren Miller, Doc (Dan Owens), Ben Batschelet, have all been here
during the party, oh and Josephine, Jack, Janette, me.</p>

<p>Silent football was fun.  Richard lost.</p>

<p>Janette made an incredible cake!  And spaghetti and other stuff.
Cake was for Colleenie Beanie's birthday.  Big big thanks to Colleen
for driving all the way up from Corpus!</p>

<p>Big fun climbing all over trees in the park.  I didn't fall.  Nor
did Laura, though she did some cool tricky climbing.</p>

<p>Walked to the lake with Mike, Joel, Lawren.  I jumped inside the
white boat house thing, trying to leap 4 feet over water to a 10 inch
strip of concrete, and I basically made it, but had to use the wall
for balance, but I hit the head of a nail and bruised a rib pretty
effectively.  Ouch.</p>

<p>Joel and I climbed all over the toys in the playground, and I
schooled him in climbing (no hands) over the caterpillar thing, and he
"schooled" me by wrenching me out of the swing (he was on the ground,
so the outcome was inevitable)</p>
