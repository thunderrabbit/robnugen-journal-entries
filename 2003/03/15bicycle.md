<p>Dammit.  Some of these lovely kittens rode my bike today and the
pedal was all loose and instead of .. nevermind.  Anyway, the bolt
that holds the pedal to the crankshaft is now missing.</p>

<p>I've lost plenty of my dad's tools and stuff in my time.</p>

<p>Release, release, release.</p>

<p>Oh, these guys rule.  Ed and Casey found the bolt.  Awesome.</p>
