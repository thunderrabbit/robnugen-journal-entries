<p>Lawren came over today (after church I guess).  So awesome!  We
chatted a bit and she drove me to Movie Trading Company to get a used
copy of _8 Mile_ and then we stopped at MJD Designs and got paints and
paper so I can paint for Janette.</p>

<p>Really awesome that she took time to come over once more before I
go.  I'm so lucky to have people around me who love me!</p>
