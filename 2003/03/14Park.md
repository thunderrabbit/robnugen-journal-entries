<p>Janette and I walked around, including going to the park and
climbing on a tree.  I jumped between branches and slightly scrape/cut
my stomach on a small nub of a branch.  Cut it through my shirt so
that's pretty cool.  Two slightly bloody scrapes.</p>

<p>We played king of the hill on a concrete thing with a manhole cover
on it, but the manhole cover was not exactly stable so I moved us to
play king of the patch of green grass so we wouldn't fall through the
manhole and die.  Janette won pretty handily on the concrete thing
since I was being way careful.  We were about matched on the grass,
but she got conked in the chin by my shoulder so we quit and I
piggybacked her out of the park.</p>
