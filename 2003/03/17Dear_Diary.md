<p class=date>4:37pm CST Monday 17 March 2003</p>

<p>Today I, well last night I put some pictures on my website from the
weekend and one from the New Years party.  Phat Pat and Mike Holcomb
(no e) watched.</p>

<p>Today Laura Douglas and Kelly, no Callie, no you're right Kelly
came over.</p>

<p>OH And my rant for the day:  The fucking Texas Department of
Transportation website has a PDF with a blatant grammar/logic flaw.
The top of the page is has text like "I hereby understand that I am
filling this out.  If you fill it out wrong, you are still liable."</p>

<p>"I" and "you" in the same paragraph both refer to the same entity.
Same paragraph!  Same bold typeface; same everything!  It's fucked
up.</p>

<p>I'm doing errands with janette; we're looking for a phone and I
have faxed to Nova my Certificate of Eligibility to work in Japan!</p>

<p class=date>5:34pm</p>

<p>We're at Target; selected a phone and looked for T-shirts with cool
tags that I can photograph, enlarge, print on the T-shirt itself.
Preferably with color images of apples and shit <em>and</em> symbols
representing washing machines, dryers and irons <em>and</em> multiple
languages.  Oh, and the right size.  Didn't find most of those
requirements all on one side of one tag on one correctly sized
shirt.</p>
