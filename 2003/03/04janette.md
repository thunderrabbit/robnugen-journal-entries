<p>Yay!  Janette is home!</p>

<p>She was watching clouds when I arrived.  Thanks to Janette for
reminding me of simple pleasures in life.</p>

<p>"Oh look!  That cloud looks like a man painting an image of a
forest with mountains in the background while his kids are playing
baseball in the yard!  Hey, now it's a dog."</p>
