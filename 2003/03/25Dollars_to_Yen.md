<p>I've just converted ~ $610 to 68000 yen.  Almost enough for one
month's rent.  Nice.  There are a lot of zeros on each bill.  I have
some 10,000 yen bills now.  Five such bills I think.</p>

<p>Hoping Janette makes it home soon so she can join me to the
Galleria to get more $ exchanged. I coulda gotten there myself, but
she wanted to go too.</p>

<p>Did it.  The Galleria location had 70,000 yen.  Maybe next time
I'll plan ahead more and make fewer transactions, costing less
money.</p>
