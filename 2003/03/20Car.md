<p>Jack and I are fixing Heather's car tire.</p>

<p>We're at Ross New-Used Tires next to a loudspeaker on a rumbling
small diesel behind an open manhole cover.  On the truck is what
amounts to a large chinese finger trap, certainly used to grab long
things and pull them.  But I don't know what types of things those
would be.</p>

<p>That was fast.  $20 for an $18 tire and $3 balance.  Nice.  The
operation there was smooth, without the structure of NTB or other big
chain.  One cat talked to customer, asked what tire(s) need
adjustment, put a jack under the affected tire, (possibly) another cat
removed the tire, bounced it to the back, (possibly) another cat found
a tire, changed it, bounced it back to the car, (possibly) another cat
put it on.</p>
