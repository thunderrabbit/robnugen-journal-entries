<p>Called Steve's cellphone at Austin Rally.</p>

<p>Fred described lime groovy juice -&gt; groovy juice pie -&gt;
groovy juice icing.  Now he's doing homework</p>

<p>Asha was the spokesperson at their social action thingy!</p>

<p>Ben will be co-dictating with Katy Burnette-Hughes tonight.  It's
his last Austin Rally.</p>

<p>Mike Holcombe... d'oh I forgot what he said.</p>

<p>Erin phuufed Ben!</p>

<p>Katy seems sane despite being in charge.  She says the Foons won
the Spork vs Foon contest.</p>

<p>Rosemary is chillin' with her homies and has met some new
friends.</p>

<p>Richard and Ed were the Foon special forces and Rich fought off 10
Spork people at once.  He'll bring groovy juice recipe to the 14-16
March party</p>

<p>Ed's implant broke and he has cool mirrored shades.</p>

<p>Calder is having a good rally.  Then the phone died while she was
talking to me.</p>

<p>Thanks Steve, for letting me run your battery down!</p>
