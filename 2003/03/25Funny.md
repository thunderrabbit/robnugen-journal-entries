<p>Two funny things today: one just now.</p>

<p>Earlier:</p>

<p>Janette was all, "I'm hungry.  Maybe we can order Chinese take-out.
Do you like Chinese food?"</p>

<p>Me:  "yeah!  why do you think I'm going to... <em>*OH SHIT!*</em>"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Just now Janette was helping me pack.  Out of the closet, she got
my suit and shoes, the ones that I bought for several dollars in
California.  She opened the shoebox and saw each shoe in its own cloth
sack thing.</p>

<p>&lt;gasp!>, she gasped, "Shhh, they're <em>sleeping</em>!"</p>
