<p>Tiiiiired.</p>

<p>Janelle looks a lot like woman from Something about Mary.   DAmn
that's how tired I am; I can't think of her name.</p>

<p>We got phones after work.  I have a phone now.  I don't have the
number memorized, and it's way across the room so I'm not going to get
it now.</p>

<p>The phone has a camera on it and so many features that I couldn't
even figure out how to save names on it, nor even how to make a phone
call!  Now I know why Frank was all, "I just want one fuckin' feature
on my phone: <b>ring</b>."</p>

<p>Frank helped me save names on it.</p>

<p>Got home, Matty, Frank and I went to Miho's restaurant.  Miho is
the name of a waitress who speaks pretty good English, has a great
smile, and is quite friendly.  I don't know the actual name of the
restaurant, but they just call it Miho's cause of her.  We got a pile
of food for 1600 yen each.  Frank could tell all the different types;
I'm too tried to fuck with it now.</p>

<p>I'm to work for the next year in Kawasaki, about a 30 minute train
ride from where we live.  It's apparently a red light district, so
maybe I can soon confirm the existence of vending machines with used
girls' panties for sale.  I wonder how a red light district might
affect my addiction.</p>

<p>We stopped by DVD/CD rental place and they're watching a DVD now.
I fell flat fucking asleep on my bed in my clothes until Frank
hollered at me to see if I want to watch the movie with them.</p>

<p>Cameron Diaz!</p>
