<p class=date>1:25pm JST Friday 28 March 2003</p>

<p>I paid 500 yen for lunch (plenty to eat) and walked to my new work,
which is on the fifth floor of a five story building, the bottom two
stories of which are filled with a pachinko parlor.  Big half naked
sexy cartoon characters on signs out front lure people in.</p>

<p>After looking around the Nova classroom space (four or five small
rooms and only 2 being used) I walked to my apartment for the first
time.  The guy who I'll be replacing answered the door and I got to
see inside a bit.  Small.  Have to duck my head to get into the main
living area.  I didn't see my room because Frank was sleeping in there
aparently.</p>

<p>I got a letter!  The winner of the First Letter To Rob in Japan
contest is Colleenie Beanie!!</p>

<p>I ate my lunch by the river under a bridge (over which I'll cross
each day as I take the 15 minute walk from my apartment to work)</p>

<p>Now I'm on the train back to my hotel.</p>

<p>I still don't have the train system perfectly figured out.  I keep
getting buzzed like my tickets are invalid, but I'll keep trying
various options until I figure it out.  Most recently I decided at the
last minute the train I almost boarded was in fact the correct train,
but the doors were closing and smushed my hand as I tried to bully
them open.  "Sorry about your hand, but the train can't be late."</p>
