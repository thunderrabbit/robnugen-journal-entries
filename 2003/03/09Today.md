<p class=date>12:15am CST Monday 10 March 2003</p>

<p>Went for a wonderful long walk with Janette.  Talked about us and
me leaving and will we ever see each other again, I hope so, but
things change, and I want you to do whatever is best for you, and
don't do anything just for me, and you're the best thing since sliced
bread, and people change and you might meet someone who is more
perfect, but who knows.. just let it flow, let yourself go.  slow and
low that is the tempo.</p>

<p>All of that except for the line from "Slow Ride" was out sitting on
the rocks by white rock lake and on the grass by the old water factory.</p>

<p>This was the day we climbed the stairs of the tower (10 steps; 1
pi), Janette correctly guessed (after a couple tries) what the
lightning-grounding cables were down the side, the day I walked along
the wall and on the inside of the fence at the spillway, and when the
guy had two very male dogs playing fetch in the expressly forbidden
area of the spillway.</p>

<p>Played on my website; now the WTF pages email address is randomly
selected from a list.  I may use that technology in other places.</p>

<p>Went to see _Chicago_ with Josephine again.  Janette and Jack
joined us; it was their first viewing, my second, Josephine's 4th.</p>

<p>Talked to Lawren online; she'll hopefully be able to come to the
Bibby Blowout on 14-16 March.  You're invited if you know me and
(Janette or Jack or Josephine)</p>
