<p>"I better say something meritable so Rob will write it down."</p>

<p>"What a world where the leading rapper is white, the leading golfer
is black, the French think Americans are arrogant, and the Germans
don't want to go to war."</p>

align="left"> So GREAT to see my mom again.</p>

<p>I told them what I knew about my apartment, my city, my roommates,
etc etc.  Yammered a bit about the stupidity of war and the
awesomeness of Macs.</p>

<p>At first I was like "erg" and didn't want to drive all the way to
Waco just for lunch, but something about being so frustrated by the
phone made me really really really appreciate seeing ma.  Gave her a
bigger hug than ever because of that phone.</p>

<p>She brought a pile of my clothes - lotsa rally t-shirts and many
ties and I don't know what else.  I thought there might be a suit in
there but I don't see it.  No worries; I only need one.</p>

<p>I'm home now.  _8 Mile_ blasting on stereo; house is empty of
people and so <em>clean</em>!!!</p>
