<p>I'm in Japan.  Just met Andrew, a cat from Sacramento.  He's been
on a trip across Asia (Laos, Burma, Thailand, Taiwan, Macau, Viet Nam,
Hong Kong, NZ, OZ, Samoa, Tonga), has a brother in Hawaii.  He'll be
staying Kokubunji in Tokyo.  He requested Chiba and got Tokyo.  I
requested Tokyo and got Yokohama.  That's hilarious.</p>

<p>He also journals, emails them out to his peeps.</p>

<p>Awesome!  He just got back from Auckland New Zeeeeealand!  Was
there for 18 months going to school.  Wowza!</p>

<p>He's trying to get a citizenship in NZ.</p>

<p>Have also met Kevin & Janelle (married, will be placed in
Ichihara), Ryan (I think that's his name (he broke his hand snow
skiing)). And others others others.</p>

<p>Our person who met us here (Cookie, but I think he spelled his name
for me Kwok) looks like a Japanese version of ... ooooh I can't think
of his name.... UU YA cat up in Oregon, and he has a British
accent.</p>
