<p class=date>10:30am PST Wednesday 26 March 2003</p>

<p>An official looking woman stood near the entry of the plane on the
jetway.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" I ask, trying to appear optimistically
curious rather than WTF??? like that.</p>

<p>She goes, "I'm escorting somebody."</p>

<p>"Ah.  You look very official.."</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> very official," she assured me.</p>

<p>"Anyone I've heard of?"  I asked, <em>obviously</em> referring to
whom she may be escorting.</p>

<p>"INS," like that was the end all answer to all conversations about
<em>anything</em> official.</p>

<p>"Ah," (no no who are you escoring?  Nevermind, it mustn't be anyone
famous.) I boarded the plane.</p>

<p>Seat 48K, the finest gold <em>ever</em>.</p>
