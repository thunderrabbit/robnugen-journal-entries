<p>Weeeeeeeeird.</p>

<p>I am exactly 99.9% certain I'm at the right restaurant.  The
directions include:</p>

<ol><li>go to Waco (did that)</li>
<li>exit Lake Shore drive which might be exit 340 (I exited Lake Shore
drive which is exit 341 but highway 340 is at that intersection)</li>
<li>go east (did that)</li>
<li>find a Mexican restaurant close to the freeway called El Capitan
or something. (I found a Mexican restaurant close to the freeway
called el Conquistador; I think that's close enough.  Starts with "El
C," has a vaguely similar conotation, Captain is more common a word in
English that Conquistador, and she said "or something")</li>
</ol>

<p>But ma is not here.  She's not normally late for things that I know
of.</p>

<p>I tried to call her cell phone, but the pay phone won't let me dial
it.  I tried the operator, and she got the same "number is
disconnected signal".  I tried not dialing 1.  (It said dial 1)  I
tried three different numbers in Austin.  I tried Janette's number in
Dallas.  All go to the same "number is disconnected" after I dial
1+area+prefix.  I don't even get to the last four numbers.</p>

<p>I went to a different payphone in a different building.  Same
thing.  I'm going to ask around to see if I can borrow a cell phone
from someone.</p>

<p class=date>1:56pm</p>

<p>Short story: I couldn't call collect to ma's cell phone.  Tried
three different carriers.  No one was home at Janette's (I tried to
call collect her phone).  I dialed 0 and they couldn't help.  Dialed
00 and they couldn't help.</p>

<p>I dialed the number listed <em>on the phone</em> "call if you
have problems or complaints," and <em>they don't service this
phone!!!</em></p>

<p>I tried 0 to find out who I complain to but she didn't know, or
maybe something else.</p>

<p>I was so boiling with frustration I was dialing 0, preparing to say
calmly, "I am literally going to destroy this phone if you do not get
me connected to this number now.  I will destroy it and walk away and
it will be a hella lot more expensive to you guys than making this
simple phone call."</p>

<p>So great to hug my mom after all that.</p>
