<p>LEVEL ORANGE SEARCH IN PROGRESS sounds pretty menacing to me as we
approached the entry gates to the airport, but the search consisted of
one person with a flashlight peering into the car from one side
only.</p>

<p>What could they possibly find that way?</p>

<p>Fucking Airplane Day.  Stealing from me 2 hours of time that I
could otherwise use to chat with Janette.  She's stuck behind the
glass, behind the security gates.  The X-ray guy saw a knife looking
thing in my bag and it got checked.  Letter opener.  They let me
through with it.  It's not a sharp letter opener.  It's made of
silver; hand made.  By my dad I think.</p>

<p>I waved to Janette once I made it through.  Thanks to her for
staying; I could have given the opener to her to take home.  I watched
her turn quickly away once I appeared focused on walking.  She floated
down the escalator.  Bye Janette for a year maybe.  Unless you come
visit.</p>

<p>So now I'm crying.  I'm leaving my home for a year, to a foreign
land I've never previously visited.  What the fuck am I
thinking???</p>
