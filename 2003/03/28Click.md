<p>Ah.  Something significant clicked for me in figuring out the
subway system.  Just poring over the maps, and the arrival pack
information about where I'm supposed to go and how I'll get there.</p>

<p>This will be easy.</p>

<p>Just gotta learn some kanji.</p>

<p>D'oh.  I still can't figure out how to display kanji in my HTML.
Well, specifically I can't find an editor on my computer that will
write kanji in a plaintext.  Gotta figure out some encoding
stuff.</p>

<p>Okay, go go go go forget typing kanji for now.</p>
