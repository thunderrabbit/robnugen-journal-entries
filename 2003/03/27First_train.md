<p>On a train with Andrew (Dru Daddy G), Justin & Tara (married) who
will be placed in Sendai.</p>

<p>We're being spoon fed train tickets and such for now.  This ride is
just over an hour it turns out.  Assigned seats.  I know the symbol
for car (train car only?) now.  It looks like the top view of a
formula car with axels, but no wheels.  Or a sideways tie fighter even
though Andrew refuses to watch Star Wars.</p>

<p>I'm in Japan!  I'm in Japan!  I'm in Japan!!!  How is it not really
sinking in?  Andrew was all, "yeah, no matter where I go, I wanna go
somewhere else that sounds cooler," or something like that.</p>

<p>"But now you're stuck here for a year..."</p>

<p>Most amazing is how clean this place is!  And people with colds
wear little white masks like surgeons to keep from spreading germs.
Almost like a fashion statement.</p>

<p>D'oh!  I just realized I left my hat on the plane.  Like a dark
green Gilligan hat.</p>
