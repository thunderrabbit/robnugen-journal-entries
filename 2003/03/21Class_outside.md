<p class=date>2:54pm CST Friday 21 March 2003</p>

<p>We're outside for Fred's 3pm class talking about logarithms.  He's
showing them how to multiple log base 2 of 6 X log 4 base 6.  Turns
out that it's log 4 over log 2.</p>

<p>We've eaten lunch and such, oh and he told me that he's decided to
buckledown and study for the qualifiers and pass them and be accepted
into the PhD program here at UT.  yay Fred!!</p>

<br>Actually, I'm in the PhD program in Math at UT now, and the decision was to buckle down and *continue* in the PhD program, rather than jump to Civil Engineering or move to another university.<br>
