<p>Janette and I, in our continued pursuit of acting like teenagers,
are sitting on the bank of the river in Austin.  Glorious sunshine
zero clouds.  Bright enough to read my computer screen without using
the backlight.</p>

<p>She's pricing objects for her space in the antique shop, and came
across some hand mirrors.  She was all, "want me to blind you?" as she
reflected the sun onto my shirt.</p>

<p>"Not really," and I grabbed another mirror and reflected it onto
the trees in front of us.</p>

<p>Like two little fairies flitting about the branches our reflected
light beams danced around, chasing each other, jumping from tree to
tree, up and down the trunks, chasing behind and in front of people
walking along the riverside path...  Man we're so funny!</p>

<p>She priced a couple of the mirrors like "Green Sun Mirror $18"</p>

<p>So now when she gets her sales sheet at the end of the month,
she'll remember the story.</p>
