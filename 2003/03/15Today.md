<p class=date>11:11am CST Saturday 15 March 2003</p>

<p>Past couple of days I've been playing around on <a
href="http://www.geeky-boy.com/cgi-bin/bbs_thingie">bbst</a>, which
Laura, Steve, Gail, TDK have kept intact and now some old Castle of
Dreams people are showing up, triggered by Nim finding me online by
searching for "Thunder Rabbit" Good times; I wonder if I'll stay on
bbst for a while.  I wonder if Janette will find it fun enough to chat
on it.</p>

<p>Josephine and I are going to go driving now.  I wonder if any of
the kittens want to go with us (and if she'll be okay with that).</p>
