Subject: PS: Congratulations on Exam 2; Richard graded it for you.   

When Richard was here in Austin, he helped me add up the points and
enter the grades.  When I got to your name (at the bottom), I said,
"How many points should Rob get?"
&lt;pause>  "Two hundred n' ten."

That was the grading process.

I wonder how long it will be before someone asks me about it.
