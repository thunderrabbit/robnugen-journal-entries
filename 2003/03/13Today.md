<p class=date>3:32pm CST Thursday 13 March 2003</p>

<p>Went to see Maggie for lunch and now am at Transco Tower with Janette.</p>

<p>Aw man...  The observation deck is closed since fucking Airplane
Day.  Now think about this.  Why is it closed?  So I won't direct an
airplane into the building?  So I won't carry 10,000 gallons of jet
fuel up there and light it?  Doesn't make any fucking sense that I
can't go up because some airplanes hit some other towers.  Fuck.</p>
