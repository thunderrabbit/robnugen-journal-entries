<p class=date>5:22am JST Sunday 30 March 2003</p>

<p>This morning I've tweaked the home and wtf images to make them more
closely resemble the others (raised home so it will appear on the same
level, changed font of wtf) and I created a japan image, by cutting
and pasting existing letters ktru bumper sticker style.  Hey I wonder
if I have a w, t, and f from other images that dude made me back in
the day.  Yes I do.  I may use those letters, but probably not now.
I'm going to take a nap again.  So I can maybe more easily stay up
"late" to a normal time tonight in my new apartment.</p>
