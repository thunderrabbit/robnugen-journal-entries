<p>I've been up for an hour.  Many things in Japan are beautiful and/or
functional:</p>

<p>(!) Made green tea with the little tea brewing set on the desk.  I
put the tea pot on the electric burner, pushed the on button.  Few
minutes later, the water was boiling, but I couldn't figure out how to
turn it off.  Pushed the ON button again and that didn't change
anything.  I hoped I hadn't just reset a timer to heat it for five
minutes or something.</p>

<p>Picked up the teapot and it turned off.  I verified that it wasn't
just coincidence.  When I pick up the pot, the heating element turns
off.  Nice.</p>

<p>(@) There are three pushbutton switches and a clock built into the
headboard of the bed.  One switch turns on/off the overhead light.  One
turns on/off the light above the bed.  One turns on/off a little light
at the base of the headboard, perfect for illuminating the way to the
restroom at night, without being too bright in sleepy eyes.</p>

<p>(#) The toilet is a marvel in itself.
<br>(&) sit on the seat and the bowl begins to fill with water, rather
noisily, possibly to politely cover any splashing noises of one's own.
<br>(&) finish the job and then press the button labeled with a
picture that looks like water spraying up at a butt.  Guess what it
does?  Warm water to clean, and a pressure adjustment that spans from
not-enough-to-reach to water-fountain-out-of-control all the way past
the bathroom door (not that the door is all that far away in a small
Japanese restroom).
<br>(&) and then a button labled with water spraying up at a seated
woman produces a gentler, wider stream of warm water aimed for the
vulva (or testicles)
<br>(&) the seat and lid open easily, but they make no noise when they
close.  Ever knock the lid down on a toilet at night, causing a huge
clatter and possibly waking up the entire house?  Not here.  The seat
and lid each descend softly and silently shut.</p>

<p>(*) There's a flashlight at the bottom of the headboard (for use in
case of earthquakes).  It turns on automatically when taken off its
hook and off automatically when placed on its hook.  How?  The tube of
the flashlight has a slot cut into it right where the batteries
touch.  The hook slides into that slot, both pushing the batteries
apart and holding the flashlight in place.</p>
