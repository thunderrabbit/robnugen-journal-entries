<p>Today, um..  oh I got my new glasses!  I'd put a picture online but
I wanna just write for a bit and not get too sidetracked.  They are
cool and don't have metal around the lenses, just nosepiece and
earpieces that are attached to the lenses</p>

<p>Today is the day we went to war on Iraq.  Far as I know, we haven't
actually attacked Baghdad, but Bush has led us into a corner so we
can't do otherwise.  It's all fucked up.</p>

<p>Watched 13 Ghosts last night.  The old old version, hailed as a
classic presumably for its ghost-viewing or ghost-non-viewing lenses
and creative advertising back in the day.</p>

<p>Awesome time romping around with Janette and almost got her on
BBST.  Close.  And she made awesome chicken soup.  It amazes me still
that she actually <em>makes</em> chicken soup.  When she said, "I'd
like chicken soup" and left for the store, I was thinking of cans of
soup.  Swear.  I've lived here for months and I still think canned
soup when she says chicken soup.</p>

<p>Josephine declared today as Color Outside Day.  So we colored on
the rock walkway out front.  Laura Douglas and Jack came home during the fest
and Laura joined.  Jack did not.</p>

really looks like this" (written in the heart by Laura)</p>

this?  Guess who wrote "whut whut"</p>

rather play inside.  Excellent likeness by Laura.</p>

<p>I worked a while on cookies to save dates on my days old counter.
Closer, but not finished quite yet.  I think I know what else I need
to do, but it's basically time for bed bed bed.</p>
