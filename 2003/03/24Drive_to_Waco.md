<p class=date>10:31am CST Monday 24 March 2003</p>

<p>I'm going to see my mom in Waco (1.5 hours away) today!  And...  oh
she's bringing me some ties (I hope she got the message; I archived
some ties with her when I began my homeless life) and I bought a few
ties at Ross.</p>

<p>Oh and I gotta pack!  And get dollars changed to yen.  Lotsa
dollars!!  Lots more yen!!!</p>

<p>But..... I don't leave until Wednesday...</p>

<p>Aw yeah..  I've got plenty of time.</p>

<p class=date>12:18pm</p>

<p>See?  I'm already in the restaurant 45 minutes early.  I like being
early, but I don't necessarily need to be *this* early to be happy.
Maybe 10 minutes.  But hey, plenty of time to write.  Maybe I'll
compose my first mass email that I plan to send.</p>
