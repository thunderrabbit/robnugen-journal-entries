<p>Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>If I understand this little card correctly, Eminem is playing
somewhere in Japan on May 23rd and May 24th!!  Could it be?</p>

<p>Yes, it could.</p>

<p>Is it?</p>

<p>I don't know.  But if Cookie does in fact meet us (me, so far)
here, I'll ask him, and ask him to help me purchase tickets for the
show.  I hope I can go!  I won't quit my job over it, but I'll
definitely ask for the evening off.</p>

<p>Whoooo!!</p>
