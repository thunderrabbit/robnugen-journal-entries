<p>I'm a legal alien
<br>oh, I'm a legal alien
<br>I'm a legal alien
<br>in Japan</p>

<p>(almost)</p>

<p>I'm at the ward office in my local area to get registered.  Made it
here from the train station with the handy dandy map Nova gave me.</p>

<p>Total tons of information pouring into my brain.  Brain in high
overdrive doing huge amounts of pattern matching and memorizing
matches.  Brains are pretty awesome.  I like mine.</p>

<p>Oh, a cool thing was getting my photo taken in a little photo booth
by the train station.  Luckily there was an image of a passport photo
(complete with dimensions describing how big it should be) and I
matched the japanese name on the image to an item in a list of names
on the screen, apparently describing the types of photos to be
taken.</p>

<p>After the picture was taken, I hit not the green button but the do
it over button, so I was a bit surprised when it wanted to take my
picture again though I hadn't paid again.  But I figured out what must
have happened and pushed the right button to get the photos.</p>
