<p>I got my <a href="/cgi-local/days/daysold.pl">days old counter</a>
to correctly save cookies.  It's not *perfect* in the user interface
department, but good enough.</p>

<p>Got my entire site copied to my local drive.  I think it's all
copied.</p>

<p>Emacs is doing some crazy shit with highlighting and I don't know
what's the dimdam deal.</p>

<p>Oh shit I figured it out.  I had named this journal entry
days_old.pl because .pl was so stuck in my brain.  Silly brain.</p>
