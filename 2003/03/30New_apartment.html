<p>I'm in my new apartment.  Adrienne is from London, though she
considers Japan her home now.  Her husband's mother can make 300,000
yen (per sitting?  per day?) at the pachinko parlor.  Wow.</p>

<p>Adrienne showed me the difference between an express train and
limited express and the local train.  Limited express is even more
express than express (limited means it stops at a limited number of
stops compared to the express)</p>

<p>Got to my apartment and neither Matty nor Frank are here.  They'll
be in around 8 and 9 respectively.  Adrienne helped me set up my futon
including a pillow with beans sewn onto one side of it.  Quite soft
and lovely.  Plenty big enough to sleep on, I think, though I haven't
actually lay on it yet.</p>

<p>She said the place is bigger than she expected.  It's plenty big
enough for me.  It's about the size of my apartment on West Gray in
which I lived for 11 years.  The living room and refrigerator here are
a bit smaller than there, but it will be just fine.</p>
