<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I cannot fucking believe it's 2am.</p>

<p>I'm at a loss to capture all the hilarity of hanging out with Frank
and then hanging out with both Matty and Frank.  Frank is hilarious.
He's from Jersey, has spent years in the army, fuckin' loves his
country, says the USA is the Capital of The World, grills the shit out
of his students, especially on race issues (e.g.: "If you go to the
US, you better not go to the south cause they will kill you."
<br>" ... why? ..."
<br>"Because you're fuckin' asian, man, they hate asians
and they'll kill you!"
<br>"... but that is not fair ..."
<br>"you're damn right it's not fair, so why do you hate the Chinese
and Koreans?")</p>

<p>Brutal.  I wonder if he likes the Jim Roam Rome whatever show.</p>

<p>There's more.  I shoulda had a fuckin' tape recorder.  I can tell
that I won't likely be watching my language here.</p>

<p>Matty is a Brit, pale and tall and has to duck signficantly to go
through any doorway in the apartment.  He gives me three weeks before
I start liking asian girls.  (I'm like "no way.")  He likes Christina
Ricci over Ally McBeal, and harasses Frank for Frank's patriotism.
"They's been nothing goo to come outa new yok except the Beastie
Boys."</p>

<p>Matty also likes Eminem; we're going to go to the show presuming I
can get the night off.</p>

<p>Oh, but you know what?  They both laugh when I said I assumed I'd
be working at the Nova location closest to my apartment.  Frank does
work there, but he's an anomaly in that regard.  Matty has to commute
like 45 minutes to work each day.  Frank wakes up 40 minutes after
Matty has left so they can both be at work at the same time.</p>
