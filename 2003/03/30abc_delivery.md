<p class=date>7:11pm JST Sunday 30 March 2003</p>

<p>I hope I haven't fucked up too badly.  Adrienne suggested that if
ABC doesn't deliver my luggage by 6:45 that I for sure call Nova and
they would track it down.  They all leave Nova at 7pm. But I fell
asleep until just now and I don't know where to find a phone except a
5 minute walk away.  But what if I leave and ABC arrives, etc.</p>

<p>My tickets say that ABC will deliver between 6pm and 9pm, so it's
likely that it will still arrive.  Also, I can hopefully wear a suit
and tie of Matt or Frank's.</p>

<p>I trust all will be A-OK with ABC.</p>

<p>One good point is that I don't see a note on the door from an
attempted delivery by ABC.</p>

<p class=date>7:28pm</p>

<p>Oh <em>man</em> I feel so tired!  I don't know what is up with
that.  Is my consciousness just shutting down as a defense against
overwhelming emotions?  Is it jetlag?  is it from my brain being in
hyper overload mode for days?</p>

<p class=date>8:05pm</p>

<p>Guess who feels more awake?</p>

<p>Guess whose luggage just got delivered?</p>

<p>Whoohooo!!</p>

<p>I actually heard the wheels of the suitcase being rolled along the
brick sidewalk and thought that must be it.  But I lowered my
expectations in case it wasn't.  But then the doorbell rang.  :-)</p>

<p class=date>8:09pm</p>

<p>Guess what's black and white and wrinkled all over?</p>

<p>My suit and shirts!  Actually the suit is pretty okay, but I gotta
iron these shirts again.  As in, I'll iron them for the first time
after Janette ironed them back at home and then said, "these will
probably need to be ironed again, but that's okay cause it's fun!"</p>

<p>Ha ha.  Good joke there, Janette.</p>

<p>Well, it's ten times more fun than not having clothes to iron.</p>

<p>Just gotta find the ironing board and iron.</p>
