<p class=date>7:43am CST Wednesday 5 March 2003</p>

<p>This morning I asked Janette if she would superglue the flap of
dead skin to the bottom of my foot (onto the new skin that can handle
superglue, but not a rock or small piece of glass).  She did and when
I got up I decided to not move my foot for a bit and then fall down
when I tried to move with my foot "stuck" to the floor.</p>

<p>While I stood, waiting for the perfect moment for my joke, Janette
was all, "I asked Josephine what she thought about me dating you," and
blah blah "then Josephine said, 'you've been acting like a couple of
teenagers for five months now.  But whatever makes you happy.'"</p>

<p>I started to crack up thinking about my joke; I could hardly finish
my tea.  Finally I got my poker face and then "I better go to work"</p>

<p>[step]</p>

<p>[fall]</p>

<p><em>[BAM]</em> against the refrigerator as I fell.</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAhahahahahahahhahaha!!  I'm so glad Janette and I share our
wonderful sense of humor!</p>

<p>"... and then I, a genius at balancing, suddenly fall...."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I've wondered about the term genius being applied to things other
than mental abilities (artistic, emotional, physical, spiritual)</p>

<p>Now I really gotta go to work.</p>
