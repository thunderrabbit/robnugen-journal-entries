<p class=date>12:28am CST Monday 3 March 2003</p>

<p>Very lazy day.  Lot of computer stuff.  Went to the local Apple
retailer to get prices on added memory.  $50 for 128 meg, $100 for 256
meg, $200 for 512 meg.  Pretty straightforward.  I've got 256 meg in
my machine now.  I don't really have $100 to double that and I'm not
going to piss around and just get 128 extra.  I'll wait until I'm
blingin' it more and get 256 at least.  The cat told me I'd get better
prices at <a href="http://www.crucial.com">crucial.com</a>, and it
seems he's correct.  Except for the 256 meg which is like $99 at
Crucial.</p>

<p>More importantly though, super thanks to Dude for pointing out the
coolness of Server Side Includes.  This will allow me to pretty
handily finish out my website, starting with my wtf pages.  oooh
Silent Football pages are almost complete; maybe I'll do those
first.</p>

<p>Anyway, wtf will be my FAQ pages.  <a
href="mailto:wtf_does_wtf_mean@robnugen.com">Ask</a> me questions
that people might ask when seeing my site and I'll maybe answer them
in my wtf pages (and send you an answer if you're actually asking)</p>
