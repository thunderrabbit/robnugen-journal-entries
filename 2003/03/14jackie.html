<p>So great to see Jacke Purdy tonight!</p>

<p>She came a few hours ago, just after Jack, Tyler, Skyler, Casey
went to see Godspeed You Black Emporer in concert.  Nice.</p>

<p>Jackie has two eyes tattooed on her lower back.  Nice.  Now she has
eyes on both sides of her.</p>

<p>Her Spring Break is just ending.</p>

<p>She's in a one act UIL play (Dance at Luthisana (sp)) and can't cut
her hair before then, but she's wavering between cutting it short
again and not cutting it short again.</p>

<p>They have a public performance in late late March or early April.
Email her for details if you wanna go.  Or email me and I'll forward
it.</p>
