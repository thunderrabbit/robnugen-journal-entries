<p class=date>10:43am CST Saturday 22 March 2003</p>

<p>Awake.  About to go shopping.  Jack has requested a ride somewhere
so I can hopefully just drop him off.</p>

<p>So funny that I'm a bit apprehensive about shopping:</p>

<p>I've never really done it alone before; I've always had a
mom/girlfriend with me on shopping adventures in the past.</p>

<p class=date>1:23pm</p>

<p>Got like 8 pairs of slacks and 4 white long sleeve shirts and some
t-shirts.  Aww yeah.  The slacks are all the right size, but I just
guessed on the white shirts.</p>
