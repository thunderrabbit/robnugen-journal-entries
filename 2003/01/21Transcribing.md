<p>I have been transcribing some old entries from 1987, when I first
started my journal.  Interesting to see my use of the word "you" when
I meant "people in general."  I used the term "messed around" or
"messin' around" a lot.  And lots of apostrophes instead of writin' a
g.</p>

<p>Also interesting to see me as a youth through my stories.  Chowing
even more ice cream than I do now.  Losing clothing and toiletries
during a camping trip.  Physically stronger than I am now.  Some
sadness that I haven't kept up that level of physique, but hey
whatever.  I am who I am.</p>

<p>They haven't been moved online yet, but someday soon they will
be.</p>
