HI Dad

I am in the process of closing my cell phone account, so unless
something surprising happens with that process, I won't have a cell
phone again until I get to Japan.

I called your home number to let you know and Karen answered, and
ultimately invited me to call you at work.  I chose not to bug you at
work over such a little thing, so I called her back, asking if she'd
let you know.  She didn't seem too happy about my having called back,
but said she would be glad to pass that bit of information on.

I do not love Karen enough to have a clearing with her, letting her
know that I feel negative energy every time I talk to her.

I do love you enough to let you know that I feel distance between you
and I since you've been with Karen.

Ironically, I'm doubly not going to call you at work to dump this on
you now, nor am I going to call Karen back to have her pass this
message on to you.

I feel really sad and just had a good cry.

	I love you
	- Rob
