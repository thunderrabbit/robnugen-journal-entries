<p>Just finished at the Dr Chisholm DDS office.  He fixed my
mouthguard free of charge.  Awww yeah.  I was all "now this is
excellent customer service" none of this, "are you going to see Wende
[in California] anytime soon?"</p>

<p>Jessica the assistant told me about her upcoming trip to Panama,
her home country, and how some of her friends were all worried cause
apparently some Americans got kidnapped there, or are missing or
something.  She was all, "I'm going anyway; I know where to go and be
safe."</p>

<p>I even got a new mouthguard case, just in case.  Different color so
I can easily remember which one contains my mouthguard.</p>
