<p>Chillin' at Dr Nellie Grose's office.  Hmm I thought I would get
here early, but I was a couple minutes late.</p>

<p>Ah well.</p>

<p class=date>11:55am</p>

<p>Talked to Dr Nellie and somehow she already knew I was going to
Japan.  I dunno how she knew.  She answered questions for me, actually
just suggested resources for how I can answer them, said I'd be quite
happy and well taken care of in Japan.</p>

<p>About passing out, she gave a few possible reasons, after she first
explained that passing out is the body's way of stabilizing blood
pressure and getting blood to the brain.  Could be caused from low
blood sugar, something else, something else, something else, being too
hot..  </p>

<p>I was all, "that's probably it.  I was wearing this [undies, pants,
shirt, hoodie] and in my sleeping bag to sleep."</p>

<p>She guessed that my blood pressure was much lower than normal to
keep from overheating, and when I got up, I didn't do so slowly and my
blood pressure didn't get pumped back up in time.</p>

<p>I like that explanation.</p>

<p>She listened to my lungs and checked my ears and tonsils.  "You
have very pretty teeth."  (Wow!, thanks!)  Patted me on the back,
"you're fine."</p>

<p>Told her how I've been learning to release my stuff and allow the
universe to provide all that I need.  She gave me a big hug for that.
"Be sure to send me a card."</p>

<p>I will.</p>
