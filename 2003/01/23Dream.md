<p>Woah.  I'm reminded that I had a dream last night.  I'm not sure if
the dream happened before or after my mouthguard cracked.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In my dad's living room, my grandpa/dentist was sitting
on the couch to my back right, and his wife was on the recliner to my
front left.  He was looking through pictures and came across some that
showed my teeth before he had worked on them to make the front teeth
all straight and such.</p>

<p class=dream>He showed the picture to grandma, and I proudly showed
her the resulting teeth.</p>

<p>I don't know how my dentist got to be my grandfather in my dream.
Maybe that is based on Wende's PawPaw being a dentist.</p>
