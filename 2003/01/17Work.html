<p>Today I looked for tables at work.  Talked to Oksana about who
sings "All that she wants"...  neither of us could think of it, but
then Sergei knew it's by Ace of Base.  I'm pretty amazed, considering
he doesn't seem like the kinda cat to know 'popular' American music.</p>

<p>Oksana is wondering how much her cellphone company charges her for
internet access through her phone.  She says she's been using it, but
hasn't been charged for it.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Mike has some images of books on a bookshelf which he's using spray
adhesive to adhere to a big yellow facade painted like... the interior
of a library.  Oksana had the good idea of cutting some of the books
separately to make them lean over a bit.  Like real books.  Very
smart.</p>

<p>I'm feelin' pretty happy today, hoping to have a great time at the
rally tomorrow and to be allowed to stay more than four hours.</p>

<p>Talked to Janette about it last night, and to Rick when he came
over.  I trust that everything will work out for the highest good.</p>

<p>He wondered flat out if J N-P would actually contact HARE for me,
since she did not follow through on some phone call/conversations she
wanted to have with people after talking to him one day.  Long story.
Also it's his story, so yeah.</p>
