<p>Saw the Japanese version of <em>The Ring</em>, which they just
called <em>Ring</em>.  If you've seen our version, stick with that.</p>

<p>The Japanese version wasn't scary at all compared to our version.
There was only one (1) thing that the Japanese version did more
scarily than the US version.  And it was actually just creepy or
spooky: to keep from dying in the American version, one had to copy
the tape.  In Japanese version, one had to copy *and* show the video
to someone else.</p>

<p>But the Japanese version didn't have any horses, didn't show the
girl in an insane asylum, didn't visit the girl who saw her friend
die, didn't have the dad kill himself, didn't show where the girl had
been kept, and the video itself was way shorter.</p>

<p>Hahaa now the kittens are talking about their "irrational" fears of
dark, boogey man, vampires, peeing in bathrooms with windows..</p>

<p>"Shit!  Both your bathrooms have windows in them!  I'm going to go
pee outside.."</p>

<p>"hey don't say all that scary stuff around Josephine, you might
scare her."</p>

<p>"Oh I think that while she's got all these big hairy boys around
her she'll be okay."</p>

<p>"hey, just because we're bigger doesn't mean our minds are
stronger; we're scared too."</p>
