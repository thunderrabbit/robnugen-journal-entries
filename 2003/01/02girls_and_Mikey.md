<p>Left the bookstore; went to Blockbuster, but they were closed.
However, some of Josephine's friends from high school drove up and
Joey was talking to them.  Tanner and/or Joel plus Mikey had some sort
of inside joke about whizzing in the radiator.  Mikey went up to see
if he could get them to open their hood, but Jo was coming back just
as he walked up.</p>

<p>So we drove, inadvertantly ended up behind them at a traffic
light.  He tried again, but the light turned green just as he got
out.</p>

<p>This happened <em>again</em> at a different light (nothing
inadvertant this time, just convenient cause we were going the same
direction), and this time they waited just long enough for him to say
something, which turned out to be "uh, have a nice ride."</p>

<p>Laughed the rest of the way home.</p>
