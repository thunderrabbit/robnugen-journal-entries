<p>Mikey and Joel cooked lunch for us today.  Quite funny to watch
them tossing veggie burgers onto sizzling hot oil and jumping back so
as to not be burned by the hot splashing oil.  They were all laughing
and having a great time.  So awesome to have such positive energy put
into our lunch.</p>

<p>Nice Laura Douglas came over; it was great to see her again.</p>

<p>Wow.  I'm totally falling asleep as I write this entry.  I don't
know why I'm so tired.</p>
