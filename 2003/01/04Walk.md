<p>Janette and Hart's mom (Mary Jane) and I just went for a walk for
about an hour.  I went barefoot, and my feet held up pretty well.
Nice warm blood vessels down in my soles prove every cell thrives.</p>

<p>Mostly they talked about their respective kids and looked at houses
as we passed them.  Lots of old glass windows with wobbly reflections
in them.  One street had particularly clean windows on bottom and top
floors.  I imagined a tall person lived on the block, did a
neighborhood service by cleaning them weekly.</p>

<p>Near the conclusion of our walk, I thought we were way over where
we weren't.  If Janette had bet me $10 on which way was home, she
woulda won.</p>
