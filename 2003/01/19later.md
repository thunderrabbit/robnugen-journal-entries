<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>On a city bus thing in San Francisco, I was riding with
LSN Hammons on a city bus/trolley thing.  The hills were like really
steep (like in San Francisco) but we didn't have to hold on to the
railings to go up and down the hills.  We only needed to go a short
distance, but the driver wouldn't let us off until the next stop.</p>

<p class=dream>At the next stop, other YRUUers were there, though I
couldn't tell who they were, but all of them were just like hi or meh
and not HI!!!!!! when they saw me.</p>
