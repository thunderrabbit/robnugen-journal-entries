<p>Josephine went to take a shower and Heather needed to get something
for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Heather was all, "Josephine?  Are you in the shower?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" Jo hollered through the door.</p>

<p>"Can I come in for a second?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>Five seconds after she went in a closed the door, I went up to it,
"Heather?  Are you in the shower?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Can I come in?"   "just kidding."</p>

<p>Then Mikey and I both went up to the door while Heather and
Josephine were still in there.  Mikey goes, "Rob?  Are you in the
shower?"</p>

<p>me: "Yeah!"  them: "No!"</p>

<p>"Can I come in?"</p>

<p>me: "Sure!"  them: WTF??</p>

<p>us: Hahahahhaahaahaahah! and walked away.</p>
