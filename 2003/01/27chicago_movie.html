<p>Mmmm Nre Fte  Nsttymotr mobir vsllrf Fuplrc.  zl

<p>shit, fingers on the wrong keys.</p>

<p>Mmmmm New Drew Barrymore movie called Duplex.  It looks stupid, but
she's in it.  And Ben Stiller.</p>

<p>View From the Top looks bad too.  <em>Chicago</em> starting
now.</p>

<p>Wow sexy start except for the smoking.</p>

<p>Interesting how there were supposed to be two sisters in the
opening act, but the dancers didn't get messed up.</p>

<p>Grr guys are so gross.  No cuddling after sex.  Bluh.</p>

<p>Bye Fred.  You bad cat.</p>

<p>"He's a disloyal husband!"</p>

<p>I shot him and I'd shoot him again.</p>

<p>Once was enough.</p>

<p>You know some guys just can't hold their arsenic.</p>

<p>He ran into my knife.
He ran into my knife ten times.</p>

<p>I guess you could say we had artistic differences.  He saw himself
as alive and I saw him dead.</p>

<p>I don't want to toot my own horn, but if Jesus Christ lived in
Chicago and he had five thousand dollars, things would be a lot
different today.</p>

<p>And now ladies and gentlemen, an act of desperation.</p>

<p>At first I thought it was too much with the guns, but then shooting
out the lights was a good finish.</p>

<p>Cute movie.</p>

<p>Poor Amos.  or was is name Andy?</p>

<p>Kristen, Kathryn, Catherine should see this movie.</p>

<p>haha there's a title called Follow Spots.  I guess their role was
to chase my cat around.</p>

<p>dammmn the neverending song</p>
