<p>Janette and I rode bikes to the bank, the library, and the grocery
store.  From the library we got _Stranger in a Strange Land_ so I can
continue reading it to her.  From grocery we got spaghetti making
items for dinner tonight.</p>

<p>Before the ride, something was bugging her; I don't know if it was
me or not.  She felt some better during the ride, but not 100% better
as she went back out alone to the park.</p>

<p>I hope she'll talk to me soon if it was something I did.</p>

<br>it's a little disconcerting to have my petulance,as well as my better qualities exposed to your reading public
    . maybe i should:<br>
)be perfect at ALL times<br>
)be more dramatic when i fall from grace so it's at least a more interesting story<br>
)accept the fate of the rich and famous
