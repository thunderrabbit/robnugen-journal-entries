<p>Joel just came into the kitchen where I'm chillin' and leaned over
kinda behind/beside me to give me a hug. "We should always give
awkward hugs, with heads in armpits; that kind of thing."</p>

<p>Joel just told us about the time that Gram pulled out his shoelace
to prove that a knot can (not) be tied with a loop or something.  The
story spontaneously expanded to Gram removing everyone's shoelaces,
"and when we woke up, he was laying in a hammock...."  So
awesome-tootin'ly funny!</p>

<p>Here's a spontaneously shrunken story: Joel was counting panties
today at work.  "Kick-ass awesome!"</p>
