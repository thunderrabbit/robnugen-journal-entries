<p>Tyler walked toward the kitchen, carrying a cup of hot tea.  Joel
grabbed his arm and yanked it back, causing the tea to spill all over
Joel's hip and shirt and such.</p>

<p>"Ahhh!!!  it burns!" through laughter as they both cracked up at
the situation.</p>

<p>The story, relayed to those who came to see what happened quickly
transformed into, "I was trying to get by Tyler so I said 'excuse me'
and he whirled around and threw scalding tea on me!"</p>

<p>So funny.</p>
