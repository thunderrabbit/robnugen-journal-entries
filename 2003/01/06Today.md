<p class=date>1:05am CST Tuesday 7 January 2003</p>

<p>My day today seemed vaguely productive, if I stretch the meaning of
the word.  I helped unload and reload the dishwasher, chatted with
Ryan about his <a
href="http://boyinthemachine.tripod.com">website</a>, and watched a
single funny scene from <em>I'm gonna get you sucka</em>, the one
starring Chris Rock where he comes into the shop asking how much it
costs for the ribs.</p>

<p>Logan and Josephine came home from school during lunch today and
had rented <em>Amalie</em> (sp).  Watched part of it, went back to
school, and arrived back at home about an hour later, saying "we're
getting back to school a little bit at a time,.... actually our
teacher wasn't there so we left."</p>

<p>I called Maggie to remind/bug her about calling UH to reserve a
room for my 12000th day party.  She called them and will hopefully
have a confirmation from them in a couple days.</p>

<p>I did not mail Bryn's guitar pin to her, but I'll hopefully do that
on Tuesday, maybe from here in Austin.</p>

<p>I'm falling asleep.</p>

<p class=date>3:47am</p>

<p>Wow.  I'm surprised at how late it is.  Time to go.</p>
