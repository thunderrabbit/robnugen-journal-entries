<p>I'm going to read Stephen King's _The Gunslinger_ to Janette.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Hahahah!!</p>

<p>Cracking up laughing as I read with my mouthguard in, which makes
my speech sound like Drew Barrymore.  (I fancy it does cause that
makes me think of her and I'm hard pressed to think of a time that I
don't want to be thinking of Drew Barrymore)</p>

<p>"The Gunthlinger"</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAH!!!!</p>

<p>Over and over until she was finally all, "okay, don't read the
title anymore."</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA!!!</p>

<p>"okay."</p>

<p>"okay."</p>

<p>"The man in black thled acloss the dethert." ahaAhahahaHAHAHAAAaa!!!!</p>

<p>AHHAHAHAAHAa</p>

<p>"okay." sigh.  "okay."</p>

<p>AHAHHAHAAHAHAHAH</p>

<p>"This is how movies waste so much film."</p>

<p>"okay."</p>

<p>"The man in black HAHAHahahahhaahahaahahhaah!!!"</p>

<p>This happened maybe 10 times; It took so long to get to the second
phrase of the first sentence of the book.</p>

<p>"The man in black thled acloss the dethert, and the gunthlinger
thollowed. HAHahaahahahahaahahahaahah!!!!!"</p>

<p>I took my mouthguard out and read.</p>
