<p class=date>8:17am CST Thursday 16 January 2003</p>

<p>I'm at the Wolf Shop, but no one else with keys seems to be here.
Mike was just here and drove off to Starbucks.  Justin is here in his
truck.  I'm considering going to the site cause the guys over there
said they'd be working at 8.</p>

<p class=date>5:15pm</p>

<p>Ann (with keys) arrived shortly thereafter.  Today consisted of
finishing up pieces (painting, etc), loading them into the truck
(piece by piece (pun intended)), installing them at the auditorium.</p>

<p>The first performance is tonight, well, later I heard it's a dress
rehearsal, but they wanted to have all the stuff in place for the
performance.  This is a play (musical?) called _Maintenance Man_,
about a cat who is a maintenace man, apparently.</p>

<p>Most fun was..... leaving.  I helped Ann install some dangly strips
that basically look like cassette tape all pulled out of the cassette,
but not tangled in a horrendous mess (yet).</p>

<p>Oh, at the end of the day back at the shop, I helped Johnny
silkscreen some more anti-war posters.  I cleaned the screen for him
(I offered) cause it's his least favorite part of screen printing.</p>

<p>There's no Wolf Shop work tomorrow, but Johnny said I can help the
anti-war movement with him starting around 10 or 11am.</p>

<p>"Now that's my kinda starting time!"</p>
