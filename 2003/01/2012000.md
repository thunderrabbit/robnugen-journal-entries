<p class=date>12:13am CST Tuesday 21 January 2003</p>

<p>I just sent out invitations to my 12,000th day party.  If you think
you wanna go, comment on this and I'll get details to you.  (if you're
invited, of course)</p>

<p>Had a silly type-o in the message I sent out "Party ime" instead of
"Party time."  Ah well.</p>
