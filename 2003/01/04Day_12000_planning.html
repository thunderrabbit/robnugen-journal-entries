<p>Argh</p>

<p>I'm like totally frizzled on what I'm supposed to be doing.  Gotta
list a mile long of important but not urgent things to do.</p>

<p>!) Mail guitar pin to Bryn</p>

<p>@) send out email to people inviting them to my 12000th day, but
this is a balancing act between waiting until I have information from
Maggie about when the room is reserved and other specifics, and not
waiting too long to send out the message, and collecting all the
addresses to whom I wish to send invites, etc etc.  Plus, ironically,
I'm having som trouble getting my emailer to work the way I think it
should.  I guess it's not designed to mass mail people.</p>

<p>and then I get stuck no longer writing out my list, but working on
this email list.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>alright.  I think I got that working.  I need to call Mags and see
if she has more info for me.</p>
