<p class=date>9:34am CST Sunday 19 January 2003</p>

<p>I slept during the last remnants of silent football and during
cleanup.  Russ woke me up around 8am to get my shiznit cleared out and
then hit closing circle.  The youth invited me to do Aristasha one
last time.  I did so gleefully.</p>

<p>Now it looks like basically everyone is cleared out and many have
headed to Denny's.  I'll join them now.</p>
