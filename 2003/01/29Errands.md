<p class=date>6:41pm CST Wednesday 29 January 2003</p>

<p>Ran errands with Janette, including getting wire mesh to cover a
hole in the attic where a squirrel has been visiting, using insulation
to make a nest.</p>

<p>We were careful to not disturb the nest, which included little pink
hairless *<em>cute</em>* squirrels.. like 4 of them about 3 inches
long each.  They made little not quite squeaking, not quite groaning
noises when we were messing around with our new screen to cover their
screen.  The nest was between the outer slats of a vent and the screen
behind it.  Apparently the mom squirrel had chewed through the screen
and collected insulation, then packed it back down between the screen
and slats for a nest.  The nest was apparently complete, considering
it had little squirrels in it, so I trust that she won't need any more
insulation from inside the attic.</p>

<p>So we blocked the hole and I hope the babies will be okay.  They
are sooo cute!</p>

<p>We also cleaned out a bunch of shit from the attic to throw away
and some to give to Good Will.  Wonderfully productive day.</p>
