<p>I'm at the airport to pick up Janette and Charity after they set up
a restaurant in Denver.  I think I'm just outside the right gate to
pick them up; I hope so; I moved the car twice to get lined up.  Even
drove the wrong way in the parking lot so I wouldn't have to go all
the way around again.  Whoo.</p>
