<p>I just Fibby McFibfibbed to Discover, trying to get a 0% balance
transfer thing with them.  Told them I owned my residence (that's
a euphamism for "I have free room and board") and that I'm self
employed (euphamism for "currently unemployed"), and that I make
around $38,000 per year (euphamism for "I have a job lined up that
will pay 3,000,000 yen per year").</p>

<p>Catch me if you can; I'll be in Japan!</p>
