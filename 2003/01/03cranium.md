<p>The kittens went to a thrift store and came back with Cranium, the
four team game that pits different random talent-ish things against
one another.  Janette, Mikey and I were winning pretty handily.  The
other two teams seemed to be fighting pretty handily.  Were we finding
the limits of YRUU comraderie?  7 days together in basically one house
might stretch such bonds.</p>

<p>The game was abandoned before finished.  "this is a dumb game..."
Tanner, Mikey, Janette, Josephine and I played a couple rounds non
competitively, just to practice the skills: drawing with eyes closed,
modeling with clay, etc.</p>

<p>Now some of them are going to a different thrift store, and some of
the others are going to play disc.  I'm choosing not to; it's too
cold!  And practically dark.</p>
