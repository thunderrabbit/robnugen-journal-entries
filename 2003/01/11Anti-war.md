<p>Sean came over, preparing for Ultimate.  Somehow he saw that I was
wearing his ultimate shirt.  I was sleepin' and only the corner of the
shoulder was visible.  I'm so glad he was able to find it!</p>

<p>Just now he came back home (after having left with Jo, Jack,
Richard(?)) for the game; he forgot his cleats.</p>

<p>I'm in Janette's van, letting it warm up before I go to the Wolf
Shop to help with anti-war stuff.  Preparing for the rally in DC.</p>

<p class=date>3:32pm</p>

<p>Been silk screening posters after we ate lunch.  Taking Ann to her
house now.</p>

<p class=date>7:01pm</p>

<p>We probably finished 600 posters, each 1/2 poster size.  I've never
silkscreened before, and today I spread the ink stuff on 1 (one)
poster and did a pretty perfect job.  But I was way faster at loading
a new sheet of poster under the silk thing while Johnny would spread
the ink.</p>

<p>Several other people were there; we shared jobs of cutting posters
in half, loading them under the inker, inking, laying them out all
over the shop to dry.  600 covers a lot of space!</p>

<p>Oh, remind me to tell the story about Johnny the Blasphemer.</p>
