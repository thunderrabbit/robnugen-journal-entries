<p class=date>11:41am CST Thursday 2 January 2003</p>

<p>Informal gathering for breakfast; everyone is not even awake yet.
But Tanner, Ryan, Matt, Skyler, Celeste, Josephine, Jack, Heather, and
a quiet sleepy Hillary in the chair all collected around the table for
quiche: 2 with spinach, onions, cheese, and 1 of just bacon.  Funny is
that when she poured eggs into the pie things, there wasn't enough
liquid to cover them up.  We laughed.  True to Janette's low stress
nature, "we'll just see what happens."</p>

<p>Funny = Matt's Chef Cookie Jar, with French accent, "HauHAAuu!!
Keep yor hands aWAY from the cookie jah!"</p>
