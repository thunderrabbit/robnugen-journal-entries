<p>Spaghetti supper was awesomely delicious, especially with bread
that we got to twist into various shapes.  Janette braided her loaf,
and I made a twisty ring and a pretzel shape with mine.  The spaghetti
sauce was awesome with fresh mushrooms, zucchini, and oregano in it.
Wow.</p>

<p>I converted my spaghetti into alfredo spaghetti by adding a big
blop of ranch dressing.  Yummmm eeee.</p>
