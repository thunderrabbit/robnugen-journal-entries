<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Someone speaking some dialog for a movie, maybe Sean,
but she was a girl.  We were filming a movie and basically didn't have
enough script so were trying to go over old script again in a
different way to make it seem longer.</p>

<p class=dream>I woke up and Joel was beside me.  He had been sleeping
in a weird position; weirder than Marty McFly in <em>Back to the
Future</em>.  I talked to him a bit, asking him how he slept; he said
just fine, and then he was gone and I was talking to Ricky Shaw, of
Shaw Chevron down in Houston.  He was fine as well and looked forward
to seeing me at my party.</p>

<p>Then I woke up for real.</p>
