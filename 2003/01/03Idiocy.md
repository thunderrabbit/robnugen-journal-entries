<p>What is the fucking deal with Bush and foreign relations?</p>

<p>He's all riling up troops to go fight in Iraq when the UN is all,
"we found nothing" and Bush still wants to go fight and 'liberate' the
Iraqis?  And then what?  try to fucking take over their country under
the guise of aid and westernize it and end up destroying another
culture with our white plague?</p>

<p>And at the same time Korea is all, "hey yo we got bombs!" and Bush
is all, "oh, we'd like to be diplomatic about this."</p>

<p>What The Fuck???</p>

<p>Is Bush mad cause Saddam was going to kill his dad?  Yo dubya, call
your daddy; his ass is still alive.  Go shoot a bunch of fucking deer
on your ranch and let diplomacy work with Iraq *and* with Korea.  Be
wise, not a fucking war monger.  Let the UN discern weapons in Iraq.</p>

<p>I'm not all brilliant about this shit yet, but dammm; this
situation is pretty fucked up.</p>
