<p class=date>9:27am CST Monday 27 January 2003</p>

<p>I rolled in to the Wolf Shop around 9am I thought, but it seems
like I've been there chillin' more than 30 minutes.  Whatever.  Johnny
wasn't there at first.  He called Ann saying that aliens had abducted
him and he thought today was still Sunday.  haha.  Ann was all, "that
means he's rolling around in bed with a woman."  I probably shouldn't
implicate Ann like that, but oh well.</p>

<p>Anyway, Johnny rolled in and after some chatting with Ann,
ultimately determined that he didn't have work for me yet this week,
but should later in the week.  Cool.  I have plenty of LJs to read
still.  I got through about 30 entries and am still 70 or so behind on
my friends list.</p>

<p class=date>10:48am</p>

<p>Been reading LJs.  I'm 50 behind now.  Not including all the
comments I intend to read once I'm done going through the original
entries.  Oh, I'm reading the originals offline (I've just loaded five
windows worth of entries and have been reading them).  When I see some
comments I want to read, I copy that link to my bookmarks so I can
just go through all my bookmarks when I get online.</p>
