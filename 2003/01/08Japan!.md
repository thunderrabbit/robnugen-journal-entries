<p>OH my gosh</p>

<p>I just called Nova to see if, maybe I had given them the wrong
address, and it turns out they sent my job offer package to
Greenbriar!  I know fo sheezy that I didn't give that address, but
whatever; I gave them my current address and they'll send me another
offer sooon.  Should get it next week.</p>

<p>WHOOOOO!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Due to this delay, I have missed the February deadlines, so if I'm
speedy gonzales about getting the information back to them, I can go
as early as March.</p>

<p>They will send me my new address about 2 weeks before I leave.
fuckin' A I have time to make another month long trek across all of
February!  I could go see my peeps in West Virginia again; I'd really
like to do that.  And Hawaii doesn't sound half bad.  Wow
wowowowowowowow whoohooooo!!</p>
