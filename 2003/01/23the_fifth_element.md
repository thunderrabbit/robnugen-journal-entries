<p>Maggie and I watched <em>The Fifth Element</em> tonight.  Good
stuff.  At the end, I was all, "I love you!  I love you!" trying to
help save the world.</p>

<br>that is one of my favorite movies ever, but no one ever agrees with me. <br>
im sorry you lost your cell phone. what a hassle. i recently got a cell <br>
phone. it has already taken over my life. if i lost it, what would i do.<br>
im such a big kid now. actually, i left my cell phone at school on accident<br>
this weekend. im going crazy. i think maybe thats why im online. i havnt <br>
been in a long time. i didnt go back and read all your entries yet, cause <br>
im worried about getting to the rally entry. im sad i didnt go. also a reason among many, mostly that i just hanvt felt like it, that i havnt lj'd in a long time either. another funny thing, my house is in the middle of nowhere and the verizon service is really crappy out here, so i dont use the phone anyways while im at home cause it never works. and yet another funny thing, i have <br>
unlimited weekend minutes. sigh. the number, now that you have no phone with which to call me, or a chance of talking to me till monday anyways, or a desire to call my cell phone, cause thats a really weird sudden jump right, is 757 630 4347. hahahah. funny allovertheplace. i hope you can read this, but im sure you can. it seems we sometimes have a swell understanding between us, and even my endless comma sentances and dangling participles cant ruin that. right on buddy. until then. (when?) hah! ok ok, ill stop with the funny. <br>
au revoir.<br>
