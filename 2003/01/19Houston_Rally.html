<p class=date>12:35am CST Sunday 19 January 2003</p>

<p>Right now talent show.  Amy is playing harp.   I wonder, yeah
there's Fred; he wanted to hear her.</p>

<p>Just now Erica Nagel was playing piano and Joel was plinking the
highest note at various intervals, making for some simple and annoying
accompanyment.  Good job, Joel!</p>

<p>Then he played an ad lib composition, which sounded like it could
actually maybe be a song.. maybe a KTRU song, but yeah.  Funny.  Tyler
beat Joel off the piano bench with pillows.</p>

<p>I've really enjoyed watching Amy's harp skillz improve over the
years.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So, when I arrived, I parked, got my shiznit and walked toward
where I assumed the advisor sleeping area was (it's been there all the
past years rallies have been in this church)...  got lots of hugs and
I'm glad the names just came to my brain right on target.  hugs and
hugs to all the kittens who came up to me, "ROB!!!" in surprised happy
voices..  such a fantastic greeting.</p>

<p>Joel is sitting by me now while Steve prepares to play guitar.
"Rocky Raccoon?"  Nope, not yet.</p>

<p>Slowly made my way inside, and more hugs and chit-chat with anyone
who queried about Japan or how long I'll get to stay tonight or
whatever.  Fred started pushing me in toward the main room, where I
was all "eeeeek" in my mind, having no idea what these wonderful crazy
youth may have planned.</p>

<p>Mostly chaos in the room, reminding me somewhat of Houston 1999
<em>Fricke Fiesta Con Queso</em>, and more hugs, and slowly I was
moved to one side of the room where there was a big cake iced "YRUU
Loves Rob!" So fantastic.  Colleen got everyone's attention and was
all "This is Rob and it's his last rally cause he's going to Japan"
and all this stuff and I don't totally remember it cause I was just so
swallowed up with happy/wistful emotions completely filled with love
from and for all these beautiful youth and for six previous years of
youth, equally awesome and completely unique and all the same.</p>

<p>Colleen went on, "so we're going to play a game, called Pin Rob on
Japan, where you'll get a chance to pin little faces of Rob on this
big map!"  I was all "HAHAA!!!!" and Colleen knew at that point she
had succeeded in making my going away thing great.  Awesome!</p>

<p>M&Ms were the prize, because I love Eminem.  So awesome.</p>

<p>Then the best thing was I got to cut the cake!!  Wow!!  I've never
gotten such free artistic license in cake cutting before.  I cut a big
oval around the words and inside the flowered corners, then some
radial lines and a big figure 8 thing, well a sinewave that came back
on itself with opposite amplitude, then crazy lines all over the
place... man it was awesome!  Big pieces, little pieces crazy
shapes... everyone got the perfectly sized piece designed just for
them.  Beautiful.</p>

<p>Then more chatting and yammering and hugs and then the dance
contest, which had categories: Salsa, Techno, ROB, Hip Hop, Ethnic,
Mosh Pit, Disco, and others.  I signed up for the ROB style dancing
and though it was number 8 on the list, they did it first!  For that
one they played Eminem's "Lose Yourself," which gave me a good
challenge for doing Rob's Crazy Dance since it's a relatively slow
song.  But I apparently did well (or the contest was rigged) cause I
won.  Whooo!!</p>

<p>After Erica's mom Laura won the Disco competition, I got the idea
that it must be rigged.  ;-) I commented to Sally and Josephine "haha
adults have won both contests so far."</p>

<p>The Mosh Pit contest pulled in far more contestants than had
actually signed up.  The pit got pretty crazy, so I slipped daintily
out to the side, and Ben was all "haha good job, Rob" on that.  Just
<em>yoink</em> and I slipped out of the melee.</p>

<p>During the hip hop competition, Steve Feinstein did his russian
dance thing, the trotsky I think he called it.  According to Erica,
the winners tied, but Steve was the overall winner for his "Russian
Dance thingie!"</p>

<p>After the dance, the activities dispersed to more dancing, groovy
juice making, Love Feast preparation, worship preparation.  Ed gave me
some groovy juice, which was warm!  He (and Richard and/or Casey I
assume) came up with the brilliant idea of boiling the groovy juice,
which helps the sugar dissolve and boils off some of that pesky water
that would otherwise dillute it.</p>

<p>This time it included jello and chocolate and marshmallows.  Yummmm
eeee.</p>

<p>After giving Laura Caddell some groovy juice, I met her friend
Chris, or wait, Jaime's friend Chris from Austin, though Jamie is from
Bay Area, er, Northwest Community in Houston.</p>

<p>Then we moved over to the Schweitzer Room for the love feast where
Asha explained everything andtried to keep everyone quiet during the
process..  Did pretty well, considering how unquiet people were being
overall.  I stood with eyes closed and enjoyed having various people
feed me grapes, sliced oranges and grapefruit, whipped cream, and
cubed cheese.  Totally awesome sensations.</p>

<p>Then worship, which started with Kenny introducing his dad who gave
some details on equal rights movements, including reading MLKJr's "I
have a dream" speech.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Then we lit candles while Amy played harp.  Names of peace
activists in history were read, and people called out names of
places/organizations where we want peace.</p>

<p>Then outside near what I assume is the tree we planted at Houston
Rally a few years ago (amazing how no one remembers) (I wasn't
actually at the tree planting ceremony so I won't assume that is in
fact the tree) everyone froze, but stood and sang and lit candles
again.  When candles were all extinguished, Joel kept his lit.  Then
he held his way up in the air and goes, "haha suckers!" like we had
all fallen victim to the biggest candle extinguishing hoax in history.
Joel is so funny!</p>

<p>At talent show, Katy B-H sang a song for Stevie, and then sang the
"I'm a cow" song for her as well.  Quite cute and funny.</p>

<p>Stevie is now dressed in (what's it called when a woman dressed up
as a man?  man-drag?) and lip synching Right Said Fred's "I'm Too
Sexy" to much oohs and ahhs from the audience, especially in her
briefs!!!! oh my god.</p>

<p>I'm not watching.</p>

<p>Ah, she says, "I'm a drag king"</p>

<p>This is Stevie's last last rally.  "Last rally was supposedly my
last rally, but I'll give my shpeel again, cause half the people are
new here and haven't heard it."</p>

<p class=date>1:07am</p>

<p>Now Amelia is singing and guitaring a new song.</p>

<p>(Interesting how completely awake I am, and how different this
makes my experience by attending only the last half of a rally.  I'm
not tired at Talent Show at all, whereas I usually doze during talent
shows... That's one good thing about attending only the last half of a
rally!)</p>

<p>Talent show now features some cat playing "Dead Puppies."  Oh,
these are the Jahnny Deppers.  Tim is the advisor, and Brian is the
youth.</p>

<p class=date>1:37am</p>

<p>Now Erin Dweezel that Me is playing guitar.  So fantastic to see
her out of her shell after that time I first met her at Fort Worth
Rally some year ago.  She's really a leader in the community now and
it's just fantastic.</p>

<p>Now Ben and Erin are reading skit play thing.  About Big Brother
Media and such.</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAAAHAHAH!!!  Oh my god Ben was reading the thing and kinda
got stumbled on the words and then was all, "I'm tired of this" and
threw the paper down.  HAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHA!!!  "Erin Dunn everyone!"</p>

<p>Erica: "A for Affort"</p>

<p>Tanner: "F for Failure"</p>

<p>Calder: "B for Ben"</p>

<p>Ben is reading his ever-growing poem.  Awesome stuff.  Great
tradition.</p>

<p>Now Daveed is playing violin.  Some famous dead cat's composition
in A minor.  This is memorized; he forgot to bring his music.</p>

<p>Mmmmmmm.  Daveed gave me props in his pre speech before
playing. Kelly Denham and then me.  So thankful that I can be a
positive influence on so many lives.</p>

<p>Glen just played Danny Boy on harmonica.  I think his name is Glen.</p>

<p class=date>1:57am</p>

<p>Hunter is lip synching "Fly me to the Moon"</p>

<p>Scottie says, "he's so dreamy!"</p>

<p class=date>2:00am</p>

<p>Now Hanna is monologuing something that she hasn't practiced since
Thursday.</p>

<p>Laura says:</p>

<p class=message>hi rob  : )</p>

<p>Fred is reading a poem now. (*)</p>

<p>Awwwwwwwwww it featured me.  I love you all!!!</p>

<p class=date>2:08am</p>

<p>Now Hillary and Erica are playing a duet on piano.</p>

<p class=date>2:11am</p>

<p>Richard goes, "Rob, do you wanna play silent football on your last day?"</p>

<p>"Meh.  I don't really like that game anymore."</p>

<p>(*) This is the poem Fred wrote and read to us at talent show at my
last rally, Houston 2003.</p>

[Written during the talent show at Plano Rally 2002.]


What would YRUU be without all the hugs?
What if we had to say goodbye with just a handshake and a warm smile?
What would YRUU be without the late nights?
                   without the Talent Show?
                   without Silent Football?
                   without Ultimate frisbee?
                   without music?
                   without the Big 4?
                   without playing cards?
                           mugbooks?
                           Spoons?
                           Mafia?
What would YRUU be without "Bish"?
                   without "Yogi Bear"?
                   without the Three-Headed Question Monster?
                           evening worship?
                   without familiar faces?
                           friendly faces?
                   without forgetting people's names?
What would YRUU be without the Sunday Morning wake-up call?
                           movies?
                           smelly bodies?
                           the blissful sleep on the ride back?
                           the advisors to see us home safely?
                   without SWUUSI?

What will YRUU be without ROB?

Who will be Mr. Dictator?
Who will bring Wonderboy?
Who will play Ultimate without shoes?
Who will go to YAC meetings and keep the hell quiet
         (give or take an occasional snore)?
Who will we go to first with a sticky situation?

Enjoy the world, ROB.
Tell us what it's like out there.
Come back regularly and often.

We love you.
