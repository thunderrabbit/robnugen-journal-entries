<p>Maggie is so awesome.  She just called to let me know that though
we can't use a room at UH (they've been booked for a year for some
conference), we may find a great spot at Jillian's arcade
thingamajig.  Officially they kick out people under 21 at 10pm, but
she's going to do a bit more research on that to see thing like
<em>how</em> exactly do they kick people out, and who enforces the
kicking.</p>

<p>Then she told me a nutball story about a mutual aquaintence who is
hitting on Maggie in a rebound relationship crazy thing that Mags is
just like "no way Jose" about.  Man.. too weird.</p>
