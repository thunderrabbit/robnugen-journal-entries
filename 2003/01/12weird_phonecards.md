<p>Woah.</p>

<p>I just went to Kroger and saw a display sporting no fewer than six
(?) different communications companies, all with little prepaid cards
hanging from the display.  All the hanger things were the same size,
same shape, same <em>basic</em> look about them.  From companies AT&T
Wireless, Verizon, Cingular, something else, and some prepaid internet
company.  The internet company had some hangies that included a mini
CD with software and 60 "bonus" minutes, and some hangies that were
just recharge minutes with unique user/passwords.</p>

<p>So why not just scratch off the hidden username/password thing on
the card?  They have to be activated at the register.  Since when did
all these companies start talking?  Do they all have the same
activation process?  Kroger certainly wouldn't carry them unless they
made a pile of cash on each sale if they aren't super quick to
activate at the register.  So if it's a quick activation process, it
must be simple for the cashiers, and therefore I imagine not a
different process for each company, which means that somewhere, the
companies are all in bed together, or all talking to some common
distribution point or some shit like that.  So weird.</p>

<p>It's like a whole ton of companies (ton = six) are all teaming up
to make one big monopoly that officially isn't a monopoly.</p>
