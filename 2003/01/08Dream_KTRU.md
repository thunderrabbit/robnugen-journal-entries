<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Had just arrived at KTRU and Meg as in the station.  I
was the next DJ and I put on some music randomly as per my usual
custom, and then i realized I needed to read the MRA on, so I fumbled
around to find the headphones and the voume dial to keep from getting
feedback, and none of the controls are how I remember them, and I keep
getting feedback until I turrned the headphone volume all the way down
so I can't tell if anyone can hear me or not.  I begin to read the MRA
on from memory, and then I'm looking down at where the MRA on used to
be written and it's not there anymre.  It's a new thing that is not
waht I'm supposed to be reading, and I had to pull up that laminated
pece of paper to find the MRA On, all covered in sawdust and diffiuclt
to read; I pulled up the paper, and sawdust ad gotten all inside the
sealed thing so I had to hold it sidways to make ths awdust shake don
to one side so i could read it and then hold it the other way so I
could read th other half of it.  Just totally unprofessional and
crappy sounding, and I finally got through it and was so mad that I
had sounded like shit that I was going to complain to Will Robidee,
but I woke up first cause I was cold.

<p>Only had on a sheet for covers.  Now I have two quilts as well.</p>
