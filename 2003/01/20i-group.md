<p>Nice to reconnect with I-group tonight.  I wanted it to be all
about me, but Dennis, Robin, Tom all got to do some of their own
work.  I told them the stories behind the stories of the past six
months, those stories that I write but are not available on my
website.</p>

<p>Expressed my fear of going into the unknown of Japan, and my
conitnually expressed blessing that I live easily in the world.</p>

<p>Upon checkout, Tom expressed thanks to have me here in the circle,
and I immediately remembered YRUU and that Steve told me that I have
done some good in the community.  I cried recalling the story of the
cake YRUU loves Rob and Pin Rob on Japan.  So beautiful are the
memories.  Thank you, thank you.</p>

<p>I'm out.</p>
