<p>Doing pirouettes in the kitchen, I knocked a yardstick (that says
STITCH & BITCH on it, not like grafitti, but like that's what was
originally printed on the yardstick, in a creative font and
everything; weird) onto the floor.  Jack goes, "hey now, take it easy
there," as Jack is prone to do when things are subjected to sudden
bouts of entropy.</p>

<p>"That gravity..." I said, not having much more to say than that
until I remembered something interesting.  "You know something
interesting?"</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Scientists don't really know what gravity is."</p>

<p>[thoughtful pause] "I'm okay with that."</p>

<p>[thoughtful pause] "They don't even know how fast gravity waves
travel."</p>

<p>"Well, you know, they're fast enough."</p>

<p>Jack is hilarious.  Jack the Philosopher.</p>
