<p class=date>7:25am CST Friday 31 January 2003</p>

<p class=dream>I was in school, like a college situation, and it was
my last day to be there; I was leaving in the middle of the semester.
Super happy and nostalgic and went down to the cafeteria, sitting
between two girls I hadn't met before across from a friend of mine,
randomly yammering about what it will be like in my new life, and what
it will be like here when I'm gone.  Bryn was wandering around
randomly and didn't say bye to me though I'm pretty sure she knew I
was leaving.  Scotty was like, "this is it? your last day?" and gave
me a air high five across the room.</p>

<p class=dream>Fred got there as I was finishing up my bowl of
applesauce and dancing, mirroring some group of people dancing on the
other side of the table.  I felt happy enough to dance with applesauce
in the middle of the cafeteria and didn't care what anyone thought
cause today is my last day!</p>
