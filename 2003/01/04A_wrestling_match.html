<p>This morning Josephine bounded into bed, "look!  I'm awake before
you!" and Janette, Josephine and I had a tickle-fight-wrestling-match,
which was pretty darn fun until Josephine lost her biggest nail..
"Oh, that was your cocaine nail; I'm so sorry.."  Tanner helped her
clip it off cleanly.  Little bit ripped past the skin part.</p>

<p>Joel came to watch what all the commotion was about as Janette
played "push Rob off the bed" and I played "tickle Janette on the bed"
Joel chose not to join, but just to watch.</p>

<p>Janette's neighbor Barbara had called to say she had to go to work,
asked if Janette would go visit her house to make sure the roof
workers left with only their stuff.</p>
