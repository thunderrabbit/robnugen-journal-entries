<p>Jackie came over, brought Josephine from her dad's house.  Jack and
I had rented movies, so we watched <em>Death to Smoochy</em> at Joe's
recommendation.  We thought it was pretty good and cute and bizarre.
We all agreed that if we make a movie, we will have outtakes at the
end.  I was intrigued by the way the outtakes were also editted, not
just pasted together in one long string.</p>

<p>After the movie the girls trimmed Jack's hair.  Jackie considered
buzzing *some* of her hair, just a little trim off the top, but
decided against it.  "I'm tempted," she kept saying.</p>
