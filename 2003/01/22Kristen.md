<p class=date>4:55pm CST Thursday 23 January 2003</p>

<p>Hung out with Kristen after hanging out with Erika.  We visited
Whole Foods and chatted.  I invited Madison to my 12,000th day party.
Then we went to Ikea and then to her new apartment.  I was feeling
crummy-ish and didn't want to (a) stop playing with Kristen (b) tell
her I might be sick (cause I really think I'm not) (c) I don't know.
Fuck it just was crummy and I was wuss and agreed that I was bored
after she gave me the option.  It just felt really fucked up cause I
was all feeling poopy pants.</p>

<p>I'm sorry Kristen, that I wasn't more able to speak up and just go
home to sleep.</p>
