<p>I have my NOVA contract at my dad's house!</p>

<p>I never checked my cell phone messages until last night, the first
of which was my dad saying the Priority Mail package was here.</p>

<p>Part of me is bummed that my dad didn't try more thoroughly to
reach me, and part of me is bummed I wasn't checking my messages.  But
most of me is just excited and ready to move on.</p>

<p>I'm going through the documentation now to figure out what I need
to send them.</p>

<p>Once I send all my stuff in, they will send it off to Japan, and
once they've heard back from Japan, will let me know my departure date
and my new address and such.</p>

<p>Woah!</p>

<p>The sample Education and employment resume shows 03/25 as the month
and date!</p>

<p>Filled out everything I can so far for Nova.  Need to get Maggie's
zipcode, and get copies of my passport, and 6 new passport photos.  Oh
and I need to send them either a certified transcript, or my actual UH
diploma, that has been rolled up in a tube ever since I got it 8 years
ago.</p>

<p>I tried to look up Maggie's zipcode on my dad's computer, but it
Netscape kept fucking up and I used IE and it said it was out of
memory.  Aw man; I thought my dad was a computer kinda guy.  Seems
like he'd have a computer with enough memory to run a browser.</p>

<p>I'm gonna roll back to Houston and visit my old Kinko's to get
copies and passport photos and .. oh but first go by Maggie's and see
if she has my diploma rolled up.  I think I gave it to her.</p>

<p>And then play at Paint This! and then go to I-group.</p>
