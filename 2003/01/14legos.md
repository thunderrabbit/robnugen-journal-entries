<p>My big help with cleaning up Sean's room was picking through his
huge quantity of Legos, removing all non-Lego items.  About a quart of
non Lego stuff in three gallons worth of Legos.  Maybe only two
gallons.  Jack and Janette helped me get through the final bit of
sorting after dinner.  Then Janette vaccuumed the room; I lifted the
futon while she vaccuumed underneath it.</p>

<br>you are so strong.  it was so awesome how you just picked up the futon,and with one hand, if i'm not mistaken.<br>
everyday jobs are more like play and less onerous with your help.
