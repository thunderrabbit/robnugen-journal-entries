<p>It's been great being back home.  Janette made me chicken soup with
real chicken; I was all, "so that's what's been taking so long to heat
up a can of soup!  You're not heating up a can of soup!"  She made a
blackberry pie and I got to roll out the top crust and write BLACK
BERIES with a fork poking holes in the top and then realized I had
missed an R so I made an R with an arrow pointing to its place.</p>

<p>Joel, Kally (sp), Brent came by on their way to see <em>Bowling For
Columbine</em>.  They chatted a bit while Joel ate ice cream, pie,
chicken soup.</p>

<p>Earlier today I tried to set up an addressbook application on my
server so I can keep all my contacts on my webserver where the backups
will be maintained for me.  Basically so I can lose my computer and
not lose all my friends' phone numbers and such.  I manually exported
the info from my Palm Desktop app here and used emacs to format it
with | delimeters.  But when I moved the resulting file to my site, it
didn't seem to like it.  Treated the whole thing as one record.  Kudos
to Perl for not breaking on such a long string, but d'oh that I don't
know why it's not working the way I wanted..</p>

<p>Now Janette and I are going to watch <em>Monsoon Wedding</em> which
we've both heard is an excellent movie.</p>

<p>It was alright.  I'm glad the dad kicked that bad cat out to
protect the family.</p>
