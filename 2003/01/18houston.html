<p>Leaving Janette's now for Houston.  How amazing that the shortest
trip I've taken can feel like the longest of all.</p>

<p class=date>2:38pm</p>

<p>93 miles traveled.</p>

<p>This drive feels like it's taking forever.  Is it because I've seen
it all before?  If so, that violates my belief that suggests when a
long drive is made repetitively, that it seems to take a shorter time
after a while.  This could be described as "getting used to it," but I
think it's more precisely that the brain disengages and just goes on
auto pilot for the journey, making the time seem to pass more
quickly.</p>

<p>I've got Eminem blasting, and I'm just flat driving, which seems to
be just what I did on my driving treks.  Maybe this is different
because I have an agenda; I'm specifically driving to Houston, and am
not willing to stop anywhere along the way.  Then I'm all, "oh a stop
won't hurt" and then I'm all, "but at least get half way there."</p>

<p>And that's just the thing; I'm not even halfway there, but I'm
still all ugggg that this trip is already taking forever.</p>

<p class=date>4:49pm</p>

<p>Have basically made it to Maggie's.  At the halfway point (123
miles) I found some sunflower seeds in the magic box Janette had given
me so long ago.  Yay Janette!</p>
