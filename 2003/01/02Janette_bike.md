<p>Janette and i rode bikes around the cool part of the lake, down by
the spillway.  It was still spilling basically all the way across, but
not nearly the volume.  More like 1 inch with 3 inch waves sliding
across like a horizontal barber pole creating diagonal splashes
walking down the wall.</p>

<p>We rode through where the chain link fence had been knocked down,
carried our bikes across some rocks to the island on the downside of
the concrete spillway.</p>

<p>I think I could see on an adjacent island how high the water had
been; about three feet above the current water level, leaves were
covering the ground, as if they had fallen there from trees naturally,
not like they had been dropped off there by receding water.  The lower
parts of the island were basically clean except for a very few same
type of leaves.</p>
