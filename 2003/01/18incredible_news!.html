<p>Whooo hooo!!!  Guess what Maggie did?????</p>

<p>She got a call from Colleen who had called Janette and got Maggie's
number to tell me that I would be allowed to stay through closing
circle!!</p>

<p>Colleenie Beanie, you're my hero!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Ohhhhhh so much better.</p>

<p>Thank you thank you to everyone who helped fix this.  You're the
best!!</p>

<p class=date>7:45pm</p>

<p>Great dinner with Maggie, Molly, Kerry, Billy, David, Daniel, &
Alfred at Ugo's.  Billy is apparently a reporter (with bad spelling),
and asked us questions in the form, "what do you guys think about
________ ?" and filled in the blank with light rail, revitalizing
downtown Houston, cameras at intersections, etc.</p>

<p>On the way there Molly rode with me and told me Anna stories,
including how she has teeth and likes to bite people and the dog, who
is good natured about it.  So awesome.</p>

<p>This is all so short because I'm at the church, and very excited.</p>

<br>I'm going to miss you Rob. Although better things lay ahead for you in Japan. I'm glad you came to see us all
    for your last rally. Thanks for the hugs. Thanks for helping Erin through her time of need when I couldn't be there.
    You mean a lot to everybody in YRUU, and out. You're one of those special people who everyone connects with on an
    awesome level. I hope I can be like that someday. I hope you can come back sometime in the future to visit rallies
    or SWUUSI. That would be awesomely rad! All I wanted to say is, thanks. Thanks for everything. You are truely a
    totally rad guy.<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
