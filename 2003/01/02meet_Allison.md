<p>Allison, Sean's ex girlfriend happened to be at the house when we
all made it back.  She seems like quite an outgoing person, living
fully happily in New York (Janette says she (Allison) saw the WTC get
fucked up in 2001), going to school at some artsy school.</p>

<p>This summer she'll visit her brother in the Ukraine, and get to do
something (go to Lucca) in Italy and then work in Italy as a
photographer for her friend.</p>

<p>I didn't really talk to her as she was hanging out, but she left to
see her boyfriend (a performer in the band Polyphonic Spree (is that
the one that someone and someone else drove like a really long way
just to see?  I don't remember, but it sounds close (I don't think it
is)) which is apparently performing tonight) I was all, "you have good
energy," and "I'm glad you're going to do cool things this
summer."</p>
