<p>After errands, Janette and I have been listening and reading aloud
respectively <em>Stranger in a Strange Land</em>.  40 pages worth this
evening.  She has been preparing spinach quiche and chocolate chip
cookies and ranch dressing and salad.  Yummmm eeeee.</p>

<p>She's got to leave at 5am for Boise Idaho for a few days.  She and
Charity are installing decoration for another restaurant.</p>
