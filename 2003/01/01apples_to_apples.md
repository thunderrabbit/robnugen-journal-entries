<p>Just played Apples to Apples with several cats like Laura, Tyler,
Jack, Natalie, Casey, Sally, Richard, Amelia, me.  I learned that Mark
Twain is a good trump card for Jack.  I almost played it once on him
before I knew he'd probably go for it.</p>

<p>However, for most of the game, I had a bunch of stupid People
Cards, which don't usually do well in the game.  The game ended as I
started to get some good trump cards like The Universe, and something
else.</p>
