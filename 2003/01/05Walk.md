<p class=date>6:12pm CST Sunday 5 January 2003</p>

<p>This morning Sally and I went for a walk to the lake and I
discovered they had built new playground equipment on the top of the
hill where previously there had been only two teeter totters and
swings and maybe a something to climb on.  The equipment is almost all
new now, with some toys I hadn't previously seen.</p>

<p>One is a bar with two lightbulb shapes hanging upside down.
Handles on the lightbulbs allow people to hang from them, and there's
a spring in them allowing some bouncing action.  Not too exciting, but
unique.</p>

<p>Then they have a handle thing on wheels that one can hang and roll
to the other side of the track (about 6 feet) but each end has a
pneumatic thing to make it slow down vaguely more smoothly than just
<em>kang</em> into metal or <em>bonk</em> into a rubber bumper.</p>

<p>Walked along the slanted wall and saw the spillway (still spilling
but rather shallow compared to some nights ago), then back toward
home.</p>

<p>Oh, I am surprised that I hadn't noticed until today that one of
the jogging trails is built where railroad tracks used to be.  It's so
obvious that I'm surprised I didn't notice before.</p>
