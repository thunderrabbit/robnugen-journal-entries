<p>Kate Robinson is here at the Bibby's house; she's been here plenty
of times before.  Not like a million times, but like a hundred times.
Maybe ten.  Anyway, she's never answered the phone here before
tonight.</p>

<p>Char, a friend of mine who I invited to my 12000th day party
tomorrow, called to say she cannot attend.</p>

<p>Kate knows Char through church.  So, for the first time that Char
has ever called here, and the first time that Kate has ever answered
the phone here, it was the same time.  Kate was all, "it's Char!" in a
surprised whisper.  How amazing is the universe.</p>
