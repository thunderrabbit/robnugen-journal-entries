<p class=date>4:13am CST Friday 24 January 2003</p>

<p>Ug.</p>

<p>I have a headache to beat all headaches and snotty nose to beat all
snotty noses.  Actually it's more clogged up than snotty.  Just ug.
All snot is clear, so I don't think I'm sick, I just feel like shit though.</p>

<p class=date>4:20am</p>

<p>Just gargled some super salty warm saltwater.  Back to bed.</p>

<p class=date>9:12am</p>

<p>Awake now.</p>

<p>Around 6am, I got up to pee and I started to feel weird and
realized I was about to pass out.  Passing out while peeing could be
messy, so I forced/willed myself to not pass out, at least not all the
way.  It was close.  Finished peeing, carefully lowered my body to
fetal position on the floor, with my head down.  Most weirdest
uncomfortable nauseating feeling washed over me, and then went away.
I could feel sweat had gushed out my forehead.  Relaxed; waited for
everything to feel normal again.  Turned onto my back, and propped my
feet up on the wall, encouraging blood to visit my brain more than my
legs.  I could hear Maggie turning on her shower through the wall.</p>

<p>Once I felt stable, I got up, went back to bed.</p>

<p>Dad called around 7:30 or 8 to confirm that he chose not to see
Fred and I this weekend; Dad's schedule is all packed and such.  I
told him I already understood yesterday that he wouldn't be able to
see us.  He said that yesterday he was tentatively, but now he's
confirmedly too busy.</p>
