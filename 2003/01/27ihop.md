<p class=date>10:44pm CST Monday 27 January 2003</p>

<p>Kate, Josephine, me, Heather, Jack are all at IHOP now.  Heather
declared hungriness when she arrived; Jack and Kate had eaten.  I had
snacked.  I don't know about Josephine.</p>

<p>Joel called Kate's cellphone.  Joel said he would eat Jack's
boogers if Jack let Joel come over tonight.</p>

<p>Jack: "Jack will take care of his little Joel.  End of story."</p>

<p class=date>11:56pm</p>

<p>We're home now.  Kate is on the phone with Matt (I think);
Josephine is asleep (I think); Heather and Jack are discussing a paper
she needs to finish by tomorrow (I think).  Joel has just arrived (I
am certain).</p>
