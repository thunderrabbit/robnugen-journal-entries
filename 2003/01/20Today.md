<p class=date>4:10pm CST Monday 20 January 2003</p>

<p>Went to my dad's house, climbed through all the mail I've received,
especially the packet from Nova.  Filled out most of the forms, and
just need to get six passport photos and send everything off.</p>

<p>Found my diploma at Maggie's in the most easily accessible box of
those that she's holding for me.</p>

<p>At Kinko's now and cute Samantha was all, "may I help you?" and
stuff and she clicked my picture for passport photos, but no film.
She put the camera down, turned to get film and her leg caught the
power cord.  Shoop!  To the floor the camera cracked open.</p>

<p>"Shit!" she whispered forcefully..</p>

<p>I'll roll over to Kinko's in Rice Village and try again.</p>

<p class=date>5:30pm</p>

<p>I'm at the lodge now, an hour early for I-group.  I sent an email
last night telling my group I'd be here at this time in case any of
them wanted to come early and chat.  Maybe with some more timely
communication, they would have had time to plan for such.  We'll see
what happens.</p>

<p>The lodge is locked; maybe the guy who works here took the day off
to honor Martin Luther King Jr.</p>

<p>I went by Paint This! after getting 6 passport photos taken at
Kinko's nearby.  Jennifer said that someone had come by and said I was
going to be here.  Jennifer got the impression that I was apparently
supposed to be there from 11am to 4pm.  False.  Well, that's not what
I intended.  Anyway, hi Tina!</p>
