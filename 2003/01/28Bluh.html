<p>How can I feel so far behind on stuff *and* feel like I don't
really have to do anything *and* be on vacation all at once?</p>

<p>By not planning my day, filling it with good stuff that I think is
important, and just getting bogged in replying to countless emails,
each of which I treasure, but don't seem to have the energy or
enthusiasm to reply to 'em all.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to make a list and see what happens from there.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Argh.  My brain is imploding in a downward spiral.  Watch this:</p>

<p>Gotta work on my things to do list</p>

<p>Open up my existing list</p>

<p>Resist doing things on the list</p>

<p>Gotta prioritize things and maybe add things to the list</p>

<p>Oh jeez this isn't working, look up, see dishes; I oughta do the dishes.</p>

<p>Man fuck that I just want to go to sleep.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I can do this.  Cointoss: heads = stay awake/
tails = sleep: heads.</p>

<p>cointoss: heads = inside; tails = outside:  heads.</p>

<p>cointoss: heads = on computer; tails = not on computer:  heads.</p>

<p>cointoss: heads = write; tails = read.  tails</p>

<p>cointoss: heads = stuff directed at me; tails = stuff directed at
the world = tails.</p>

<p>cointoss: heads = LJ; tails = google: heads.</p>

<p>cointoss: heads = comments to old entries; tails = new entries
online. heads</p>

<p>cointoss: heads = am I on the right track?  tails = no.  tails.</p>

<p>Dammit.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>spiralling in my brain.</p>
