<p class=date>12:34am CST Wednesday 29 January 2003</p>

<p>Went to IHOP with Joel, Kate, Josephine tonight.  Mostly Joel and I
said "Alright" like Mitch Hedberg.</p>

<p>The waitress gave me Josephine's whipped cream from her hot
chocolate.  She was not willing to make a face different than a happy
face for Joel's Smiley Face pancake.  But she did give him the less
expensive adult Smiley Face pancake instead of children's version.</p>

<p>We switched tables while Kate was in the restroom, but she didn't
notice.</p>

<p>Tina called Kate's cellphone and I answered it, claiming it was my
cellphone, then gave it to Joel, who talked a bit, then gave it to
Josephine who did not get to talk because Tina had hung up.  Then Tina
wouldn't answer her phone when Kate tried to call her back.  I hope
Tina is okay.</p>

<p>I climbed into the back hatch of the van, over all the seats to the
driver's seat to drive home.</p>
