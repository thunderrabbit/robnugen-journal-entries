<p class=date>8:50am CST Tuesday 21 January 2003</p>

<p>Went to Kinko's, got the copies I needed of my passport and printed
out my resume.  Now I'm at a postal place to ship off my stuff to Nova
with overnight delivery.  Zooooom!</p>

<p>Been listening to Sam Malone on 104 KRBE.  Might call in tomorrow
early and tell him I've been on a road trip and going to Japan and see
if I can get a hookup on some good stuff.  SEEya!</p>

<p>Whoooohooooo!!</p>

<p>I have just sent off my documents to Nova with overnight delivery
to arrive by 10am tomorrow.  FedEX tracking number <a

so I can watch it zoom over.</p>

<p>I asked the cat if they had an option to get it there today.  They
used to before World Trade Center got hit.  It was called Sonic
Delivery.  For only a few or several hundred dollars, Whooooosh!</p>
