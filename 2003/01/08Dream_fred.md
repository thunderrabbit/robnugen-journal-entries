<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a shopping mall in France with Fred.  I had walked
away from him and came back to find him haning money to a fat guy who
grabbed it without trying to look conspicuous, except that he had to
reach over to get it.  I asked Fred what was the dealio and he was
all, "dammit $100 for nothing'" as he had apparently been looking at
some new shoes and shit fat cat had told him that he could get Fred
the soes for $100 instead of the price indicated.</p>

<p class=dream>A few minutes later Fred was approached by a cop who
tied his hands behind his back and tied his feet together, and dragged
him, still standing, back to his police office in the mall.  I was
all, "hey that's my brother, where are you going?" etc etc, but the
cop cat wouldn't answer my questions.</p>

<p class=dream>Once we got to the station, he wouldn't even tell me
where I could call to find Fred, nor even if he would stay in the
city, or the country.  (I resisted asking if he would stay in the
world)</p>

<p class=dream>A woman came up to me all, "he probably will," but I
didn't know if she meant he will stay, or he will go, or what.</p>
