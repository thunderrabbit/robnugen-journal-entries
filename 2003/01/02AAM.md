<p class=date>5:00am CST Thursday 01/02/03</p>

<p>I've been asleep for a while and woke up when the kittens' loud
game of Apples to Apples broke up.  I took an Eminem Quiz (did rather
poorly I think) and got about 5 of 15 right.</p>

<p>Oh, and I emailed Micaela back and my email bounced because someone
on my mail server has been sending spam to AOL users so our server has
been banned from AOL.  Pooey.  I wrote to my sysadmin to get the shit
fixed.</p>

<p>Read LJs and found it interesting that Ryan has determined that we
live in order to experience our feelings for a completely different
reason than I have determined the same thing.</p>

<p>I've written my reason before, but I'm too tired to look for it
now.</p>
