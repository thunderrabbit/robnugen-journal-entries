<p>I'm in Austin now, helping Janette rearrange her space in the
Uncommon Objects antique shop on Congress Street, I think.</p>

<p>We've been here for a while; I've carried some heavy stuff and
helped her hang and unhang things.  Now she is moving a bunch of
little stuff around, consolidating two different spaces that she had
into one, so she doesn't have to pay an extra $ per month for the
other space.</p>
