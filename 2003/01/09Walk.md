<p>Okay, it's absolutely beautiful outside.  I'm going for a walk.  I
invited/encouraged/begged Jack to go, but ... a body at rest tends to
stay at rest.</p>

<p>Walk was nice.  Clear sky.  Sun.  Breeze made it a bit cool, but
definitely workable with barefeet and shorts.  I talked to the guys
working near the manhole that had been spewing unlimited gallons of
clear water on the ground when Sally and I went for a walk.  Turns out
the water was spewing to empty out the pipe (84 inches diameter by 5
miles = a lot of gallons) so they could test it for fractures and
such, which they do every 6 or 8 years.</p>
