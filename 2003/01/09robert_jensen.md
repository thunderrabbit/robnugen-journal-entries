<p class=date>6:41pm CST Thursday 9 January 2003</p>

<p>Just got a call from Johnny, who invited Jack and I to dinner to
see Robert Jensen, a really cool journalism professor from UT.</p>

<p>Jack is pretty pumped.  I hope he talks to him after the talk.</p>

<p class=date>9:19pm</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>He suggested that another important thing we can be doing, besides
going to city council meetings, and going to rallies, and writing
letters, is just talking to people out in the world, especially those
who are in the 1/3 of the population that has a sense the war is
wrong, but can't really articulate why.</p>

<p>Two things to talk about:  short term - no war in Iraq.  That we
are being fed lines about fear of nuclear arms, and liberating Iraqis
and anti-terrorism.  But actually it's all just so we can control the
flow of the oil, and control the flow of profits from that oil.</p>

<p>And long term - no US Empire.  Has there ever been a benevolent
empire?  Absolute power corrupts; are we immune to this tenet?  Due to
the nature of our military, our taking over the world may be the end
of it.  Why are we the only nation pro militarization of outer space?</p>

<p>Afterward, Jack went up to inquire about the cost of Robert's
book.  "How much is the book?"</p>

<p>"Twenty dollars."</p>

<p>Instantly, Johnny Wolf slapped twenty dollars on the table and
handed Jack the book.  Johnny Wolf rules.</p>
