<p>Allison came by today looking for Sean.  She chatted with Jack and
I for a bit.  Said she broke up with her boyfriend, and that she is
rather excited to be back in New York soon, her first time to be there
and be single all at once.</p>

<p>Her hairdye color is Manic Panic's Deadly Nightshade, I think.
Wow; what a name.</p>

<p>Chatted with Ryan, Jackie, and Annie some online.  Asked them if they
could think of any more Silent Football names that people kept
consistent over several games.</p>

<p>Finished the bulk of rules to <a href="/sf/">Silent
Football</a>.</p>
