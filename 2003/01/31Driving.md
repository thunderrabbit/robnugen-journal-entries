<p class=date>9:22am CST Friday 31 January 2003</p>

<p>Before going to Houston I'll take Jack by the movie rental place to
hook a brotha up with a movie for him to watch while everyone else is
gone.</p>

<p class=date>10:32am</p>

<p>Okay.  I've showered, vaguely packed, remained calm.  Happy thoughts.</p>

<p class=date>10:46am</p>

<p>Jack made me a vegan sandwich for the road!  So awesome.  *And*
gave me chips *and* a coveted orange Sunkist.  MMmmmmmm</p>

<p class=date>11:34am</p>

<p>I just remembered that I forgot the two tiins of cookies Janette
gave me to take to the party.  D'oh!  but it's cool; we'll just have
more cookies to enjoy at home.  38 miles traveled so far.</p>

<p class=date>12:05pm</p>

<p>72.1 miles traveled.  I'm trying a new technique to make the trek
to Houston feel shorter: I'm stopping somewhat frequently.  I'm at a
rest area now, and will visit the next one in 91 miles.</p>

<p class=date>12:10pm</p>

<p>Driving again.</p>

<p class=date>1:26pm</p>

<p>OOps.  I just passed the next rest area.  I saw the sign for it and
then started engaging my brain again and realized I forgot my
mouthguard.  That thought process sucked up enough braincells to make
me forget all about the rest area.  168 miles driven now.  I'll stop
in Huntsville or so.</p>

<p class=date>1:32pm</p>

<p>Oops.  I missed the exit in Huntsville that I intended to take.
Okay, here's another.  If I can keep this thought in my mind for 2
more seconds.</p>

<p>Did it.  Whew.</p>

<p>175.55 miles driven.</p>

<p class=date>1:40pm</p>

<p>They didn't have Reese's Pieces!  I don't know what's up with
that.</p>

<p class=date>2:24pm</p>

<p>Freeway is blocked with a bit of construction.  From what I can see
there's a cat helping to guide a rather large frame thing that will
eventually be used to hold an exit sign or something.</p>

<p>223.2 miles traveled.</p>

<p class=date>2:53pm</p>

<p>Have just arrived at Maggie's work.  249 miles traveled, not
counting the 3 or so erased when I reset the odometer a bit after I
left, synchronizing it with 156000 miles on Scott.</p>
