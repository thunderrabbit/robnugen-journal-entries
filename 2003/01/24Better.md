<p>Feeling physically much better now.  Also I got a great email from
Ben Horne, a cool ex-DJ at Rice who is now in Kryzgstan or some
country, the name of which I've never previously heard.</p>

<p>Also got a phone number for Ricky Shaw! He's the ex-manager of Shaw
Chevron, excellent cheerleader for me for all my college years at
UH.</p>
