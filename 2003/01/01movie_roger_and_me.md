<p>Just watched <em>Roger and Me</em>, Michael Moore's first
documentary, the one where he hadn't yet made business cards, and was
unable to speak to the spokesperson of a plant on its last day of
operation.</p>

<p>I'm impressed with his tenacity in dealing with people.</p>

<p>I'm glad that Flint spent millions of dollars attempting to bring
in tourists before resorting to building a prison to keep up with all
the crime resulting from the lack of employement.</p>
