<p>We ate spaghetti dinner late.  Tanner and Joel sang in barber shop
quartet style this song:</p>

<pre>
(something about spaghetti dinner)
</pre>

<p>Quite cute and quite bad; they must have gotten stage fright cause
they sounded great while practicing in Josephine's room.</p>

<p>"Wow!  It's after midnight" seemed to be the general exclamation
after dinner.</p>
