Subject: no war

HI

I'm Rob Nugen, from the great state of Texas.  Please don't go to war
in Iraq.  We all know it's a war over oil.  Nothing to do with the
"threat" Iraq poses or any of the other cock-eyed reasons the media
has been feeding us.

If we go to war, I swear I'm leaving the country.  Actually I already
am leaving because I don't think we'll *not* go to war.  I'm going to
Japan.  I hope the US doesn't get the snot whipped out of it while I'm
gone.  I'd like to come back sometime.

Sooo, to keep us less likely to be attacked, let's play nice, and
*believe* that the UN can do their job and that they would really let
us know if Iraq had weapons.  These UN cats know what they're doing.
They know what a biological warhead looks like.  They'll let us know.
It will be okay.  So let's just calm everyone down and relax and have
a nice cup of tea while we *negotiate* with Iraq the way we are with
Korea.

Speaking of Korea, why are we negotiating with them while they have
admitted they have nuclear weapons?

Oh, because they have no oil.  That makes sense now.

It's not fair or admirable that we are being a big world bully just
because we can.  We are breaking UN laws just because no one is big
enough to tell us not to.

Did you have bullies beat you up when you were little?  I did.  It
wasn't nice.  I'd prefer not to be a bully in the world.  The thing
about being a bully is that sometime, somewhere, another bully will be
bigger.  It might take a while, but why encourage it?  Why not be nice
and have everyone like us and respect us?

And jeez louise don't say that "they" don't like us because we have
'freedom' or that "they" hate capitalism.  They hate us because we
bomb their wedding parties and hosptials and use tanks to mercilessly
kill and bury troops who are TRYING TO SURRENDER!

Anyway, have a nice day, keep cool, no war, encourage peace through
negotiation, no violence, etc etc.

	Thanks
	- Rob
