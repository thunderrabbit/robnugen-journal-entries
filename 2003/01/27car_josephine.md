<p>Josephine and I went to the park where she could drive.  She did
much better at not killing the car and not scratching the tires when
accelerating.  Super awesome progress.</p>

<p>She got bored of driving on a figure 6 parking lot.  "Sixy Mc Six
Six"  "I'm to Sixxy for your car."  "Hey, why don't you just go,
phoney.  I was referring to him being on the phone."</p>

<p>Oh, so she got bored driving in circles so I drove in search of
another good place to drive.  I think we found a good neighborhood
though it has steep hills (but very limited traffic) (where her dad
Rick used to live from 4th to 9th grade or something).  We were both
tired though and came home.  Watched a bit of Simpsons and now we're
with Amanda to watch <em>Chicago</em> at the theater.</p>
