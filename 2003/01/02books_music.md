<p class=date>10:59pm CST Thursday 2 January 2003</p>

<p>Went to CD Source, which I must admit has a great selection.  Lots
of variety.  Lots of bands I'd never heard of.  I asked for some
jungle, but none of them knew of any artists that would be good for
that kind of thing.  The jungle expert was gone for the day.</p>

<p>I found Tori Amos stack and bought a single for $1.99 that includes
a live version of "Winter."  Listened to Amelia's CD on the way home
and ended up stopping at the bookstore.  I was joking at first but
they were really set on going once the idea had formulated.</p>

<p>I looked for <em>Angry Blonde</em> the Eminem story, which the
computers thought they had in stock twice.  But I couldn't find it,
and the sales person couldn't either.  Ah well.  I did find a Nine
Inch Nails biography and Marilyn Manson biography, but didn't get
either of them.  Had forgotten my wallet.</p>

<p>(oh, thanks to Janette and Josephine for spotting me $1.99 + tax at
the CD store, but then I found $2.25 in my pockets at the bookstore to
repay them)</p>
