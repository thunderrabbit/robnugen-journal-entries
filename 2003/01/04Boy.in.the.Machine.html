<p>I just spent some time chatting with Ryan, giving him some input on
how he can better his <a
href="https://boyinthemachine.tripod.com">comic site, Boy In The
Machine</a>, which is quite bizarre and quite funny for those who like
bizarre, or who like to read a good rant or two about religion or
life.</p>

<p>I'm super glad that I can support him in his quest for magnificence
in web presence, so he can go to his mailbox and shout, "I'm a dim dam
genius!" and money will appear.</p>
