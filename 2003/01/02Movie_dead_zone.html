<p>Janette and I are watching The Dead Zone now.</p>

<p class=date>7:56pm</p>

<p>It was cute.  "Like an HBO movie," says Janette.</p>

<p>"Like a kids' after school special."</p>

<p>Hahahaah</p>

<p>Best part was at the very end, after the closing credits, the name
PILLAR with the first L backwards, had the two L's alternately

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Pause, "you're grounded."</p>
