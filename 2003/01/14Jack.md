<p>Jack relayed the story of his adventures to Beaumont and Houston
today before our bike ride.  When we got back from our ride, he was a
bit bummed for he had learned that one of his friends was in trouble
for having visited with Jack after curfew at The Academy.  Jack
believes this cat won't be kicked out, but has concerns that maybe
Aisha's continued attendance will be adversely affected.</p>

<p>I trust that everything will work out for the best.</p>
