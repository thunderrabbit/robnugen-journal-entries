<p>Josephine helped me with dishes by drying those that I washed and
rinsed.  I'm thankful for her help.  I asked Janette not to help,
which she found difficult.  As difficult as getting Joey to help,
maybe..</p>

<p>I'm really thankful for the space that Janette has created here,
allowing everyone to hang out in a safe, fun, loving environment.  I'm
specifically thankful that she allows me to just be here in this
space, paying only by doing odd jobs around the house.  Such a
wonderful vacation from work that I'm having!</p>

<p>Part of me is falling in love with her, but I dare not write that
here!</p>

<p>Also, the screen on my laptop seems to be flaking.  All the pixels
are fine, but the backlight sometimes doesn't.</p>
