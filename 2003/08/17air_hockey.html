<p>Had fun tonight at the FAKNAT First Annual Kawasaki Nova Air-hockey
Tournament, most of which was spent at Warawara drinking (orange
juice) and eating random food items.  The whole night cost me 2000
yen, and everyone else between 3000 and 4000 yen.  Alcohol is
expensive.</p>

<p>Mike sat beside Rumi quite overtly flirting with her, which I
certainly understand, but I'm not as impressed with his motives, which
are, dare I snoot, worse than mine ever were.  "But what do I do with
them after I fuck them?" has been attributed to him.</p>

<p>Okay, enough of that.</p>

<p>I was in the first group who went to the air hockey fields.  Benny
whupped Olivia, then I beat Carla, which kinda surprised me, but then
I beat Benny, which quite surprised me (I had him 8-5 then he had me
9-8 then I won 10-9)</p>

<p>So I emerged the winner over the Northern Division (an arbitrary
designation to 6 of 24 names listed), but then . oh wait.. um, well I
played Ali and he barely beat me, but the game was out of order; he
was in a different division; I had to play Jen first, which I did (and
won), and then played Ali again, and this time he soundly whupped me,
or rather I scored several points on myself.</p>

<p>Lyle emerged as the winner of the Western Division, and the Eastern
Division winner dropped out after winning, so the final was between
Ali and Lyle, but Lyle had to "take care of some business" (Ali said
"do what you gotta do to sleep at night, mon") and never came back
during the night.</p>

<p>Back at the bar, I took lots of pictures, some of which I'll
post.</p>

<p>Found out that Carla knows ASL!!!  Wow!  So we signed a tiny bit
(what's yer name, and "have to be home before 10pm" (referring to
Detroit (which Benny pronounces as "de-troy-it"), not to ourselves)
and stuff like that) which was pretty awesome.  She got a degree in
ASL 7 years ago, and hasn't used it much since then.</p>

<p>I waited for Jen, Olivia, and Olivia to be done so we could all go
home together, but while in the underground mall, Olivia picked up a
small pile of cardboard flyer things and tossed them into the air.
Eeek.  That was too much for me; I left them.  Olivia texted me "we
lost you in the crowd; where are you?"  and I told her I was not
impressed with her antics and I left because I was embarassed to be
seen with them.</p>

<p>Then she replies</p>
