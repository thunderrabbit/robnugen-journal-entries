<p>We got earthquaked today!  It pretty much rocked.  I could actually
feel a relatively high frequency vibration (like 20 hz) for a moment
before the quake hit full on.   I've felt such vibrations before and
dismissed them since there was no apparent earthquake.  From now on
I'll more likely believe they <em>are</em> the earthquake!</p>

<p>The big part of the quake lasted like 5 seconds plus residual
building rocking.  Pretty fun overall.</p>

<br>Hey, Rob.  I can imagine you riding the earthquake like a cowboy riding a bronco :).  Okay, so I've been in Texas too long, forgive me.  Little hard to follow all the office conflict, but I've got a general idea.  I've got similar stuff, but I suppose most people do.  Hope all is well.<br>
