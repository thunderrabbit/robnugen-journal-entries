<p>Work was aight today.</p>

<p>Yukiji and Satoko were both in the voice room when I had voice.
They yammered, both probably unaware that I've hung out with both of
them outside of Nova.  Hung out with is the key phrase; they both know
I have a girlfriend.</p>

<p>Satoko is the going to Cali; she's the one Sally foffered to say HI
to once Satoko is settled.</p>

<p>After voice, I had Yoshie man to man.  Now she has my address.  (I
told her I have a girlfriend.) She likes rollercoasters, and one day
rode Fujiyama 9 (nine) times in a row.  Sweet.</p>

<p>Sweet.</p>

<p>Now I'm on my way home to change clothes before going back for the
great First Annual Air Hockey Championship of Nova Kawasaki.</p>
