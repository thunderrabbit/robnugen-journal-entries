<p>During the last lesson, we suddenly heard all the ceiling tiles
just.. creak a bit as they shifted.  Senses alerted.  Then felt the
gentle shake.</p>

<p>"Earthquake!"  smiles.  Cool.</p>

<p>I stood up to better experience any aftershocks.  There were none.</p>

<p>- - as written on bbst: - -</p>

During a lesson, we heard all the ceiling tiles creak...  it was like
the sound scurried by over our heads from one end of the room to the
other.

*Then* we felt the floor do a quick side to side.  And that was it.   

Cheers or general exclamations could suddenly be heard through the
ceiling, like their sports team had just scored an impressive point.

<p>After the lesson, I saw Benny and was all, "how was that?"
referring to the earthquake.</p>

<p>"Same as always, I take them to the back room and have sex."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was you?"</p>

<p>"What was me?"</p>

<p>"Dude.  There was an earthquake; didn't you feel it?"</p>

<p>"No; I told you we were having sex.  Dammit, I missed an
earthquake?  I always miss them!"</p>

<p>As we were leaving, "Sumika, did you feel the earthquake?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Awesome."</p>

<p>"Scary."</p>

<p>"Was it a big one?"</p>

<p>"Maybe a big one."</p>

<p>Those Japanese like the word 'maybe.'</p>

<p>Chie, Benny's student, was downstairs texting someone when we
emerged from the building.  Benny prodded her in the shoulder with his
elbow. (she's short)</p>

<p>"Chie, did you feel the earthquake during your lesson with
Benny?"</p>

<p>"My lesson was fun."</p>

<p>"No, there was an earthquake; did you feel it?"</p>

<p>(rabbit in headlights)</p>

<p>"You know," Benny shook his hands "e a r t h q u a k e,"</p>

<p>I punched the word into my translator.</p>

<p>"Honto?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, did you feel it?"</p>

<p>"No I don't feel earthquake."</p>

<p>"Ah okay.  Well there was one.  See you later!"</p>

<p>Did she mean "didn't" or "earthquakes" ?</p>

Temblor jolts Ibaraki Prefecture

An earthquake registering a magnitude of 5 hit Ibaraki Prefecture on
Monday evening and was felt in Tokyo, the Meteorological Agency said.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage from the 8:57

The temblor measured 4 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 7

the agency.

Its focus was some 50 km underground in northern Ibaraki, the agency
