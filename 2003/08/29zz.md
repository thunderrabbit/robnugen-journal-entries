<p class=date>12:27am JST Saturday 30 August 2003</p>

<p>More than anything (*), I want to play around online and visit BBST
and work on my website and organize pictures and write emails and read
livejournal.</p>

<p>But instead, I'm going to bed.</p>

<p>(*) except waking up easily and refreshed for work tomorrow</p>

<p class=date>1:57am</p>

<p>(**) except except making flashcards and watching an hour of
_Bowling For Columbine_</p>
