<p class=date>12:44pm JST Friday 8 August 2003</p>

<p>Called Susiemom to wish her happy birthday after I saw her LJ
entry.  I'm a tad later for work than I intended; missed the previous
bus by a couple minutes; I trust this bus will get me to work on
time.</p>

<p>Yeeha; he's runnin' red lights.</p>

<p class=date>1:01pm</p>

<p>350 meters to Kawasaki station.  But there are lights.  I think
we'll make it.</p>

<p>(I made it)</p>
