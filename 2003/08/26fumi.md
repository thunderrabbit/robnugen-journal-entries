<p>Tonight Fumi took me to a building I had never heard of, but that
turns out I had wanted to visit since the second day I was in Japan.
This is the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office or something like
that; a single building with two 55 story towers, each with a viewing
area on the 45th floor or so.  We took some time to scope the view
from each direction, and on the 7th of 8 windows I noticed... "wait a
minute!  That's the NOVA sign that I used as a landmark when I first
got here.  Oh yeah, it was Shinjuku station.. and that's where my
hotel was, and *that* must be the Nova main office... which makes
*these* the buildings I saw and wanted to explore!"</p>

<p>Tight.</p>

<p>So we went to that building and scoped the Huge Clock, and then
zipped over to Shinjuku station and I found the Gateway 21 office so I
can find it easily tomorrow.</p>

<p>Then I bought a 1000 yen suica (pass) for the JR lines and *then*
we ate ice cream.  I had an ice cream sandwich thing that basically
was ice cream in a hamburger bun shaped thing.  The bread was harder
than hamburger but softer than bagel, but basically tasteless.  I
determined that an ice cream filled doughnut would rule.</p>
