<p>Yesterday Yukiji helped me get to a travel agency, but I still
don't really feel like I can get all my connections connected for my
trip to Osaka et. al. with janette.</p>

<p>I got pissed off today when Rich came in and was all, "HI.  A
little piece of advice, don't say the book is wrong; I wasted five
minutes of my lesson correcting a student on an error you made
yesterday."</p>

<p>I silently crushed my aluminum drink bottle as he spoke to me.
"hmf."</p>

<p>Several minutes later I was like, "okay," and gave my opinion:</p>

<table border=1><tr><td>
<p>"My name is Rob."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He said his name was Rob."</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>That's ridiculous, but it's what the book says should be spoken in
that situation.  Fuck that.  My name is still Rob, so the last line
oughta be "He said his name is Rob."</p>

<p>Carla agrees with me that's it's dumb (the book), but what's SUPER
dumb is telling the students that this fucked up book is the all high
and mighty fucking bible of English.  It's a shit book.</p>

<p>"We have enough trouble getting the students to use the book as it
is, so don't tell them it's wrong."</p>

<p>At first I was like, <em>I will</em> never <em>concede this
point</em>, but then I talked to Phil who suggested that the book is
simplifying the language for the students.   So I don't have to say
that it's wrong, but it's being simplified.  And he showed me a page
in his (thicker) book that showed the nuances.  You rock, Phil.</p>

<p>I copied the page and I'll use it as my guide to augment the FUCKED
UP (oops) book if I get to that lesson again.</p>
