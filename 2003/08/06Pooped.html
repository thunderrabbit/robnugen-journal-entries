<p>Went to Subway to get a sandwich before meeting Aki.  Sat outside
under a tree and felt a huge raindrop on my shorts' pant leg.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  A big, warm raindrop.</p>

<p>Looked down.  Not a raindrop.  Bird poop. D'oh!  I wiped it off as
much as possible, and rinsed off in the restroom.  Ah well.</p>
