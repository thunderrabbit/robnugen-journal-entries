<p>I am choosing not to take my computer to Fujikyu Highland today.
Part of me has placed upon this adventure the need-to-be-perfect and
therefore wracked my brain plenty in deciding whether or not to take
my computer:</p>

<p>It could be stolen while I'm on the rides (breaking away from my
uber-trust of Japanese).  It would get heavy carrying it around all
day.  I can focus on Japanese learnin' with Nami without it.  I can
write emails while I'm waiting for Nami at Noburrito.  I mean
Noborito.</p>

<p>Then I came to: this trip is not my last adventure to FkH.  It's
not imperative that it be perfect.  Just.. fuckin', whatever dude.
's'coo, bro.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>leaving now.</p>
