<p class=date>12:00pm JST Monday 18 August 2003</p>

<p>I just sent 340,000 yen (actually (340,000 - 2000 yen) * [exchange
rate $/yen] - $10) back home.  I trust it went to the correct account;
I don't remember how the information was given to Lloyd's TSB; I think
I wrote it down for them.  Find out tonight.</p>

<p>The train is less than 1/2 full today.  I wonder why.</p>
