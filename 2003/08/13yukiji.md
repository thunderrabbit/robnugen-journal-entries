<p class=date>9:49pm JST Wednesday 13 August 2003</p>

<p>I wore leather shoes, slacks, shirt and tie for my meeting with
Lucy. I wanted to change clothes, but didn't want to go through Nova
to a restroom in our building, but that was the closest restroom to
Keikyu station where I was to meet Yukiki.  I tried to find a back way
to the restroom, and ended up just changing in a deserted stairwell in
the recesses of the building.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Met Yukiji just after 6pm and we walked to a family restaurant
nearby.  Japanese family restaurant.   Awesome.</p>

<p>Er, make that Denny's, Japanese style.  Not like fuckin' take off
yer shoes Japanese style, but hand out hot cloths before eating and
serve all kindsa crazy Japanese food instead of American favs.</p>

<p>Showed Yukiji the pics on my computer, zinging through all 1880 of
them in about 20 minutes after she aksed to see pics of my
girlfriend.</p>

<p>She gave me some Pera Pera Penguin pages to help with my Japanese,
and she hopefully learned a bit of English as well.</p>

<p>I'm thrilled that she's going to help me tomorrow, making
reservations for me-an-Janette's trip to Kyoto, Osaka, Nara,
Hakone.</p>
