<p class=date>9:12pm JST Thursday 28 August 2003</p>

<p>Easy day at work.  Hardest part was a four person class, but I only
had to observe the class being taught for me.  Nice.  The instructor
is Caroline, from Scotland.  Fun accent.</p>

<p>Best part at work was the man to man lessons in the beginning and
the man to man voice.  Maybe I'll be chatting with some more students
outside of class.</p>
