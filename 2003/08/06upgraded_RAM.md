<p>Pooh.  Quick Garage said they cannot fix my computer hinge *nor*
sell me any memory.  They gave me the Apple number so I called them
and they want me to *send them my computer* to have it fixed.  And it
could cost more than 10,000 yen (depending on what they have to
replace.  Fuck that.  I'll let it go for a while.  Shit they wanted my
password and everything.  If I give it to them, I'll change the
password to either something easy or something really fucked up and
claim that's my normal password.</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>Got more memory for my machine.  512Megs instead of 256M.  I can't
really tell that it's faster, but I've gotten glimpses of fasterness.
The glimpses are explainable by my expectation that it's faster, not
necessarily by actual fact.</p>

<p>7326 yen.</p>
