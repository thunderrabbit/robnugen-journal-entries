<p>Just watched a dumb movie with Frank.  He loved the movie.   This
is the second movie that he's loved that I pretty much didn't love.
The other one was okay, but not WOW.   This one was less than wow.
Just a bunch of cats talking.   But that's what Frank likes.
Talking.</p>

<p>But these cats were all being pretty mean to one another.  One plot
twist.</p>
