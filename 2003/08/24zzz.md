<p>Tried quite diligently to hack into Steve's website, but wasn't
able to.  Trying to figure out how to set up a BBST on my
site. Tantalizingly close to directories I need to see, but nope.</p>

<p>Tonight was Carla's birthday party.  Lyle bet me 300 yen I couldn't
do 60 pushups in 5 minutes.  Eric did 47.  I did 44. Benny did 60 in
less than 5 minutes.  Lyle did 60 in less time than it took Benny.</p>

<p>I enjoyed sitting next to Adriana for a bit and hearing about her
upcoming adventures in OZ and Italy translating.  I'm really excited
for her.  I wonder if I'll ever learn Japanese.</p>

<p>Gotta go to bed.</p>

<p>Oh, Yoshie canceled our Wednesday rollercoaster day.</p>
