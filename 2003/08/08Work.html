<p>At work Yukiji gave me 1/3 inch worth of photocopied sheets to
teach me Japanese.  Awesome!  She's the student who's been stuck in
level 5 for 2.5 years after zooming from 7C to 5 in 2.5 years.</p>

<p>She emailed me tonight and I just emailed her back.</p>

<p>Um, oh.  . .  Um, oh I called Gateway 21 and have an appointment
with Lucy in Shinjuku on Wednesday at 4pm.  I'll just yammer with them
a bit about possibly working for them maybe 1 day per week.  I have a
guess that won't be an option, but we will see.</p>
