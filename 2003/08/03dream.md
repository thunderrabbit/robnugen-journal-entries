<p class=dream>With some friends near a UU congregational meeting,
with a discussion about money.  I said, "the current system is that we
ask members to give money to individual congregations, and the
congregations are asked to give money to the UUA in order to be a
member of the UUA.  But the only fair way is to not require individual
members to give money, though we still require the congregation as an
entity to give money to the UUA.  This preserves individual liberties,
but still provides money to the UUA, *if* the UUA and separately, the
congregations provide something worthwhile to their members."</p>

<p>I wouldn't have written down this dream, but I woke up as I was
giving my little speech.</p>
