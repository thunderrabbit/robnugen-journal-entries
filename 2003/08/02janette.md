<p class=date>1:20am JST Sunday 3 August 2003</p>

<p>Had a long heart to heart talk with janette tonight.  We got
sidetracked by my need to hear how unique I am and she expressed to me
some of her innermost concerns.  She said she knows in her heart that
we're not meant for each other this lifetime.  I feel sad yet know the
same thing in my heart.  But it's like how great would it be to have
found the one (sounds like Morpheus).  So close but not quite.</p>

<p>Still so looking forward to her visit.  Still so happy to have her
as a friend, island, cheerleader, supporter.  Still can't wait to see
her.  And we're that much closer now.</p>
