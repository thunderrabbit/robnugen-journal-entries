<p>Awesome first lesson with Yumi via Gateway 21.  She's apparently
leaving Japan in December; that's when she's quitting her
job. (Gateway 21 is a travel agency with a side business of teaching
the language where people are traveling, so I assume the reason she's
quitting is to roll out of here.)</p>

<p>Speaking of rolling out, I gotta split cause I may otherwise be
late for my thing with Shin.</p>
