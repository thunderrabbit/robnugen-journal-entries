<p>Money.</p>

<p>(Why did I pick that up from Frank?)</p>

<p>Met with Lucy at Gateway 21 in Shinjuku.   It sounds like a sweet
setup.  Gateway 21 is actually a travel agency with a side business of
hooking up Japanese travelers with native speakers of the language
spoken in the country where the Japanese are planning to visit.
(How's that for a flocked up sentence?)</p>

<p>So, Lucy will contact me...  hey I never gave her my phone number
or email address; how strange is that?  hold please.</p>

<p>Ah fuckit.  I gave her my resume online and my email address is
there.</p>

<p>Anyway, she will contact me a week or two in advance and be all "yo
yo yo can you teach on Tuesday the __ at Npm?"  And I'll be all,
"heayeah; hook a brotha up!"   And then I meet with a student and have
a lesson in Gateway 21's office in Shinjuku and every month I get paid
2500 yen for every lesson I've taught.  And the student pays for my
transportation so I can get a teiki from my crib to Shinjuku and that
puts hella awesome stations on my free transit list.  Shibuya (for
hanging out with anyone who meets at Hachiko) and Shinjuku (largest
station in the world).  I was thinking it hooks me up with Shinagawa,
but it doesn't.  Ah well.</p>

<p>Speaking of Shinagwa, I'm arriving there now to zoom to Kawasaki to
meet with Yukiji at 6pm.</p>
