<p class=date>5:57pm JST Saturday 30 August 2003</p>

<p>Miki waved at me between classes and I smiled bigly at her during
the last class, through the glass between our rooms.  Mmmm.  She's
cute.</p>

<p>Today was Stephanie's first day.  She seemed to be sick at first; I
dunno if it was just nerves, because she seemed to make it throught
the day no problem.  Jen and Adriana, on the other hand, didn't even
*start* their days; they each tapatsued (our word for called in
sick).</p>

<p>Quote of the day:</p>

<pre>I won ten thousand, billion dollars in casino.</pre>

<p>I had topic voice on pronounciation today.  That went relatively
well.  Kenji consistently wouldn't shape his mouth to form W, V, B, R
sounds.  He's a pretty old cat; kinda set in his ways.  Most other
students did well.  One woman got all the words basically perfect,
except for "vocabulary," the most incorrectly pronounced English word
in Japan.  (other than "clothes")</p>
