<p class=date>9:07am JST Sunday 10 August 2003</p>

<p>Nice.  I got my .emacs file to work for creating journal entry
names for 1 or 2 digit dates.  Used to be I had to tweak it every 1st
and 10th of the month.</p>

<p>Slept later than I planned, but I'm on the bus no problem.  Had a
dream where</p>

<p class=dream>Steve and I were writing on a dry erase board, like
alternately writing and erasing without needing to ask what was
appropriate; we knew when it was okay to erase the others' work, or
add to it or whatever.  I wrote an I miss you YRUU kittens message,
and then it was a T-shirt we were giving to Fred for continuing the
Nugen legacy in YRUU.  After that we couldn't erase it anymore, so I
realized it was a dream and then realized I shouldn't be sleeping
because I had to be at work.  Eeek!</p>

<p>So I woke up and it was about 8:30.  Perfect timing.  Thank you
Angels.</p>
