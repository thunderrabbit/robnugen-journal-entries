<p>Lesson 1: man to man 7C.  No show.  I had actually prepared
(grabbed pairs of jobs flashcards), but ah well.</p>

<p>Lesson 2: Three level 4 women.  Kinda quiet, but did okay at
speculating the stories behind some funny pictures from _Life Smiles
Back_, a compilations of pics from Life Magazine's famous funny
photos.</p>

<p>Lesson 3: man to man level 4.  She was late, and was wearing some
safari looking outfit.  She goes, "I'm sorry I'm late; I was hunting
tigers."  Turns out we're both programmers.  Traded email
addresses.</p>

<p>Lesson 4: I traded with Benny my three level 5's for his man to man
level 6 guy who he didn't want to teach given the comments in the
file.  I had a nice chat with this cat.</p>

<p>Lesson 5: Two level 7A's.  Chef Masaru and new 7A Midori.  Lesson
was "not much" = "a little" and "not many" = "a few."  They did
aight.</p>

<p>Lunch: I learned from yuki how to say nishuukanmaekaraomricetabetemasen</p>

<p>Lesson 6: Had four 7As, including two talkative good students and
two not so good students (one stuttery and one quiet, who the teachers
(not me) call statuko cause she's like a statue).  I tried to pay
equal attention at different calibres of English to the factions, but
I favored the better students.</p>

<p>Lesson 7: (I don't remember; I didn't write it down)</p>

<p>Lesson 8: Two 7Bs: a real quiet kid named Kento and a chatty mom
(not his) named Tomoko.  I like her.  Gave her a level up 2 (Tony gave
her LU1 yesterday). She obviously studies effectively outside of
class.</p>
