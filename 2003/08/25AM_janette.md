<p>Janette called this morning and woke me up from a dream where I was
in a school situation and watching trays in a cafeteria be stacked in
two different stacks like disks being shot out of a zebra disk gun.</p>

<p>I was sleepin' and she wanted to go bikin' before a storm and when
she called me back I was on Frank's computer typin' and stuff, and she
was like, "there's a CRAZY storm with rain in sheets," etc, I was
like, Mmmmmmm storms, and then "lemme call you back" but we got
disconnected before I could finish my sentence and her phone just
rings and rings, so I figure they had a power outage from lightning.
I trust she's okay.</p>
