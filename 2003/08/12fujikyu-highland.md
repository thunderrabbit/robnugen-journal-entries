<p>The point of the previous story is that now my energy level is not
such that I want to write about Fujikyu Highland, even though it was
pretty pimp overall.  I will say that we rode King of Coasters 3
times, and I liked it better each time I rode it.  About 7 total
seconds of air time while riding in the back car, and just fucking
awesome manuevers.</p>

<p>The ride called Do Do Pa sucks.  I'll admit that it's fast, but it
does only one interesting manuever.  It's *NOT* worth a 2 hour wait in
line.  Maybe 15 minutes.  If the line extends outside the building,
skip it and go ride Mad Mouse, which is a much more taxing roller
coaster.</p>
