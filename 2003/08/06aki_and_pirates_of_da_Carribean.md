<p>On the train with Aki right about now - going to Cinecitta Kawaski
to seeeee Pirates of the Carribean.  Nice.</p>

<p>Aki is totally happier on the train than in the station cause
outside it's soo atsui to her.  Hot hot hot hot hot.</p>

<p>She's so funny.</p>

<p>Good movie.  I wonder if upon a second viewing some more details
would become apparent.  It reminded me of _Princess Bride_ in the
tone, humor, action, and period.</p>
