<p>Well.</p>

<p>I've got my computer back.  And it's absolutely *my* computer: the
data on the drive seems absolutely the same.  I'm most thankful for
that.</p>

<p>I will write to Jeff at Aloha Dude to get some more stickers.  (The
monkey and banana stickers were removed.)  Or maybe I won't.</p>

<p>The entire outer case is completely new.  There is still that
protective plastic sheeting on all the surfaces (except the
keyboard).  The keyboard is my old keyboard.  I can see the wear
marks.  That was the first indication that I wasn't starting
completely over with a whole new computer. </p>

<p>I'm really happy to have my computer back.</p>

<p>I'm really happy to have a whole new case, with two hinges that
work.  I'm mostest glad to have my data intact.</p>

<p>I do do backups nightly, but I've never restored the data; I don't
know how that process might go.</p>

<p>155,000 yen</p>
