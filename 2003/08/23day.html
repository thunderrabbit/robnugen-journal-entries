<p>Work was fine.  Gazed at Miki some while teaching my last lesson.
She was in a man to man with Adriana.  haha man to man</p>

<p>Went to see fireworks with Mika and Carla after work.  I had
previously seen smiley face firworks, but I had never seen Doraimon
fireworks nor Hello Kitty fireworks.  Nor sunglasses!  Didn't get any
pics of the sunglasses, but I got some of Doraimon.</p>

<p>Went to dinner with Carla and Mika in Yokohama at some izakiah
place.  I had my favorite food, but I've again forgotten the name.
Starts with a d or g.  Carla and I committed a heinous offence against
Japanese culture by passing a cheese ball via chopsticks.  I was like,
"you wanna cheese ball?" and chopsticked it to Carla, who took it with
her chopsticks, to Mika's horror.  "NO!"</p>

<p>Carla (vegetarian) thought maybe Mika was looking out for her, "is
there meat in them?" as she tried to pass it back to me.  Mika took
Carla's hand and placed the cheese ball on Carla's plate.  Explained
that the action of passing things with chopsticks is only done when
passing bones of the desceased to their final resting point or
something ike that. Who knew?</p>

<p>Actually I had heard it before and forgot.</p>

<p>Got home and found Frank all sunburned from climbing Mt Fuji, which
was much more grueling than he expected.</p>
