<p>Oh gosh, this is a bad idea.  I'm getting sidetracked on my site,
trying to do some perl magic so I can see comics dot com without all
the advertising and crap.  Similar to how Fred made a m-w
extractor.</p>

<p>Okay, okay, before I start, I'll mail Wende's letter and check my
calendar to make sure I'm not forgetting anything today.</p>

<p>(Like the 3pm appointment with Rie the travel agent at Shinjuku
station)</p>
