<p>I bid adeiu to Aki in Kawasaki station.  She prefers taking the
bus, yet she had already bought her ticket to ride the train home with
me before I remembered, and I didn't see her on the platform after I
said bye, so I wonder if she did in fact use the train to get home.
Mystery.</p>

<p>So instead of going home, I'm in Akihabara at the Macintosh
computer place to get two things hopefully: 1) the hinge fixed, and 2)
more memory.  MMMmmmmmmmm, memory.</p>

<p>After this I'm rolling over to Shibuya to see if T3 is playing in
Shibuya on this coming Sunday evening, and if so, when I can buy
tickets.</p>
