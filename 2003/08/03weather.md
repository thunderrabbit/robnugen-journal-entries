<p>Okay, I did a bit of research (oh, I talked to my dad tonight and
that was fun to catch up with him.  We didn't do a full 100% catchup,
but definitely got more than everything is fine) on weather in <a
href="http://www.weather.com/weather/climatology/monthly/77001">Houston</a>
and <a
href="http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/climatology/monthly/JAXX0085">Tokyo</a>.</p>

<p>According to weather.com, Tokyo gets about 1.5 inches more rain
than Houston per year, though Houston's rain is more evenly spread
throughout the year.  (Tokyo 55.4 inches | Houston 54.0 inches)</p>

<p>Houston is definitely hotter than Tokyo.  The average is 94 F and
93 F in July and August in Houston (I'm surprised that the average in
August is cooler than July), but only 83 F and 87 F in July and August
in Tokyo.  They're only 87 for one month.  We're 90-few for
<em>two</em> months.  So our summer is hotter and lasts longer.</p>

<p>For fun, I looked up <a
href="http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/climatology/monthly/ASXX0002">Alice
Springs</a>: (avg 96F, 97F, 95F in Dec, Jan, Feb.  Only 12 inches of
rain per year)</p>

<p>(note to self: do not retire in Alice Springs)</p>

<br>What is interesting to me is how the atmospheric and oceanic circulation differences next to Tokyo and Houston result in the precipitation and temperature differences you wrote about... I go read about it now.<br>
