<p>Hahaha  I kick off the day with three free lessons.  Sweet.  Then a
man to man then I get lunch.  Then another free.  My last three
lessons I teach a total of 5 students.   Sweet.</p>

<p class=date>3:25pm</p>

<p>Woo.</p>

<p>My first >M&lt; lesson got switched from a 7C student to a level 6
student.  That's good news.  The better news is that this level 6
student is the one that said, "Why don't we go to dinner?" when I
asked her to give examples of "Why don't ..."  I didn't answer
positively then because it was our first lesson, and (mostly) because
Yukiji (or was it Satoko?) was nearby and I didn't want to be overtly
seeing two students - trying to lower my risk of being caught.  (In
ways other than not writing about my adventures online.)</p>

<p>She has my email now.</p>
