study now.</p>

<p>Man, Ayana is cool.  I was feelin' all crappy about how much
Japanese I don't know and she did a review with me and helped me
recoginize how much Japanese I *do* know, and pointed out two areas
that I need to work on: adjectives and verb vocabulary.  I was pretty
proficient with stuff like, "I study at 2:00 at the library" and "the
pen is in/on/under/behind/(in front/to the left/to the right) of the
phone" and okay at te form conjugation.</p>

<p>Felt much better after seeing my progress.</p>
