<p class=date>3:57pm JST Tuesday 26 August 2003</p>

<p>Went to Sankeien Garden near Sakuragicho, kinda tucked away in the
back alleys next to a neighborhood.  I was generally impressed with
the thick stone stockroom (into which we were not allowed), but
generally not so impressed with everything else.  I must be in a bad
mood.</p>

<p>I chatted with a cat named Kyo, and a woman named Chen.  Kyo is
from Burma, and Chen is from Taiwan.  She knows Mandarin, Cantonese,
English, Japanese.  Of course I don't know as much about Kyo, but he
seemed pretty cool and I gave him my email address so he could send me
some of the pics he took.</p>

<p>It was nice (the garden), but it was, I am guessing, far removed
from how it used to be.  Change happens, but they tried to pretend it
wasn't happening.  Fire extinguishers in ancient rooms, and concrete
benches made to look like wood.  Ah well.  whatever.</p>

<p>My arms are sore as FUCK from those pushups I did.  Embarassingly
sore.  I did 44 pushups in 5 minutes and I'm paying for it now.  My
triceps (I think) are so tight that it's super painful to bend my
arms; I need to let them relax.  I've been self accupressuring them,
and thinking about accupuncture and wondering where the right spots
are to press.</p>
