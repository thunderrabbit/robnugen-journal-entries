<p class=dream>Getting ready to go to gymnastics, I was back at my
dad's house in my old room, but like back there again (now) not in the
past and I had grabbed a soft t-shirt, but it was long sleeved, and I
grabbed a short sleeve shirt that flaired at the bottom but it was all
itchy, so I put on a t-shirt underneath it and then put on the
flair-ey soccer shirt with holes in it and then put on a 'mask' of
plastic fishnet material over my face as a mokc way to hide my face.
There were two Bill Cosby LPs on my reord player and I had left them
out and made a mental note to clean them up some day soon.Right after
I get back from gymnastics maybe.</p>
