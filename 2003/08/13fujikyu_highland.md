<p>Fujiyama, the King of Coasters, is really sweet.  We rode it 3
times and I liked it more and more each time I rode it.</p>

<p>The coaster offers like  7 seconds of total freefall time for the
back car and does the final close-to-the-ground curve to go back to
the beginning REALLY fast. Why? Cause IT'S NOT OVER!   3 more crazy
shake-a-brain humps back and forth like a skater in a halfpipe and
then it's over WHOAH no it's not!  one more crazy hump and Wow.  NOW
it's over - What a ride!!</p>

<p>That coaster is basically worth the trip to FkH, if one is already
in Tokyo.</p>
