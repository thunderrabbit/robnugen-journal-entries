<p class=date>4:45am JST Sunday 10 August 2003</p>

<p>I slept after work, and have just spent 2 hours (!) ???  writing 2
emails and being WAY sidetracked on this thing called Dashboard that
looks pretty cool, but is hardly ready for consumer consumption.</p>

<p>Sally is interested in the source of my journal, and I'm tempted to
run through and pull together a "releaseable" version ("releaseable" =
"here's some shit that works for me, good luck!"), but that would be
another tangent, I fear.  Do I have more pressing issues?</p>

<p>Mmmmmmm...   my room is a disaster area.  argh.</p>

<p>Get up get up; check the status of important things in my life.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Ah.  Need to see about getting shit reserved for when janette comes
and confirm meeting with Yukiji.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Emailed yukiji.  I need to stop waiting for Yasuko to respond with
train schedule information.  Fuck!</p>

<p>My server is responding too slowly for me to navigate around and
fuck with source code, so I'm not going to do that now.</p>

<p>Back to sleeep.</p>

<p>I would just stay up today and sleep crazy long tonight after work,
but I'm going to see T3 with Nami tonight after work!</p>

<br>this is how bad i am:  reading that getting shit reserved for when janette comes, is more important right now than finding the source of your journal(what does That mean,anyway?)for sally,(this is sally in cali,no?) makes me happy in an ego-aries way.  after playing second fiddle(Not an ego-aries way) to sally for so long ....<br>
  feels nice in a selfish-yay for me way.<br>
