<p>pretty fuckin' late.</p>

<p class=date>11:29pm</p>

<p>My evening is winding down.  I'm on my train now to head back home
from Kannai.  What a debacle getting to Kannai; in Shinagawa, the
train I wanted was waiting for me, which is pretty rare since it
doesn't run very frequently.  Tonight was even less frequent; the
train should have left 45 minutes previously.  That's fucked up late.
Turns out there had been some human incidents on the track.</p>

<p>(i.e. humans jumped in front of the train in their last desperate
solution to all the problems life in Japan has to offer.)</p>

<p>Took a <em>PACKED</em> train to Kawasaki and a <em>PACKED</em>
train to Yokohama, then got a tad lost finding the way to Kannai and
was directed to the train as opposed to the subway, though I clearly
(in English) said Kannai Subway, so when I arrived in Kannai I had to
walk 400 meters to the subway station, and as I was on the phone to
Shin, walking down into the subway station my phone cut out from being
too far underground.  Bah.</p>

<p>He found me and we walk walk walked to a Korean restaurant, while
being asked by bystanders if we wanted a drink or a massage.  Men
said, "nomigateka?" (maybe) and women said, "massaji, massaji?" and
one of them actually grabbed my arm as we walked by.  I wondered what
the experience might be like if I accepted her offer, or maybe acted
angry for her grabbing my arm.</p>

<p>I wonder if such a massage could actually help my aching arms.</p>
