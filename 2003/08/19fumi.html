<p>Feeling much better after taking a long walk with Fumi around
Shibuya.  Not *around* the station, but in a big circuit near the
station, including Harajuku station!  I was like wtf!  We
<em>walked</em> to Harajuku!  Wow!  Supa surprised was I.</p>

<p>Oh, before I was surprised by that, I was surprised to find us next
to a Jur-oops I shouldn't say; I want to take janette there when she
comes.  Look for an entry for 30 September 2003 (not yet, silly!).</p>

<p>Speaking of time, I was late to meet Fumi, due to Yahoo! BB
chitchat, so I bought dinner for her ($4) at a deli place that I'd
also like to take janette to when she comes.  I'm glad we came across
it!</p>
