<p class=date>4:39pm JST Monday 25 August 2003</p>

<p>I have just filled out my holiday request form. Basically off 26
September - 9 October, but working on Saturday 27 September while
janette sleeps slash does whatever.</p>

<p>While I was at Kawasaki getting the request forms, Bill gave me the
email and phone number of a student who wants to hang out with me
(Miki).  Bill already told her that I have a girlfriend and she still
wants to hang out so I emailed her.</p>
