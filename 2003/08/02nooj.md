<p>Top n reasons my brother is cool:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He sent me something in the mail</p></li>

<li><p>He reused the cardboard envelope (which Jackie had sent to me
and) that I sent to him</p></li>

<li><p>He wrote me a letter on an envelope</p></li>

<li><p>He sent a CD in an AOL CD case.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>((Now, I'm thinking that he did *not* send me an AOL CD.  Let's find out.))</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Haha.   The envelope is a barf bag and over 1/2 the words are
spelled in honor of Mark Twain.</p></li>

<li><p>The protective packaging was two AOL CD promotional
cardboard things that he got from the post office.  To decrease the
overall weight, he threw away (or microwaved) the booklets and CDs
that had been in the cardboard.</p></li>

<li><p>Wow.  The gift is _Be_ by <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/stevefeinstein/">Steve Feinstein</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Funny: I put the CD in last night and my computer overheated, so I
couldn't finish the entry at that time.</p>
