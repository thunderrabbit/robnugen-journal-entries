<p>Got a text from Satoko, who got her visa, so she can go to Cali in
September!  Whoohoo for her!  I'm really excited; I think goin' abroad
is tha best way to learn a langauge.</p>

<p>Called her back to congratulate her.  And to also say I was like
"get out of here all you other voice people; I want to talk to
Satoko!"</p>
