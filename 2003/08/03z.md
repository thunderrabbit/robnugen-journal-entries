<p class=date>5:00am JST Monday 4 August 2003</p>

<p>Ah geez!  Stupid morning!</p>

<p>In the process of going to bed, I saw that Frank was watching _Red
Dragon_.  <em>Ah.  Red Dragon.</em>  So I watched it with him.</p>

<p><b>Now</b> as I'm going to bed, it's fully light outside!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Frank says that he should have just killed himself and be done with
it.  "That's a much more interesting ending - choosing to end his
serial killer career for love."</p>

<p>"But I liked Ralph Fienne's tattoo.  That was money."</p>

<p>I'm going to bed now soon as I finish this entry and copy it to my
site.  Will meet Satoko at noon at Cinecitta for lunch.</p>

<p>ps: Frank watched the eyeball chewing scene twice.</p>
