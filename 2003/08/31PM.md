<p class=date>5:36pm JST Sunday 31 August 2003</p>

<p>Work was aight though no voice nor frees.  Couple man to mans.  But
excellent news: I'm working at KQ on Saturdays this month (September).
That rules.</p>

<p>The stinky news is that I have to be at Kawasaki more often when
Steve is there. That stinks.  But I'll get over it.</p>
