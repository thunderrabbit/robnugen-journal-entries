<p>Doh.</p>

<p>The hinge on the other side of my monitor broke.  Now the screen
won't come on at all.  Gotta send the shit in to have it repaired.</p>


<p>Good Things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It happened while Frank's computer is still in the house.</p></li>
<li><p>They'll come pick up my machine for me.</p></li>
<li><p>It won't cost too much.</p></li>
</ol>
