<p>Now *this* is rain.</p>

<p>I can hear it pelting the shit out of the roof of this train
station.  I saw the dark clouds out toward the direction my train line
goes, so I brought my umbrella.  :-)</p>

<p>how ironic to have such a storm </p>

<p>doh</p>

<p>I was saying how ironic to have such a storm now *after* the rainy
season has been declared over.  :-)  I love big storms, so I'm
certainly not complaining.   But there's no thunder n lightning.  Just
rain.  But big rain.   Good job, weather.</p>

<p>Just at that moment, while on the train, my phone rang.  I knew it
must be Fumi, and the train hadn't left the station yet.  I lept up
with the phone in one hand, my computer in another hand and my bag in
another hand and jumped toward the closing doors.  I got my bag into
the door </p>

<p class=date>5:52pm</p>

<p>SHIT!</p>

<p>Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck</p>

<p>okay.</p>

<p>... and with both hands, pressed as hard as I could to force the
doors back open.  They relinquished; it wasn't like I did a superhuman
feat; I just got crunched for a bit until they opened.</p>

<p>Talked to Fumi.  "It's raining" "yeah okay, we'll meet in Shibuya
at the end of the Tokaido line."</p>

<p>Looked down at my computer.  It was working, but one of the four
hinge-points on the screen was broken.</p>

<p>Shit.</p>

<p>Got back on the next train.</p>

<p>Couple stations later I was like, "why am I in a tunnel?"  And then
I realized why and wrote "SHIT!" and "Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck"
above.</p>

<p>Wrong train line.  It went down into the subway instead of up to
Shibuya.  Doh!!!</p>

<p>Fumisan called me as I was 5 minutes late and inquired.</p>

<p class=date>6:37pm</p>

<p>Now we are in a restaurant near Shibuya.  Desserts and more
desserts.</p>

<p>Mmmmm. Dessert.</p>
