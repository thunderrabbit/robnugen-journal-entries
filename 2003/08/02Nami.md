<p>Hung out with Nami after work.  Ended up sitting for 2 hours next
to the steps leading from Kawasaki station down into Azalea.  She
really encouraged me to use Japanese, (moreso than any other teacher
has.  At the same time, she is the most English-fluent Japanese that I
know.  She's probably level 3.) and I told her in Japanese the story
of obtaining a bike, losing the bike, losing my wallet, having Koko
help me recover from the wallet loss, and her mom driving us to get
the bike.  Wow.</p>

<p>We might go to Fujiku Highland together on 12 August!</p>

<p>I told her in English the story of how I met janette and my 5000 +
6000 mile road trip.</p>
