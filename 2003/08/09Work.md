<p>Hmm.  Today was lovely cause I had a busy schedule at first, but
then got to close out the day with a light schedule: kids, then man to
man, then voice, then man to man.</p>

lesson was awesome; ‚Ð‚©‚è is 8 and really good.  I went through the ASL
alphabet with her and she told me how to sign thank you in Japanese (I
think).  So I taught her how to say "thank you," and how to say "I'm 8
years old" in ASL.</p>

<p>She took off my glasses and I took a picture (with my phone of
course) of her.  Oh, and she drew me a picture.  Oh, and when she
couldn't remember how to ask "how old are you?" I mouthed the words
and she got it.  Nice.</p>
