<p>Got everything reserved for janette and I when she comes.</p>

<p>I paid a deposit and will pay the rest when I get paid next
month.</p>

<p>Differences between Japan and US: this travel agency doesn't accept
credit cards.  this travel agency looked up everything in books and
wrote up my itenerary by hand.</p>
