<p class=date>8:58am JST Friday 8 August 2003</p>

<p>Woke up.  Worked on redoing my navigation.  Internet connectivity
slowed.  Took a nap.  janette called to say HI.  HI!  She's calling
Maggie now.  I'm glad they're connecting.</p>

<p class=date>10:41am</p>

<p>After some hours of work spread over a couple weeks or more, I have
released the new navigation system on my site.  I like it.</p>

<br>also, one of the coolest things was how  your site changed as i read it!  it appeared one way, then blinked and came on as another.<br>
i feel like i was a witness to HISTORY.<br>
