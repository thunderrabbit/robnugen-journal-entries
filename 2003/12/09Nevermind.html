<p>I was working on my drawing when I got a page from janette,
  "nevermind," the previous page for which had been "pls call me,"
  and I was like hh hh hh and called her anyway.  Almost a mistake,
  but we made it good in the end.  This work of honesty is really
  hard and rewarding.</p>

<p>I may go back to Austin to work on this chaos within me.</p>
