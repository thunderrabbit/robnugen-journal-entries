<p>Morag and I studied on Friday night after work.  She agreed that
  she and I are closer to the same than I thought the previous night.
  We both have lists of potential mates and we both kick the
  potentials off the list before the long term relationships happen.
  She just kicks off before a short term relationship can happen.</p>

<p>release release release</p>

<p>release and allow positive thought forms to manifest themselves
  around my being.  yay</p>
