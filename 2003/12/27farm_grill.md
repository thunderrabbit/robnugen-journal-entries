<p class=date>12:39am JST Sunday 28 December 2003</p>

<p>Ate at Farm Grill in Ginza, the restaurant DruDaddy and that guy
  and I ate at some months ago, maybe to celebrate our end of
  probation paychecks.  Large buffet and all I can drink and good
  stuff like that.  Lubo, あいこ, Grace, Kat, かおり, Dan, Orivia, Jen
  and I were there for two hours (time limited) of chowing.</p>

<p>Rode on the train beside かおり who helped me study my vocab flash
  cards (need to buy some more; I lost my new set, but most of them
  were blank; I'm happy about that) which I was quite happy to do
  instead of sitting with the Went home to 綱島 with the group and
  they drank more at the izakiah they frequent near the station.
  Morag joined us after a while.</p>

<p>M-dawg and I were wide eyed at each other as the drunken sillifolk
  repeatedly trying to photograph a little 1.5 inch tall David Beckham
  doll with an oversized head as he dove into a glass of ice
  water.</p>

<p>"Aw, too late.  Okay, one more time."</p>

<p>Over and over and over.</p>
