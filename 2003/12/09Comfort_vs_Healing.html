<p>From my dear Maggie:</p>

<pre>
  Comfort vs. Healing - 
Comfort feels good.  Comfort can be found quickly and applied at
request to where we hurt most.  But there's a big drawback to comfort,
it requires something outside of ourselves.  Comfort covers our wounds
so we don't have to look at them and we can pretend they're not there.
Comfort may even find a way to trick us into thinking the wound is
gone.  However, since comfort requires an outside source, when the
outside source is gone, we learn that the wounds are still there,
sometimes even worse than before the comfort.  So we typically look
for comfort again hoping for the oblivion, even if it will only be
temporary.  Healing is hard.  Healing takes work and can not be found
quickly.  Healing is a force of our will to make a wound whole again.
Healing takes time and the healing process can feel worse than the
wound sometimes.  Healing has to be done without an outside source
(aside from God, who is really a force that works within us, I think)
The good news about healing is that when we've undergone our process,
the wound is gone, for real.  Some people seek comfort and some people
seek healing.  You get to choose.  My Friend, I think that it is
within you to heal your pattern with women, but it may be more
difficult since women are such a source of comfort to you.
