<p class=date>8:59pm JST Saturday 6 December 2003</p>

<p>I'm going to bed soon.</p>

<p>Colleen wrote me a letter and I wrote her back immediately; it
  feels good to have accomplished that.</p>

<p>I still don't know the reset password to my site.</p>

<p>Today Clayton taught じゅんこ the lyric "I love it when you call me
  big poppa" and the phrase "whatchoo talkin' bout foo?"  It's really
  cute/funny to hear her say these.</p>

<p>Morag was unげんき at the beginning of her day, but she genkked up
  after that.   I texted her to see if she would like to hang or chow
  with me tonight but never got a reply.  So much for text me
  anytime, I guess.</p>

<p>Work was fucked up busy at first and I had early lunch, but no one
  tupattsued which makes things much smoother.  I think this is the
  first non-topattsu Saturday in a while.   (that term is what we say
  when someone calls in sick. I'm not sure if it's Japanese or where
  it came from (or how to spell it))</p>

<p>Okay bedtime.</p>
