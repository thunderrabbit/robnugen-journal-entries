<p>I flat decided I would not see Miki tonight; I told her I'd call
  her if I got home soon enough, but then I was like fuckit; talking
  to janette is <em>far</em> more important at this juncture and I
  texted Miki to say sorry ol' chap.  I told her generally the
  situation; that I like her and janette's not happy about that and
  I'm feeling crummy about not being able to maintain focus for an
  extended remix relationship.  A mix, maybe, but certainly not an
  extended remix.</p>

<p>She's like roger doger and I'm left wondering wtf is up in my
  mind.  wtf I'm supposed to be doing, wtf is the point of all this
  insanity and wtf to tell janette.</p>

<p>If I get no input from janette then she should still come to Japan
  and I won't see Miki while janette is here and I won't do more than
  hang with Miki before janette gets here.</p>

<p>If I get negative feedback from janette, then I'm like send my
  shit to Maggie's house and I'll buy 1/2 your Japan ticket and we
  both do whatever we want.</p>

<p>If I get positive feedback from janette, I have to stick with my
  first option.</p>

<p>I'm home now.  Have nearly finished eating (it's like gorging;
  today I've eaten two rice balls with a dab of sushi each, so I
  think I'm hungry and I just chowed this shit down) and I'm going to
  call janette in 55 minutes.</p>

<p>I think meditation is in order.  I think one of my patented (*)
  Typewritten Meditations is in order.</p>

<p>(*) not patented</p>
