<p>I'm proud of myself and of who I am.</p>

<p>I'm proud of janette for doing her work.</p>

<p>I'm proud of myself for doing my work.</p>

<p>Today in the shower I mentally told Neil off in the break room.
  All Warrior, nothing sideways.</p>

<p>But I judge my work is not a safe container.  It is, however, what
  I make of it.</p>

<p>I get that I'm losing some of the skills that I learned in my
  I-group.  Less often do I integrate the 4-point protocol for
  clearing.  I wonder about that.</p>

<p>(wonder how much is more a part of me than I know, if there are
  warriors in Japan, if I can bring it here (a project I've...  hmmm
  (new idea brewing)), wonder if I'm just a silly rabbit)</p>
