<p>Went to half price okonomiyaki with Miki tonight.  Fun stuff.  It
  was really cold outside afterward watching the fountains at
  Cinecitta.</p>

<p>I fell asleep and missed Musashi Kosugi by two stations.  Woke up
  one station past as the doors were closing.  Made it back in time
  for the last train.</p>

<p>It's getting to be fucking freezing here in Tokyo.  Boooooo.</p>
