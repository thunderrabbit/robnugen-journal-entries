<p>One goal was to get good headway done on my studying.  I'm keen (*)
  on learning the kanji for these words; kanji are easier than I
  expected for me to learn, but I don't have a kanji stroke order
  dictionary.  I looked up the stroke order for 食 of 食べる and the
  dictionary I found showed an order I would not have predicted, so
  much so that I wanted to find another dictionary to confirm it.  I
  didn't find another dictionary for that kanji, but I did find a
  different dictionary for a diffferent kanji that the first
  dictionary had and they show slightly different stroke orders.

<p>The *point* of this entry is that I didn't actually get any real
  studying done, but felt just bluh after being online for so long
  and then realized I should have just stuck with hiragana to
  practice the verb conjugations which is what I wanted to actually
  practice anyway.  Oh well.  I'm going to nap for a bit (?) and then
  study in the morning.</p>

<p>Ooh progress: The cat on AOL says the stroke order may not be
  correct.  Money (**)</p>

<p>(**) I picked up "money" from Frank.  Dammit.</p>
