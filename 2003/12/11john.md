<p>New roommate moved in today.  Kinda short notice, but he's been in
  Nova for about a month and had a 70 minute train ride to work each
  way and wanted to move closer.  He's unhappy with his new room cause
  there's mildew in it and he might move again.  I trust all will work
  out for what's best.</p>
