<p>Watched <em>Changing Lanes</em> today with Dan and John. Before
  the movie started John moved on the chair and it made a farting
  noise and he goes, "haha, that sounds kinda bad doesn't it?" in a
  way that made me think <em>grow up.  Say "excuse me" or "ooh nice
  one" or something that's at least one step above an implication of
  a joke but not actually a joke</em>.</p>

<p>I ignored him like I hadn't heard him.</p>

<p>But then, he laughed when, in the movie, a guy at a 12 step meeting
  goes, "I've been sober for 15 days."  That shit is *not* funny.
  Really wonder why I'm getting so worked up about him.</p>

<p>I noticed yesterday that he reminds me of Alan M from
  Telecheck.</p>
