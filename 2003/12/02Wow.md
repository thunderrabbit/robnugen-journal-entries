<p>janette wasn't as genki as I thought she'd be and then she told me
  she sent me a comment.  Oh.  I see now.  </p>

<p class=date>4:52pm JST Tuesday 2 December 2003</p>

<p>Fuck a duck this has been the nuttiest day kinda emotionally I
  guess.  I was like GRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGRRRRRRARRRRRRRRRRR! when
  janette was talking like not coming to Japan and I'm like fuck Miki
  I'll never see her again if that's what it takes to get you to Japan
  and I'm like damn what is all this about and then I have to ZOOM off
  to meet Liz who I asked on a moment's notice to come translate for
  me at this apartment locator place and i was coughing and short of
  breath cause I hauled ass there, running a newly-red light before
  the cross traffic could bite me, and zooming over the bridge with
  the traffic and Liz and this cat were yammering a million miles per
  hour and I'm like fuck this living in Japan shit I just want to go
  home; fuck learning anything else, and I was in a pretty pissy mood
  about janette and Miki fiasco into which I've gotten myself and
  spilled it all to Liz who was like, "this is your new chance to
  start your new life in Japan" and I'm like, FUCK THAT I'm not going
  to start a new life; this is my fucking life; I'm in it right now
  and the answer, according to all the movies and books, the answer is
  inside me, but why can't I fucking see it?</p>

<p>And we went to the Prince Hotel and i  helped her with her speech
  and really wrote a good little number for her, including a good
  joke that Japanese English-speaking audience should get and we
  chowed and looked out over the city and I felt better (eating at
  least once a day is a good thing I'm sure)</p>

<p>Zoom back home and I'm on the edge of late to meet まさひこ at
  5:10pm at 綱島 station cause he was like, "how about you spend the
  night at my house tonight and we'll get an early start in the
  morning" and I'm like, "ummmmmm okay" cause i never say no (fuck
  that, I'm learning to say no, but I chose not to say no to him (I
  miss my fucking I group goddammit)) and I run myself ragged busy
  and I haven't done my laundry today, but now I'm about to go meet
  him and begin some new adventure, but I just wanted to rant and
  write what has happened so far.</p>

<p>Finish.  ありがと。</p>
