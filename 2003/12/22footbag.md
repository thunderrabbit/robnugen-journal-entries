<p>Ali and I hackey sacked as part of the Kawasaki Haki Saki
  competition.  He got 14 (again) and we both did some pretty fly
  stuff (for us) and I can see that my skills are getting better than
  they were when I played barefoot in YRUU.  Flat top shoes help.  I
  did some stalls and some outside kicks.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>We had put our coats and backpacks on and then started playing.
  Got really into it and began to take off backpacks and coats until
  we were back down to our work clothes.  Pretty funny.</p>
