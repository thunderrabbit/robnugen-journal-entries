<p>I'm not sure that I could study slower than I am today (since 6am)
  and actually still call it studying.</p>

<p>I have smurfed a list of kanji from <a
  href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~kanji/">Dartmouth.edu's kanji
  website</a> and used it to learn stroke order of some kanji verbs.
  So far, two: 食べる and 見る。 I have, in addition to learning the
  stroke order, written four short sentences with each of these kanji,
  using the short (informal) conjugations for did/didn't/do/don't
  meanings.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that my sentences are semantically correct; I just
  want them to be grammatically correct.</p>

<p>Zoooming now; I've just done four sentences for 飲みる。</p>

<p>I definitely made Japanese study progress today.  Nice.</p>
