<p class=dream>At KTRU but I wasn't supposed to be the one DJing and I
  turned off the station when I left, kinda thinking that the signal
  must be coming from somewhere else than this studio, as I was not
  the official DJ for that timeslot.  I walked out of the studio,
  which was like a kiosk sized building in the middle of an entrance
  to a university and Ali came up some stairs (from underground) to be
  like, "what happened?"  except he goes, "was that Scott or J-lo who
  just left the station?" "what do you mean? There is no one there
  now" "cause you just went off the air."  and it was only then that I
  realized that *had* been the signal and I was mad that they were
  doing a half ass job of DJing, or actually a no ass job cause they
  weren't even there; what kind of thinking is that; anyone can just
  put on a single CD and leave the studio.  In fact, it is an FCC
  violation to do that, to leave the station unattended.  So I went
  back in there to start DJing and woke up.</p>
