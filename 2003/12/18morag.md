<p>Hung out with Morag after work today and told her about my list of
  crushes and that for a while, she was on my list.  Turns out she has
  a similar list of crushes (similar in its crushiness, dissimilar in
  its contents).  We discussed our patterns and the list, it seems,
  is where the similarity ends.  She is quick to kick people off her
  list, whereas I must try to kick people off my list before it grows
  unweildy in its size.  She hasn't dated in a long while and I
  haven't not dated in a long while.</p>

<p>I told her briefly my addiction and more extensively what Rebecca
  Montgomery, Char Crofut, and Richard Unger told me.  You gonna be
  huge.</p>
