<p class=dream>I was talking to a guy and we had to use two words that
  had the same hiragana and make like a crossword puzzle with
  them.</p>

<p>There was more, but I read janette's ultra-super-emails before
  writing.  I don't remember.</p>

<p>Wow.  C-c C-v works on emacs now!</p>

<p>I remember more of my dream</p>

<p class=dream>I was living with some women roommates, including a
  Morag-energy and her roommate Lisa-energy woman.  Morag and I were
  past the sexual tension and were chilling (in the bathtub) together
  (with clothes on, in the water, but not soaked) and Lisa came in and
  offered to have sex with us and I was like "yeah" partially, but I
  knew it would be inappropriate so I was like, "naw," and then I
  realized it was a dream, so I was like, "yeah," but then it was too
  late.</p>

<p class=dream>My roommate left a mess in the restroom.</p>
