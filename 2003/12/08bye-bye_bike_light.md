<p>Dammit.  Someone stole the light off my bike during the 36 hours
  that I left it locked in ¿Ó∫Í°£ Fuck.  Well I hope they enjoy it.  I
  was just about to recharge the batteries on it, too. I'm glad I
  hadn't *just* recharged them.  4000 yen light and 1200 yen
  rechargeable batteries.  Sigh.</p>

<p>But good news is it will take about three hours of work to make
that much money back.</p>

<p>Other good(?) news is most bikes on the road (though it was fully
  dark) didn't have lights on.</p>
