<p>Funny quote at work today.  Um, dammit; I threw away my paper um...</p>

<p>No, that's not the quote; I really threw away the paper.</p>

<p>But something I do remember from work: oh, two things:</p>

<p>1) On the way leaving my apartment, I put my shoes on (like normal)
  but when I got to work I realized I had on my casual shoes and not
  my work shoes.  Good news is that <em>all the ATs</em> were at a
  meeting so I got away with no one calling me on them.
  Muwahahaha.</p>

<p>2) On the way leaving work, なお and あすこ were like, "yo Rob, one
  of the students says she likes your lessons best."  And I was like,
  "wha?" and wondered if they meant she liked Kawasak and they were
  like, "no, your lesson... and she's level three!" and I was like,
  "wow." cause yeah, well, wow and pretty much really happy to hear
  that so I went back and found the student's file to see if I could
  remember who she is, but I can't.  I remember the lesson kinda, but
  not what she looks like.  Student's name is なおこ。</p>

<p>Only 32 more lessons until my weekend.  Oh, and tomorrow I get to
  hang with Morag at KQ!  EEeeee!</p>
