<p>Hung out with Miki tonight after work.  Grar; what am I doing?</p>

<p>Studying, for one thing.</p>

<p>Miki doesn't know that I'm considering staying.  I don't know if
  I'm considering staying.  I don't know what I'm doing in Japan.  I
  don't really think I can go back home; I don't really have a
  concrete plan for anything, but I know I don't really want to sign
  up for Nova again in March.  The reason: I don't go to work all
  happy; I'm more like counting the hours until I can go home.</p>
