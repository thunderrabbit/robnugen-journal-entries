I love what Caulfield is wearing!  Ice skates on a chair!  I've tried
to wear inline skates and drive a car (kinda easy), ride a bicycle
(pretty easy), ride a unicycle (not as easy) and ride a skateboard
(basically impossible).  But I've never tried to slide down a hill on
chair in a big bowl while wearing ice skates.

Thank you for the word convalescence.

HAHA!  may I make a copy of this for my website?  It will soon be
buried in my journal and I'll link to comics.com/frazz Many people
ride bikes and talk on phones here in Japan; we teachers complain
about it a lot.  (and do it ourselves on occassion)

I hope your holidays rule.

<p>Jef Mallett is the cartoonist and is cool because he's bigtime (in
my estimation) *and* he responds to my emails.</p>

Thanks! The sledding outfit is something from my past,
no doubt. Where do all the adults come from, anyway?
And, given things like driving with cell phones, where
do all the old adults come from? It's amazing any of
us live to see another day!

By all means, link that web site to Frazz. Thanks!
