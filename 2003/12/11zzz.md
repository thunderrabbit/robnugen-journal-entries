<p>Oh my god.</p>

<p>How did it become midnight already?</p>

<p>I learned that the IRS is overbudget and well delayed in upgrading
  their computer system, but they'll be screwed soonishly as the old
  cats who know the old system are going to retire soon.</p>

<p>I looked through some of the mysterious files in my file system to
  see what I can see.  I renamed the OS 9 folder to see if I really
  need it.  That's probably dangerous, but oh well.</p>

<p>aight bedtime!</p>
