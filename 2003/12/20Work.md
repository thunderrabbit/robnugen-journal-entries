<p>Today at work I found that I was happier and bantered more with
  Benny and Carla et. al. more than months prior.  Not sure what is
  the difference, but I'm releasing the need to know that.  I'm
  having more fun.</p>

<p>After work I wondered about transferring to a remoter part of
  Japan, to see what that life would be like.</p>
