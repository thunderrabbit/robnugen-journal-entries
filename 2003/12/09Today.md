<p class=date>4:42pm JST Tuesday 9 December 2003</p>

<p>I hung out with あつこ at the かわ for a few hours, studying and
  helping her study and talking about みき and janette.  She (Atsuko)
  is definitely of the camp that I should stay in Japan.  Hmm.
  Hmf.</p>

<p>Now I'm at home and have found that I can't study very well with
  Eminem blasting on my stereo.  Not so surprising I guess.</p>
