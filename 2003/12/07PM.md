<p>Saw <em>The Last Samurai</em> tonight.  I'm glad Tom and Taka
  didn't make out; that would have been a ruiner.  Pretty cool
  ending.  Saw it with Morag and her roommate Karen at World Porters
  in さくらぎちょう.</p>

<p>Today I rode my bike to work and took the train home (to the
  movies then home) so I'll get to ride it back tomorrow.  I hope the
  weather stays clear.</p>

<p>I'm hanging out slash calling みき too often to make it easy to not
  see her when janette comes.  Erg.  I think it will be easy enough
  for me but way unfair to her.</p>

<br>i salute you for thinking of how your actions will affect another. i am glad you can check your own desires out of kindness and consideration for another's welfare. that is the warrior part of you, ya?  and acting from kindness is good karma. things will work beautifully if you are wise and honest and kind.<br>
 i have to beleive that is true. <br>
