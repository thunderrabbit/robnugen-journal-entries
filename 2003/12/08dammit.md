<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>For some reason my journal seems to be fucking up when I start
  with the base URL /journal, which refreshes to
  /cgi-local/journal.pl (that refresh works okay, but) the refresh
  for which resolves to /cgi-local/journal.pl?date[latest_date] (this
  is the part that fucks up.)</p>

<p>But, if I just enter /cgi-local/journal.pl?date[latest_date], it's
  fine.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>Ah, cool.  It only fucks up with Safari (d'oh), and hopefully not
  most browsers.  My version of IE works okay.</p>
