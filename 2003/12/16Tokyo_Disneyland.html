<p>Yay no rain is scheduled for today!</p>

<p class=date>11:53pm</p>

<p>Whoo.</p>

<p>Tired.  tired.  My new roommate is so weird.</p>

<p>ともこ, ゆうこ and I had big fun at Tokyo Disneyland today.   I
  won't give a play by play; I'm too fucking tired for that.</p>

<p>My goldfinger got us permission to see the super show at the end
  of the day, but it was subsequently cancelled due to high winds.
  Silverfinger.</p>

<p>Space Mountain is closed due to some injury I guess.</p>

<p>Got a fastpass to ride Splash Mountain and then waited forty
  minutes for the Big Thunder Mountain minetrain.  That ride is well
  themed, has three lifts and lasts probably four minutes I'm
  guessing (including lifts).  The ride has little to no airtime, but
  the seats are quite loose with only one lapbar across two people at
  a time, giving plenty of wiggle room.  I could have stood up when I
  rode alone (but chose not to cause it was quite dark and I didn't
  want to risk a night in the hospital to prove I could do something
  I knew I could do) in the car, but instead just braced myself about
  8 inches off the seat for most of the ride.</p>

<p>We rode it twice.</p>

<p>Rode Splash Mountain twice as well.  It's half water half minetrain
  ride.  Actually 3/4 water.  I bought the picture the first time we
  rode.  That ride is (currently) themed with Brer Rabbit and friends
  Zip A Dee Doo Dah style with swampy critters playing banjos and
  singing and fishing.</p>

<p>We rode It's a Small World After All, a flat water ride going
  through different rooms with Disney's versions of different
  cultures' versions of Christmas.</p>

<p>Um, rode Star Tours, which was pretty good, but pretty short.  I
  was impressed with the themeing of that ride as well.  (original
  Star Wars trilogy theme) I couldn't tell how they made the ride
  move; we were basically in a moving box (I think!) but when we got
  out, it seemed pretty substantially connected to everything nearby.
  Interesting.</p>

<p>Oh, we went through a haunted house ride, and I was impressed with
  its ability to give large groups of people a show at a time.  3
  people per individually swiveling car, and we got on the cars while
  the train of cars was moving along the boarding area. Efficient and
  basically as safe as a moving sidewalk.  In the first elevator room,
  the pictures on the wall suddenly started stretching and it took me
  almost half a minute to see how that trick was done.  It looked
  really good. </p>

<p>We watched "Honey I Shrunk The Audience," which was pretty cute
  with quite realistic animation and included a huge dog sneezing on
  the entire audience.  (Sorry to give it away.) </p>

<p>Ate pizza at on a windy balcony area.  Yummy.</p>

<p>Ate 1700 yen dinner in a relatively nice restaurant.  After dinner
  we watched through the windows the Parade of Lights, featuring about
  15 Disney-themed floats, each coated in lights and starring
  animatronics, or (more often) people dressed as the characters from
  the various movies.  ともちゃん was able to more quickly and
  accurately identify the various stories/movies represented by the
  floats.</p>

<p>During dinner they gave me some Japanese to study and I gave some
  English to ゆうこね。</p>

<p>Oh, we rode the spinning tea cups only because I told them I would
  *not* spin it as fast as I could, but would in fact anti-rotate the
  cup so that we stayed oriented in the same direction through the
  entire ride.  That was nearly as fun and certainly required finer
  skills than spinning like Fred and I would have done.  Plus no one
  was sick afterward.</p>

<p>Took pictures in the Mad Hatter store (スーリやプオのきもの) and
  then bought some postcards in the overpriced gift shop.  I saw some
  slippers that I wanted to get for Wende.  I saw a plastic cookie tin
  that I wanted to get for janette.</p>

<p>I wondered a lot about what it would be like to work at TDL.  As a
  grounds sweeper (the place was really really clean (and, thank god,
  had very few smokers!)) or as an actor.  Could be fun.  Could be the
  start of my acting career.  (my what?)</p>

<p>Oh, we rode the Pirates of the Carribean ride, which ともこ said
  her uncle designed 20 years ago !!!!!  The ride has been here all
  this time and just recently re-themed in Pirates gear.  She said it
  was darker than before.  A baby cried while we were on the ride.</p>

<p>Overall, super fun time; I had great fun in the full attention of
  two women (as unavailable as we may all be) and learned a lot of
  Japanese and got to see TDL and laughed a ton; it was premium.</p>
