<p>今日はとうじです。</p>

<p>Today is winter solstice.  "Touji" in Japanese.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Yesterday work equaled okay.  A student asked if I would be a
  reference for him to volunteer overseas and I'd DEFINITELY do it,
  but I don't know him.  So I told him to ask his university English
  teacher but student said he (teacher) isn't available, and I
  encouraged him to pursue other routes to get to that teacher etc
  etc and stuff.</p>

<p>I checked the student's essay and made some changes, most notably
  the removal of "I love drinking!"</p>

<p>I was like, "I don't think that's the type of skills they're
  looking for in volunteers."</p>
