<p>I noticed my computer wasn't in my backpack, therefore decided I
  must not need to bring it to work today; it is rather heavy to carry
  around all the time, and I can't use it so much due to the battery
  suckage (don't get sidetracked don't get sidetracked) so, even
  though I'll have time between lesson and work, I'm not taking my
  computer; I'll just practice Japanese writing, not typing.</p>
