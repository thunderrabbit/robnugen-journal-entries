<p class=date>7:26am JST Thursday 1 January 2004</p>

<p>Really tired.  Fell asleep on each train home.  Yuuko didn't, so I
  didn't miss any stations on the way to Yokohama.  I had to watch for
  Tsunashima by myself, and I was successful.  Nice.  Oh shit I almost
  just fell asleep before I wrote nice; I was thinking about having to
  stay awake for the train and fell asleep thinking about staying
  awake.  Weird enough.</p>

<p>Okay, Happy New Year and good night.</p>
