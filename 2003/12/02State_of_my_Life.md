<p class=date>10:17am JST Tuesday 2 December 2003</p>

<p>This will be brief for now, but it's that time of the month for me.</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Masahiko (the guard/helper guy from the bank) is going to
    drive me to Nikko tomorrow!!  It was so random; the last time I
    saw him at the bank, he's like, 'what are your day off December?'
    and I cracked out my calendar and he said, "I pick you up
    Wednesday 3rd December."</p>

<p>"Cool; where will we go?"</p>

<p>"Nikko. I pick you up at 6am, okay?"</p>

<p>"Awesome!"</p>

<p>Just this morning he called to confirm.  It's really going to
  happen!  I wonder what kind of adventure this will be.</p></li>

<li><p>I am pretty much in love with Miki, and janette knows about her
    and his hanging tough knowing that I have fallen in and out of
    love in the past, and I really don't know anything about Miki
    really and it would take a lot more knowing for me before I do
    anything more with Miki.  It's a strange situation, yes.</p></li>

<li><p>This ding dong computer reallllly chows through
battery.</p></li>

<li><p>From 79% to 7% in the amount of time I've written this entry.
    And I don't hunt and peck.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm going to go look for an apartment today.  This is just the
    start of my search, but I am actually going to go out and look.
    I'll stop at the bank and ask Masahiko (when he called me this AM,
    he asked if I would come by and I said yes around 11am) to see if
    he can help me get started.</p></li>

<li><p>(interesting, it's still at 7%; it seems to be highly
miscalibrated)</p></li>


<li><p>I'm considering the possibility of buying food to cook at my
    house because it would be less expensive monetarily (if more
    expensive timeily) and because it seems like a good skill to
    develop again.  Plus during the Nova holidays (27 Dec - 3 Jan) I
    should have time to cook and I don't know what convenience store
    hours will be.  Does *everything* *really* shut down?  I dunno.  I
    doubt it; sounds more like hype, but Japan is quirky.</p></li>
