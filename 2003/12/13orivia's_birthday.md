<p class=date>1:09am JST Sunday 14 December 2003</p>

<p>Today Olivia invited me to her birthday party in 綱島.  The timing
  was convenient for me so I came to the designated restaurant and
  saw a couple of gaijin there and was like, "hey do you know
  Olivia?" and they're like, "no" but I know one of the cats and he
  remembers me from working at Kawasaki and then he's like, "Oh,
  Olivia; yeah I met her, but we haven't seen any other gaijin
  here."  Turns out Olivia was downstairs with some peeps and I don't
  know how it all happened but they had just arrived kinda</p>

<p>ANYWAY I hung out with Phillip, Sarah & Kristen (roommates) for a
  while, chatted with them some.  Phillip is from New York; Sarah is
  from Christchurch (NZ), and Kristen is from Melbourne (OZ).  <!
  Sarah is engaged, but was quite touchy-feely with Phillip it seemed,
  so that was a bit weird to me. > We chatted, chowed a bit and
  laughed and I traded phone numbers with Sarah who invited me to hang
  with them for New Year's party.  We shall see.</p>

<p>Went down to Olivia's thing and found Morag & Karen (roommates),
  Olivia & Jen & Grace (roommates), Nina (?), あいこ(student), Lubo
  (me, Jen, Grace, Olivia's building), and かしひろ(?)  (some other
  Japanese guy that Olivia seemed to like a lot).  They had smuggled
  in some vodka and Olivia took a huge shot (2 ounces) and then
  offered shots to anyone within reach.  I had a sip and O and J were
  really happy about that.  (Oh, they've taken to calling me Robehts,
  with emphasis on the last syllable.)  Morag and I made "oh my gosh
  they are so drunking weird!" eyes at each other several times.  It
  was funny.</p>

<p>Turns out it is not Olivia's birthday.</p>
