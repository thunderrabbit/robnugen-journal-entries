<p class=date>8:35am JST Thursday 25 December 2003</p>

<p>Have spent time sending emails this morning.  Including to Marta
  who would like to make peace with me.  I replied yes I'd like to,
  but I can't right now.</p>

<p>I'm glad she and Fred are doing cool stuff together (hosting
  advisor weekend type stuff)</p>

<p>I made the first step toward getting a counselor.  I asked Morag
  to bring to work the Volunteer Directory that N H-Y gave to me when
  I was interested in forming a warrior network in Japan.  Now I need
  the network for myself.  Not for Japan.</p>

<p>going to meditate for a bit then get ready for work.</p>
