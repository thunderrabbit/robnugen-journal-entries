<p>Today at work I worked really deliberately to learn all my
  students' names.  First class was a no show.  Second class I had
  four students.  こうじ, みどり, ともみ, and あすこ。  Third class
  was a guy named something wtih two t's like Attio and a guy whose
  folder is pink and he's named Watanabe or something.  Then a guy
  named としゆき, and then I had my break.</p>

<p>I was the first teacher to teach voice today, and there were three
  students: まゆき, きょうこ, and (another) こうじ。 Sixth class has
  escaped my brain. Seventh class was level three いくみ and eighth
  class was a kid named...  something. </p>

<p>So, in all, a great success rate for learning names today!</p>
