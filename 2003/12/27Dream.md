<p class=date>9:29am JST Saturday 27 December 2003</p>

<p class=dream>I was a spy and was asked to sneak into a small room
  and use a power drill with a grinder bit to cut a power cable to
  the building.  The room had a glass window and a bad guy was
  cleaning the window from the other side with a power sprayer. I
  wondered if, like in a movie, he would cover the window with suds,
  just allowing me to cut the calbe before he saw me.</p>

<p class=dream>He didn't cover the entire window, and the room started
  to move.  Oh, the room was white and I was wearing a black body
  suit, though he still didn't see me.  The room started to move a
  bit, making it difficult for me to freeze myself (in an
  uncomfortable position to make it look like I must be dead (or
  sleeping)) against one corner, but that's what I did.</p>

<p class=dream>He continued to not see me, but (Mike's) high school
  Miki came up and she saw me from the bad guy's side of the window.
  She came into the room and I began to actually fall asleep, which I
  didn't exactly want to do cause I wanted to stay aware of the
  situation, and she came up to me and I figured she was my friend and
  wanted to help so I was like, "distract that guy" or "turn off the
  lights" or something and she ignored me or didn't understand or had
  her own objectives.</p>

<p class=dream>She got really close and gave me a kiss on the cheek
  and the guy noticed now and he started to chase me.  I knew I could
  fly so I flew horizontally down the hallway (*) and then up through
  the roof of the building so I was outside flying among the trees
  above a garden party with a lot of well dressed bad guys (men and
  wonmen) discussing whatever bad guys discuss at garden parties.</p>

<p class=dream>I was being chased by more people who could fly, so
  when they came up to my level, I launched myself up higher than they
  could fly.  (haha beat that, suckas!) and then HS Miki came up to me
  and we and I told her I love her and we started kissing.</p>

<p class=dream>Told her that I want to marry her and she was like,
  "cool," and our friends were like, "okay, take these [marriage
  licenses (that looked like drivers licenses)] that we forged before
  and put them in your wallet."  So we weren't actually married, but
  we could claim we were; we had the documents to prove it.</p>

<p class=dream>We were then free of the bad guys and I was walking
  alone down Methil street (**) and saw Suzanne with some kids she was
  babysitting.  She was dropping them off to someone else, so she had
  some free time.  We were in an S&M bar and I gave her a huge
  spanking, though I couldn't quite get the right [smack], and it was
  more like just hitting her with my palm.  No [crack!] of a good
  swat.</p>

<p class=dream>She was still happy with them and we walked out, "thank
  you; see you later," and we were walking and saw Neil and Ryan
  walking to work.  Neil was on his cell phone saying, "I'm going to
  work now, yeah in Shibuya" and I was like, "did you hear him say
  Shibuya?" to Suzanne, wondering if she could understand the language
  here in Japan.  (he was speaking in English)</p>

<p>Woke up two minutes before my alarm went off.</p>

<p>(*) quite lucid if I can fly horizontally; usually up is all I can
manage.</p>
