<p class=date>2:09am JST Sunday 21 December 2003</p>

<p>Slept for 2 hours and then Dan turned on his music real loud
  (good-ish dance music, though the player skipped occasionally) and
  woke me up with that and clanging around in the kitchen.  Orivia and
  Jen came down and then Jen left and then <em>Lord of the Rings
  2</em> went into the VCR.</p>

<p>I slept-ish through a lot of this, but decided I'd like to watch
  the movie and got up for it.  They had no idea I was home already
  and were apologetic.  No worries, mates.</p>

<p>Jen, Grace, and あいこ came back near the end of the movie and
  watched the rest of it.  Orivia and I read some of the subtitles and
  had them confirmed by あいこ.  Nice.</p>
