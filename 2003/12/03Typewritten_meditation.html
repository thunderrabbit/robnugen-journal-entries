<p>The best of both worlds.</p>

<pre>
somewhere there is an answer

it might not be the right answer but

it's possible that I am not being given guidance for what I'm supposed
to do in the world; maybe I asked specifically for no guidance.  maybe
for reasons I don't know, no guidance can be given.

Maybe I'm asking the wrong questions.

Anyone who is in their right mind cannot know what they are to do in
the world.

People occasionally slip out of their mind and peek, but this is more
the exception than the rule.

I can't explain in English why this is true.

It's possible that no matter where I go, I will be able to figure out
something cool to do.

let's assume this, which means it doesn't matter where I go.   And
therefore it doesn't matter what I do or what kids I have or who I
marry or anything else.

this reminds me of Ram Dass.

Let's say that the

after this entry, write to Rebecca.  Find emails for her and write
her. (*)

let's say that the palm reader guy was wrong about one thing: that my
job is to not become attached to anything until I find the right
thing.  This would look like me not know what is the right thing, but
each thing has equal potential of, actually, each thing is the right
thing in its (my) own way.

"What has the gene pool gained by having a guy float around and decide
everything is not good enough to do?"

So if I grant myself the belief that if I get married, I won't be
missing my Life Ship, will I let myself get married?  

(um, no)

Then what is it?

Fear of something unknown.

Why do you think you even want to get married?

(mirror:)  Because if I get married, then I've found someone that I
can trust enough with my everything forever.  But really that means I
trust myself.  Mirror.

Ah.  Very interesting.  How will you know if you trust yourself?

Ummmmmmm.

<p>Sidetracked.  My glasses</p>

<p>Oh, this is interesting.   I have noticed recently my ability to
  mis-align priorities.  Like the time I was like, Self, you march
  yourself right up there and talk to the apartment guy.  Just do
  it.  And I walked up there and he spoke zip-nothing of English and
  I'm like, "fuck" and told him I'd call a friend.  Called Liz and
  she's like cool, and I was focused on getting her to come to the
  apartment locator place, where I was.  Trying to describe this was
  going to be a nightmare, but I was stuck on optimizing her time so
  that she would be able to get good time on her own project (me
  writing her speech (shit I'm meeting her again tomorrow (**))) and
  I didn't think of the option of having her meet me at the station.
  It's a known location, and it was a short walk from the apartment
  place. Well, a 3 minute walk.   (I was, at least, smart enough to
  disallow her to meet me at my apartment which would have been
  ridiculous (15 minute walk). yay for that.)</p>

<p>okay, my glasses are dirty I noticed and I'm like, "aight take a
  shower" (that's called an extended remix glasses cleaning, jeez)
  cause I'm like aight I'm supposed to call janette in 23 minutes; I
  can *barely* take a shower in that amount of time = rush rush rush
  rush rush; gotta get away from that.</p>

<p>(*) found one email.  It bounced.</p>

<p>(**) fuck, even though I knew my schedule would be tight, I oh
  dammit and i haven't done my laundry this weekend.  FUCK!</p>
