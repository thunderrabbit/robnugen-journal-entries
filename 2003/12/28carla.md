<p>I'm on the couch at Carla's (and whaddya know it looks like I've
  got an internet signal) after watching _The Piano_ and then
  tallllking talking talking about life the universe and what we're
  doing in it.</p>

<p>"What's money?"  (just plan and do whatever you want to do; don't
  worry about the money)</p>

<p>"Savor the moment"  (I am right here in Japan <em>IN JAPAN</em>
  and I have Carla (whose brain I love) all to myself and I choose to
  savor this moment)</p>

<p>"Just say HI" (force yourself to say HI to the new people who come
  to work until it comes naturally)</p>

<p>I asked Carla specifically what her issues are.  It was good to
  hear that she has some.</p>

<p>This is the night Dan didn't take his key and locked himself out
  and came here to borrow my key.</p>

<p>Also the night that we saw 6 cop cars, 7 cop motorcycles, (a
  baker's dozen cops,) a crowd of people on the street down from
  Carla's apartment.  We couldn't tell what was quite so interesting.</p>

<p>Also the night that we saw some guys carrying flashlights and
  hitting sticks together in some kind of nighttime (end of year?)
  flashlight carrying stick hitting ceremony.</p>

<p>I specifically asked Carla for a hug as we said good night.
  "You're a good person," she told me.  <em>thank you for telling
  me</em> "you are, too."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>As the movie ended, it was 11:30 and trains were still running so
  I could go home.  But I wanted to stay at Carla's tonight.  So I
  could talk with her.  But part of my brain was caught up in the
  naughtiness of wanting to stay at Carla's that I couldn't think of
  anything to talk about with her.  Finally I overcame it and we
  talked about all the good stuff mentioned above.</p>

<p>I believe there is a balance between falling in love with my life
  as it is, and seeking things in my life to help me fall in love
  with my life.  I want to fall in love with life with someone
  (partner) to share it with.  And I want to do my own thing on my
  own schedule.</p>

<p>I was willing to spend the money to come watch a movie with Carla,
 but I wouldn't have spent the money on a movie for myself.  There's a
 lesson underneath that as well.  I was willing to go to Hawaii with
 janette, but less willing to spend the money to go to ____ (Egypt,
 Viet Nam, Singapore) alone.</p>

<p>There's a balance between not going into debt to do the things I
  want, and not doing the things I want until I can "afford" to do
  them.</p>

<p>I don't often want to be not the last person to leave the party
  because I don't want to miss anything, and I don't want to let
  anyone down.  I had to consciously realize that it was okay for me
  to leave Houston; I didn't need to ask for permission.  I seem to
  want permission to take care of myself.</p>
