<p>Tonight Morag and I went to Starbucks to study.  We really really
  had fun!!  We've scheduled to do it again next Friday.</p>

<p>I wrote:</p>

<pre>
金ようびスターバクスに行った。　たくさんの人はいた。　
たくさんの人はよんだ。　ほかの人は食べて話さった。
それモラグと勉強した。　ホトーココアを飲んだ。
金曜日に新しコト買った。
</pre>

<p>I see that the last three characters should actually be four
  characters: を買った。 But it's a pretty good set of sentences for
  me.  I'm going to email it to あやな for correction.</p>

<br>ouououo i do not like that my computer will not correctly print japanese. the kanji seems to come thru but the other symbols are mostly dots or dashes. <br>
 are you tricking us by writing japanese in morse code!!??<br>
 i asked you to read your sentences and then i rambled on and did not get to hear them. rats. <br>
 good work,mate, on having fun and learning japanese.
