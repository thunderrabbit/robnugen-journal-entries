<p class=date>1:00am JST Thursday 25 December 2003</p>

<p>I'm in a fucking pissed off mood now after talking to janette and
  bringing to light the issues of the evening which is I love too many
  women and just want to have the comfort of women who love me to be
  around me and I don't want to go to counciling and I hate everything
  that has to do with not having women gush over me all the time and I
  sure as fuck don't want to do any couciling in Japan and everyone
  can just bite me and fuck off.</p>

<p>Yes, ma, there is a lot of anger in me.  Where the fuck did it
  come from I don't know but punching plastic bottles full of water
  didn't get rid of all of it.  Just hurt my hands a little bit,
  fortunately not my wrist any more than it already is.</p>

<p>I hate writing in my journal every day I hate not having a big
  project to pour my heart and soul into I hate not knowing what the
  fuck I'm supposed to be doing in the world and I hate thinking that
  the right answer is within my heart somewhere and all I have to do
  is ask for it and it will come.  No, I hate knowing that apparently
  I'm not ready to know the answer.  Matrix kinda shit, the choice has
  been made and we just have to understand the reason for the
  choice.</p>

<p>I hate that I pour my heart into my journal everyday and I get
  nothing from it.  I hate thinking that I get nothing from it.  I
  hate thinking that the something should be in the form of cash sent
  to my paypal account.</p>

<p>I'm thankful that my mom sent me cash for Christmas (to my papal
  account).</p>

<p>"it has become apparent that I need to find a counselor in Japan.
  I can easily find a hundred excuses and difficulties in finding a
  counselor.  I just need to set aside my drug of choice (women) for
  long enough (and not just rot in my room like I did yesterday) to
  find a counselor and then to trust that every week it's worth my
  time to go to that counselor each week consistently (the way I go to
  Japanese lesson)."</p>

<p>I've got to let you go to take care of myself.  (and punch some
  water bottles and bang out this journal entry and brush my teeth
  and cry in bed.)</p>

<p>Tomorrow the drug is in the form of a party at Carla's house.
  Friday the drug is Miki and other students and teachers at Wara
  Wara.  Saturday the drug is going out with Miki and Dan and the
  girls upstairs.  Sunday I curl up and die. But I won't physically
  die; don't worry.</p>

<p>I persevere.</p>
