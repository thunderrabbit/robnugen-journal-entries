<p>I kissed Yuuko (no tongue) a few times. On different occassions
  throughout our time together "tonight."  Most recently on the train
  platform in Shin-something station (the end of the seaside line),
  she was on my lap with our cheeks touching close close and then she
  said, "big kiss" and I was like, "mm?" and she goes, "big kiss" and
  we mashed lips together, and it must have felt pretty good cause we
  did it again immediately.</p>

<p>She was like, "haha two big kisses."</p>

<p>I wouldn't call them big kisses, but they were definitely kisses.</p>

<p>The previous (first) time was while waiting in line for the third
  riding of Surf Coaster.  I was spooned behind her with my hands with
  her hands in her jacket pockets and I took a big bite on both of her
  ears and then cheeks close together and then, somewhat awkwardly,
  our first kiss.  Then another, almost as awkward.  I was like,
  "sorry," and "I shouldn't kiss you," and she was like, "it's
  okay."</p>
