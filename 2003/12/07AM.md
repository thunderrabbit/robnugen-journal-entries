<p class=date>8:18am JST Sunday 7 December 2003</p>

<p>Long sleep sure feels yummy.</p>

<p>Morag got my message around midnight; says her phone has been
  screwing up.</p>

<p>I was sleepin' when she emailed me and too tired to reply, so I
  fell back asleep after the phone woke me up.  In my sleep I wondered
  what time she texted me and I kept checking my phone but I couldn't
  figure out how to use it.  Of course I was checking some complicated
  dream phone or maybe my phone but without my physical body.</p>

<p>Still don't know my password.  Maybe my grammatically correct
  query didn't make sense.</p>

David     Ok. I reset it.
