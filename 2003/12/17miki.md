<p class=date>12:21am JST Thursday 18 December 2003</p>

<p>We chowed at the ramen place on the corner of the buildings next to
  Gera Gera and then zoomed back to Kawasaki and sat in Starbucks for
  a bit before her flute lesson.  I got kicked out of Starbucks for
  not buying anything after a while and roamed around looking for a
  Vodafone shop to see if they'll replace my phone which got fucked up
  in my umbrella enabled bicycle dismount today.  *That*'s what
  bruised the crap out of my leg.</p>

<p>We sat (and I slept) a bit after getting some contraband food from
  the convenience store and then rocked into the movie.</p>

<p>After the movie, there were a lot of girls (and a few guys)
  wearing total goth clothes, with huge black tall high heels.  I
  wondered who the show could have been for - certainly not anyone
  that I've heard of (though I secretly wondered if I would be
  disappointed to find out who)...  it's a little band called Moi dix
  Mois.  I ain't never heard of them, but they's apparently a bit
  popular (at least in Japan) right about now.</p>

<p>Some of the outfits were rather cute, but man what a nightmare for
  walking in those shoes!</p>

<p>Walked Miki to her bus and went home.</p>
