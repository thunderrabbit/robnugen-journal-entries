<p>I just felt like calling this entry Honk.</p>

<p>I just read a 9 page article about video games as a new huge
  market that will begin to drive the movie industry.</p>

<p>Today I was walking alongside my fellow travelers and realized that
  I'm in this sea of humanity and wondered about the idea that we
  (humans) are each just focal points of emotions and we can draw to
  us positive love energy or negative fear energy.  Just by "thinking"
  (*) about it, or "focusing" (*) on such energies.</p>

<p>Like we're each little radios that can choose which frequencies of
  universal energy we choose to pick up.  What if we simply choose to
  allow the positive love energy of the universe to work through us?
  That's my choice; just walk around and act in loving ways all the
  time.</p>

<p>So what does that mean if I'm just a magnifying glass for certain
  energies of my choosing?  Maybe it means the secret to a happy
  healthy beautiful life is just to believe that we are living such a
  life.  That matches things that I "believe" (*) so far in the
  world.. that we create reality by thinking and we choose our own
  experiences whether consciously or not.</p>

<p>finish.  arigato.</p>

<p>(*) whatever these words mean.</p>
