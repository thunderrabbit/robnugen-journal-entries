<p>Talked with janette for about an hour; described to her (oh shit I
  wonder if this will become a large "sidetrack" to my day) what I had
  just recently read about <a
  href="http://www.theharrowgroup.com/articles/20031222/20031222.htm#_Toc59533105">computing
  technology</a> and changes that will need to be made before
  TIPS can be harnessed effectively.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>Sidetrack avoided.  I'm not going to try and solve this bottleneck
  right now.</p>

<p>I am going to fuck with my website though.</p>
