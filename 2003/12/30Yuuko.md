<p>裕子 and I met at Starbucks in Cinecitta and then zoomed over to
  Shibuya to sit in Harajuku for a bit.  Watched the bicycle guys, but
  they weren't as good as the time janette and I watched that one cat
  a long time ago.</p>

<p>Walked down おもてさんどう street, which I've been down before, but
  didn't know the name of it.  Found a subway and headed toward Tokyo
  station to check out ミレナリオ (mirenario) a big light show thing
  that is pretty anticlimatic, but is basically pretty.  Not quite as
  good vibes as the lights on West Gray, but still pretty good.  What
  was REALLY amazing though was the Japanese crowds packed so tightly
  that we couldn't really walk with full steps and couldn't easily
  walk side by side; we kept getting mushed by the crowd.  Tens of
  thousands of people crowded these few blocks and thousands all had
  their camera phones in the air, taking little piece of crap pictures
  to basically just, I dunno; prove that they had been there, but not
  only to someone who knew what they were looking at.</p>

<p>Insanity.</p>

<p>And cold, so we came to a Starbucks here in this rather fancy
  shmancy district.  Does Starbucks have a frequent flyer card?  Not a
  debit card, but a free stuff after multi purchase card.</p>

<p>We walked around Roppongi (my first time to be there), the
  expensive night-lifeful area that I thought would have a lot of
  drunken revelry, but was pretty chill and beautiful.  The most
  awesome fun thing was sitting on a glass chair <! and Yuuko sitting
  in my lap> reading the somewhat random numbers that were being
  displayed on a wall.  Three large digits that would each
  independently count from 9 down to 1 and then blank (which I used as
  a zero) and I would pronounce the number in Japanese each time a
  digit changed.</p>

<p>Fun fun stuff.</p>

<p>Rode my bike home in 30 minutes.  Cold cold cold.  Home around
  11:30, bed around 12:30.</p>
