<p class=date>7:35pm JST Wednesday 3 December 2003</p>

<p>I remember him saying it would take about 2 or 3 hours to drive to
  Æü¸÷¡£ Fair enough.  That's how long it took the tour bus.</p>

<p>It took 6 hours each way.</p>

<p>Mate.  Six hours.</p>

<p>We were <em>in</em> Nikko approximately 1 hour.  We saw a waterfall
  I had never seen, (uh oh, deja vu is happening), the waterfall we
  saw through clouds on the tour (no clouds this time), and the temple
  we saw on the tour (no rain this time).</p>

<p>I did get pictures.</p>

<p>My god what a long day of driving, and so many beautiful places to
  stop, but we just drove drove drove.</p>

<p>Traffic was a nightmare.  We drove through little-ass cities, each
  with fifty lights in a row, non-synchronized, single lanes with a
  jillion fuckin' people trying to get through.</p>

<p>And, I had to <em>peeeeeeeee</em>.</p>

<p>AND, though I didn't turn on my computer today, it went from 100%
  to 49% battery during our 13 hours.  Now it's down to 17% battery in
  the, let's see, 6 minutes it's taken me to write this entry.</p>

<p>Six minutes?  Well, not flat out typing; I'm writing this as I go
  blah blabh whatthefuck ever</p>

<p>I'm on the train, have 12% battery and that's maybe enough to
  describe all the thoughts I thunk while ridin' around crowded rural
  Japan.</p>

<br>Sorry it took so long to get to Nikko. Maybe the tour bus used the expensive toll roads.<br>
<br>
I'll send you a few pictures from our time together.<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
