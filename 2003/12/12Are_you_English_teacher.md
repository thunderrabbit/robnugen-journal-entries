<p class=date>8:49am JST Friday 12 December 2003</p>

<p>Got to Starbucks around 7:30am and have had just the snottiest nose
  ever.  All clear snot, so it's not contageous; it's just allergies.
  janette (I think!) called my cellie a moment ago and I tried to zip
  outside to talk to her (bad reception upstairs here in SB) and she
  was all, "if you can hear me, call me back if you can," and hung up
  just as I was outside.  D'oh!  So I emailed her back and wonder if
  she'll call me again.</p>

<p>As I came back inside, I bought another ホトココア and the cashier
  was all, "are you. English. teacher?"</p>

<p>I'm like, "はい、" and then "毎しゅうここに"</p>

<p>And she goes, "I know," thinking she knew that I was saying I come
  here every week.</p>

<p>But I continued, "。。。日本語を勉強します。"</p>

<p>And she's like, "oh.　私もここに英語を勉強します。"</p>

<p>"ほんと？"</p>

<p>"でも、ぜんぜん英語をはなします。"  (*)</p>

<p>(*) I think this is the conjugation she used.</p>

<p>And I was like, <em>oops; I don't know what to say,</em> so I just
  made an "eeeeek" face like, "yikes stripes."</p>

<p>Wow, janette was right; I can become a regular somewhere and make
  friends that way.  It's only taken 6 months.  ;-)</p>
