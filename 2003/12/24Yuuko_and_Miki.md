<p>Met 裕子 at Cinecitta.  We ate at Freshness Burger where I told her
  in the best Japanese I could muster the story of the movie Changing
  Lanes then came to my house to watch Changing Lanes.</p>

<p>The story was a bit difficult or uninteresting for her to follow,
  so we didn't make it much past the middle.  Looked through the pics
  on my computer instead.  There's over 3000 pictures so we didn't
  make it to the middle before I had to go back to Cinecitta to meet
  Haneda Miki (not KG Miki).  On the way back I was a bit distracted
  with monitoring my emotional etc internal senses, wondering slash
  noticing how dis/similar that was to having two girlfriends and
  watching as I wrangled with ditching one for the other and which one
  and what if we were all just friends which we officially are, and
  Haneda Miki is off my list anyway cause she smokes, but I felt like
  I owed her dinner cause she paid for mine some time ago etc etc
  etc.</p>

<p>8 minutes late to meet Miki and I couldn't tell if she was upset
  (it's a challenge for me to read Japanese poker faces) at me being
  late or at Yuuko being there too, or not upset at all.  gah</p>

<p>Went to a kaitein sushi, which was Miki's first time to visit and I
  was intrigued by what seeeemed to be a switch thrown on the kaitein
  sushi track, cause when we were invited to our seats, there were no
  sushis in front of us on the moving conveyor, but then some began to
  appear and it was all one big conveyor linked with the other parts
  of the bar, which did have sushi before.</p>

<p>Ate, then went to see Bad Boys II at Cinecitta after we wandered
  around the game center and ended up not going to the プリクラ to get
  pictures taken (cause it was too crowded).  Bad Boys II was
  surprisingly long and had lots of killer diller car chases and
  shootemups and I'm like dammmmn what is the budget for this
  movie?</p>
