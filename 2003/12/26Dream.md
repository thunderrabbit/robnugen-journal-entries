<p class=date>11:12am JST Friday 26 December 2003</p>

<p class=dream>I was masturbating in my room and realized that people
  outside behind me could see me so I stopped and turned around.
  They were peeking out their windows, and looked like they hadn't
  seen me, but then one guy does a jackoff motion question mark and
  I (in a cheerful way) gave them the finger.  "haha fuck you for
  looking" kinda thing.</p>

<p class=dream>One of the guys came outside and was talking to me and
  then dreamshift and I was watching this bird slash friend eat
  seeds, but he couldn't pick up a certain seed with his beak so he
  cocked his head over to pick it up with his <b>eye</b> using
  adhesion from his tears (*)</p>

<p class=dream>I was like, "hey um, Mr bird, what name can we humans
  call you?"</p>

<p class=dream>He was like, "Poppyseed"</p>

<p class=dream>"Poppyseed, did you just pick up that seed with your eye??"</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah blah blah blah..." some explanation he gave made perfect
  sense to us.</p>

<p class=dream>Wow; cool.  We had a newfound respect for the nature of
birds.</p>

<p>(*) not tears, but ambient eye moisture.  Is there a word for that?</p>


<p class=dream>Dreamshift and then we were with Samuel L Jackson who
  was doing fung shi on his new house that was rather huge.  I helped
  him walk around the perimeter and seal it with a symbolic fan of
  some sort.</p>
