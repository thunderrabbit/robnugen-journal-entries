<p>The old idea was to save Japan from itself.  Fuck Japan. (*) I need
  this for myself.</p>

<p>The new idea: start going to 12 step meetings for myself.  Start
  with AA, which I know exists in abundance in Tokyo, and see if
  there exists the 12 step meeting that I need.  I wonder if I can
  start that meeting.</p>

<p>(What happened to riding roller coasters?  I seem to only see one
  thing at a time and throw all my energy into it.  _Rob's Roller
  Coaster Roundup_, janette, Miki, study Japanese, clean my room, 12
  step meetings, work)</p>

<p>(*) Let Japan live at it has.  From Jon:</p>

<pre>I don't know when you wrote this, maybe it was early, but by now
you may know that Japan has a long history with Americans trying to
change Japanese culture, starting with Admiral Perry in the mid 19th
Century. They have succesfully resisted missionaries (the Koreans
became Presbyterians almost overnight) and total occupation and an
imposition of a constitution upon them by the United States. But the
underlying core of their culture is intact, based on their warrior
code, which dates back to the 13th century.</pre>
