<p class=date>1:22am JST Sunday 14 December 2003</p>

<p>At work, near the end of the day, a student was all, "HI" to me and
  I'm like, <em>you look familiar, but I've not seen you in a long
  time, ummmmmm,</em> "I'm sorry; I don't remember your name."</p>

<p>"ゆうこ。"</p>

<p>I still didn't remember it.   "Oh!  It's been a really long time
  since I've seen you!"</p>

<p>"Yes yes yeah do you know ともこ?"</p>

<p><em>Tomoko with whom I'm going to TDL on Tuesday? Don't get me in
    trouble here, please.</em> "Yeah, ともこ, yeah."</p>

<p>She did this to verify I was the right Rob.  On her phone she
  showed me an email I had written to Tomoko saying "I look forward
  to going to TDL with you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, are you going??"</p>

<p>"Yes yes."</p>

<p>"Awesome!"</p>

<p>Turns out she was in my next lesson with みほ and a different ともこ。
  Funny.</p>
