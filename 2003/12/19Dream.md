<p class=date>7:24am JST Friday 19 December 2003</p>

<p class=dream>I was coloring a picture of three chefs in a coloring
  book.  Just systematically slowing filling the shapes with color,
  being careful not to go outside the lines, gently slowly filling in
  all the nooks and crannies.</p>

<p class=dream>I was with a male friend of mine, working on this
  little project with him.  In the background a rock band was playing
  covers of loud 80s rock bands, kinda one step down in loudness from
  glam rock.  My friend was then cleaning up some wax and talking to
  it like, "I don't have time for this; I don't care if you are my
  girlfriend; I gotta go."</p>

<p>And I'm like, "wha?!" and woke up because I gotta go to Japanese
  lesson!</p>
