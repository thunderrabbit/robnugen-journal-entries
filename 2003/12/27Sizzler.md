<p>Wow.  I'm in Odaiba with Carla, Kaori, Mamiko, Benny, Melanie, and
  Clayton.  Eating buffet (actually I'm eating just calamari cause
  I'm going to a buffet tonight).</p>

<p>The mood music, here in Sizzler, a family steak restaurant with
  kids and moms and dads and us, is NIN "closer."</p>

<p>No, it's not censored.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We saw the Korean drug ship ちょうりょう (Chyorio) that got sunk by
  the Japanese and the Korean government said, "hey man that ship
  wasn't a drug ship."</p>

<p>So the Japanese then recovered it and found all this proof that it
  was a drug ship.  It's now on display.</p>

<p>D'oh.  Due to my silly battery, I won't be able to write again
  after I close this, but hey.  I gotta eat.</p>

<p>of note: Carla and Benny indicated that being the leader all the
  time is not all it's cracked up to be. (I can tell I'm sleepy).</p>
