<p>For some reason my phone is locked and the code to unlock it is
  not the code it used to be.  I don't know how it got locked; the
  phone was not turned off (I didn't turn it on when I found it
  locked) blah blah blah.  So I'll go to vodafone to get it unlocked;
  I hope they are open today!</p>

<p>Yay.  They were open.  Got the number recovered; it was 3873.  I
  thought it was 3673.  Hmmm.  I don't usually forget such things.</p>
