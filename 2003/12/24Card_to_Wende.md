<p>Just wrote a card to send to Wende, but it took a while cause I
  put some Pooh magnets and a chocolate coin in between two cards and
  on the front of the card it says</p>

<pre>
Happy Christmas and the
like!  I Hope your holidays
rule and that you get
to have the best elfa
sale experience EVER and
that your family is great
and Peter, Tinkerbell and that
other cat are great and
that you like the chocolate
and longer lasting Pooh magnets
</pre>

<p>At which point I realized when she reads the card she won't have
  seen the magnets and it would spoil the surprise.  So, I added a
  sticky flap that says CENSORED UNTIL PACKAGE IS OPENED, but it took
  two point five tries to get it right.</p>

<p>Maybe this is why I'm loathe to send things; each one must be Aries
  calibre greatest thing <em>ever</em>.</p>

<p>Leaving now to send the card, buy some raw spinach, eat it (and
  maybe eat some non-raw eggs) and then meet ¤æ¤¦¤³ in Kawasaki.</p>

<br>I can relate. I read a letter 1000 times before I send it. And I would say something like "oh don't worry about what you write, people already think you are the greatest" but they would just be words. I mean, blah blah. perfectionism is cool<br>
