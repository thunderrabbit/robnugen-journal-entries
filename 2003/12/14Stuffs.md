<p>I've realized that I'm enjoying work more as I get to know the
  students.  As I learn their names.  I memorized ともひろ and ひとみ's　
  names today.  It helped also when I kinda joked around with them
  and said, "どぞ" (please [speak]) to Tomohiro when he and I spoke at the
  same time.</p>

<p>It's like I'm gravitating more toward Ali's style of teaching; he
  seems to know a ton of students names and allows the classes to be
  fun and not necessarily serious.  I am beginning to let myself go a
  bit in that respect.</p>

<p>Some of the shit he says makes no sense; it's just him being
  silly.</p>

<p>Gave LU to a guy (ironically whose name I have forgotten) at the
  last lesson of the day.  7B to 7A.</p>

<p>Chose not to give my contact info to ゆみこ, even though had I had
  the identical lesson with her two months ago, I would have.  Less
  desperate for Japanese friends now.</p>

<p>Surfed internet for 3 hours instead of studying tonight.</p>

<p>d'oh.</p>

<p>Payday is in one hour and 25 minutes.</p>

<p>ゆみ has contacted me asking me to teach her again at Gateway 21.
  Sweet!  All of my private students have dropped off the map.  She's
  the first to hook it up again.</p>
