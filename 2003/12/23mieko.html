<p>In the middle of the movie, I got an email from Mieko, "I'm in
  Kawasaki; where should I wait for you?" because I had emailed her
  earlier, 今晩、食べませんか。 (you wanna chow tonight?)  And I was
  like "oh fuck" cause it seemed strange to have invited her to eat
  and then gotten food myself (but she didn't reply immediately;
  obviously it took more than 1 hour cause we had watched half the
  movie and it took me 20 minutes to go <em>get</em> my food)..</p>

<p>Blah blah blah, we met and had a fun time though all the stores
  were closed and the first kaitein sushi place was not a sushi place
  at all, and we left after only the appetizers (story is being
  adjusted for cultural differences; I don't have the language to
  explain it succinctly either in English or Japanese) and she paid.
  Got hot cocoa and tea at Starbucks and I paid and then we chilled on
  the steps between Azalea and 川崎 station and just chatted.</p>

<p>I think our friendship will survive the miscommunication due to my
  inviting her to eat and then eating alone; we had fun.</p>
