<p>It almost seems like every day I wake up smoothly just seconds
  before my alarm goes off.  I'm really thankful for that.</p>

<br>Yeah, I wake up at 6:59 these days and my alarm usually goes off at 7. How do our bodies and minds DO that?! It's definitely something to be thankful for. It eases the alarm buzzer shell shock.
