<p>今、優彦さん　(まさひこ) のいえにいます。</p>

<p>I really like his wife's spoken Japanese; I don't know if she
  speaks more clearly or if I am suddenly understanding more, but it
  seems that I can pick up more of her spoken words than other
  peoples'.</p>

<p>Ummmmm we took the train to his house (over an hour from 綱島) and
  he cooked a rockin' dinner!  janette *totally* would love this; the
  house is full of quirky stuff and not at all like a stuffy clean
  house that I thought most (but what the heck do I know, this is the
  first Japanese home I've been to) Japanese homes might be.  Anyway,
  I totally want janette to come visit Masahiko's house and have him
  cook for her and me; that will rule.</p>

<p>Watched two western movies each starring James Dean, whose voice is
  nothing like I thought it would be (I expected Elvis, and I found it
  squeaky and Texan twangy), East of Eden and Giants (?) I think.</p>

<p>Anyway, mostly my mind has been on what</p>

<p>(( oh, tonight was my first bath in a Japanese home; wash wash
  wash in the shower and then galooosh (gently) into the HOT water
  and soak until my heart was like, "hey jack, this is too hot" and I
  got out.  Nice, but chotto hot for me ))</p>

<p>the hell I'm doing in Japan and what the hell I'm doing in the
  world.  In my mind I have begun to compose a theory that I can never
  settle down with one *anything* be it home, country, relationship,
  job, project, anything.  I'm having tons of fun experiencing new
  experiences tonight with MH and have (jeez we're camping out on
  futons in the guest room while his wife is in the main room (I
  presume) and I'm trying to turn off the light and explain that I can
  type just fine without it and he's like turning it back on insisting
  that it's okay; I hope he falls asleep soon; we're scheduled to be
  awake and ohgodthirty (4:30)) really enjoyed this and part of me has
  wondered if I could settle in this area and ride the とかいど line
  for an hour to work every day, and part of me realizes I could
  settle anywhere, but I don't want to settle anywhere cause I want to
  see everywhere first.</p>

<p>じゅんこ, his daughter called and asked to talked to me and I
  yammered with her a *bit* in Japanese like, "what is your name" (おな
  まえは何ですか。) and something else easy, oh spelling her name in
  Japanese and then she said "あってください。" and it took me a bit
  to understand what she meant, basically a polite "I look forward to
  meeting you," and I'm like, "oh 私も" and it all begins
  again.  <em>Junko, junko, how old is Junko?  Could I stand to have
  Masahiko as my inlaw? I wonder if she's cute?</em> etc and it's like
  holy shit dude, cut it the fuck out, but it's still there; it still
  happens.</p>

<p>でも, I wonder what what what I'll do in the world.  I've
  considered writing to "famous" people who have guided me to ask for
  more guidance, but I know that the guidance really must come from
  within (thank you Kristen (do you still read this?) for banging me
  on the head with that one (will you ever kiss me? (oh shit I should
  probably erase that)) a couple years back) and fuck if I'm not
  quite sure how to get at it (meditation, dingaling)</p>

<p>So my idea is basically that I can never settle, never be
  satisfied, until I find that settled place within myself (yes I know
  it's a process (Jennifer (same b-date 5 years later))) and not black
  and white (Bryn), but there's still got to be some mysterious red
  pill that I'm missing that will show me the truth.  Right?</p>

<p><em>boo-boooo.</em></p>

<p>Yes, the truth is that I don't actually want *anyone*; I want parts
  of everyone; I want my mommy to take care of me; I want to know (be
  told) what to do all the time; I want to do everything myself (in
  the ER, covered in bandages and white astral light, "no problem,
  Dad, I got it under control.") and I want to be <em>the best</em> at
  everything I do.  ("You're not cool; you'll never win, if you're not
  Arian; Aries, Aries, we're the best; we're better than all the rest"
  or something like that [and] "... cause Aries are the best." "Of
  course!")</p>

<p>I want to look back upon my life and be <em>amazed</em> at what
  I've done.  I just want to be like, "wow.  Good job."</p>

<p>Okay; maybe that's all for now.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>nothing else came to mind while I read comics.  Supposed to be
  awake in 2.75 hours.  good night.</p>
