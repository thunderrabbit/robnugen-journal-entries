<p>Today was me an' ¤æ¤ß's first lesson at Gateway 21 since she got
  too busy with work.  She's in the process of quitting her job now;
  her last day is in two days.  Yahoooo for her.</p>

<p>She said that my Japanese has gotten better since I've seen her.
  Yahooo for me!</p>

<p>We had a lot of fun.  Oh my gosh she gave me this funny funny
  funny funny deer!   Dammit I'm almost too tired to upload the .mov
  file.  I hope you can see it.</p>

<p>Oh my gosh now I'm going to try and trim the first bit of the
  movie so the file is not so big.</p>

<p>Barf.  Unbelievable.  Inconceivable, except, it happened.  I used
  iMovie to crop the movie (didn't do anything except trim the front
  and back off the movie and then save as web file) and after I saved
  it I tried to view it, but it's just black.  No deer.  That sucks,
  dude.  Utterly reasonable with windows, but not on my Mac.  All
  this video shit is integrated.  Why doesn't it just work????</p>

<p>Anyway, yumi and I had big big fun.</p>
