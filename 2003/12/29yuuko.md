<p class=date>10:48pm JST Monday 29 December 2003</p>

<p>§Ê§ﬂ cancelled tonight (because Gateway 21 is closed today) so I
emailed Õµª“ and said we could hang out after all.</p>

<p>Õµª“ called me after her work and drove out to πÀ≈Á where we ate
  at Miho's and studied Japanese at my apartment for a bit.  She read
  the robot crab story to me in Japanese and then I read (read made
  up) an English version for her given the pictures in the story.</p>

<p>Recognized the huge danger of having her spend the night so sent
  her home.  I'm going to hang with her tomorrow at 2 in Cinecitta and
  we'll go check out the bajillion lights at Millenario (sp) somewhere
  near Ginza I think.</p>

<p>Called janette and now I'm bout to go to bed bed bed.</p>
