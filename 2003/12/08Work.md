<p class=date>8:10pm JST Monday 8 December 2003</p>

<p>Good times at work today.  Pretty easy day, for which I'm
  definitely thankful.  Saw high school Miki there; she attended voice
  for the two non-consecutive timeslots surrounding my voice duty.
  It's rare for students to leave a lesson (or voice) early, but fully
  one half of the students left voice today.  He was apologetic, and I
  was like, "it's cool, bro," but I was left with a man to man 7C ish
  student who could answer in one or two words and not form questions
  for me.</p>

<p>My last lesson was with a 5 year old named Haraka I think.  She was
  pretty non-responsive to my boring non-five-year-oldness, so we had
  a lesson under the table.  That was hopefully fun for her, but it
  kinda cramped my neck.  Oh well.</p>

<p>That was my last lesson and I was like yeeeha I get to ride my
  bike outta here!</p>

<p>But then...</p>
