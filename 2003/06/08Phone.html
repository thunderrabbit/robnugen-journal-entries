<p class=date>5:45pm JST Sunday 8 June 2003</p>

<p>My phone rang a couple times during work.  Well, it vibrated, and I
of course may not answer it during class.  And there was no number on
the caller ID so I don't know who called.  I'm hope hope hoping it was
Rie, and that she got my message.  But if it is her, I'm surprised
that there was no number since I assume she's in Japan.</p>

<p>I'm going to hit the internet cafe soon and see if she sent me an
email.  I'd really like to get in touch with her.</p>

<p>It'd be doubly cool if I can see her tonight and have both of us go
to Kimberly's house for dinner and Japanese yammering.</p>

<p>I'm on the train going home now; the weekend business (I mean
busy-ness) at work is over.</p>

<p>Turns out it was Kimberly calling to say she and her husband got
food poisoning and therefore chose not to entertain tonight.  I'm
like, "oh of course; take care of yourself" etc, and she was like,
"are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Yeah; what am I gonna do, come over anyway?"</p>
