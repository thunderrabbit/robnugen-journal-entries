<p class=date>5:48pm JST Sunday 8 June 2003</p>

<p>The quote of the day at work:</p>

<pre>
The castle has an elevator in it.

It's a funny castle.
</pre>

<p>I found out today that Guy does pushups between classes if he has
time.  Like he'll knock out 50 pushups in a couple minutes.  He has
daily goals of like 400 pushups.  Nice.</p>

<p>I also learned from some level 3 students that the rainy season
doesn't begin until June, with June 8th being the average start date.
(Today)</p>

<p>According to the weather forecast, the rainy season will start on
Wednesday.  According to the students, the big storm we had a couple
weeks ago was a quite rare occurance.</p>

<p>I told them that I thought typhoons and hurricanes were no big
deal.. or rather that they were exciting and not scary.  Cause we've
got <em>tornadoes</em> (and one of the students finished the word with
me)........  I gave them the scary details of tornadoes (plus some
vocab): chaotic, 300 mph winds, small, how they can disappate then
regenerate, cause houses to explode (so we open windows to protect
against that), etc.  Two of the students seemed intrigued, and one
wasn't all that talkative; I wonder if he'll tattle on me for a non
Nova lesson.</p>

<p>Ah well; it was good stuff.</p>
