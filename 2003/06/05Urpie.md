<p>I felt urpie pretty much all day at work today.  Like that slightly
light headed feeling when I'm just about vomit, but not <em>quite</em>
yet.  A couple times (four times?) during the day while talking, I
just had to, like, stutter, a bit, to keep my urps from upchucking on
the table, and then the sensation would turn into a cough and I'd
cough into the crook of my elbow.</p>

<p>urp.</p>

<p>A student of mine said, "I saw your homepage." and I'm like really?
and lo, though I was so careful to not tell many people, I wrote it on
my self description card - like meet the teachers and all our pictures
are up on the wall with likes and dislikes below them.  At the bottom
of mine says www.robnugen.com.  Whoah.</p>

<p>Her name was Ç¶Å›, I think.</p>

<p>I leveled up a student named ÅﬂÇÆÅ›.  She had had a level up slip
in her folder for about a week and for some reason, no one had given
it to her.  So we reconstructed two levelups for her today.</p>

<p>But I still felt upchuckie.  Was able to eat rice and basically
good food (no chocolate gorging today), but still unsettled.</p>
