<p>I'm thankful to have my small room at the front of our apartment.
It's just off the entry way, opposite the bathroom.  A door separates
the entry area from the living room.  Frank and Matty have their rooms
on either side of the living room.</p>

<p>I'm thankful because Frank and Matty have the air conditioner set
to Stun.  It's like a fucking ice factory in their area.</p>

<p>I've just got my window open and a fan blowing.</p>

<p>PLUS, outside the air is SO NICE right now!  There's a blustery
breeze like that which announces the arrival of a storm (not that a
storm is coming, but that's what it reminds me of), and it's just
lovely.</p>

<p>Aight; I gotta roll for Japanese lessons with Ayana.   I didn't do
as much pre-writing of sentences as last week, but I did some last
night.</p>
