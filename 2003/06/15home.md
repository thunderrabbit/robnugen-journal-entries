<p>Mr Tired, eh?</p>

<p>I'm glad I came home.  I'm full of food and cookies and orange
juice (mostly the latter two), and have just watched <em>The
MATRIX</em> on the DVD Koko loaned to me.  Rock awesome.  Just as good
as the first ten times I've seen it.</p>

<p>Didn't watch the chapter where Cipher kills the good guys; I don't
like watching Switch die.  Not like that.  (haha get it?)</p>

<p>I still think my ending of the movie is better, though.</p>

<p>I'm going to sleep for some hours and then I'll play online for
probably a while.</p>

<p>Hahaha I'm one easy day away from my weekend.</p>

<p>Goodnight.</p>
