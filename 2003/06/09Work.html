<pre>
lesson 1: man to man (no show)
lesson 2: man to man (no show)
lesson 3: man to man (level 4, she talked the whole time)
lesson 4: voice room (no show)
lesson 5: man to man (level 6.  I've had this guy for the last three
                      days but I still don't remember his name.  He
                      was in the class where we played 2 Truths And A
                      Lie (2 days ago) and yesterday when we played 10
                      Fingers.)

<p>And then my last three lessons were packed, but they went pretty
well; I had planned them during my free lessons.</p>

<p>The quote of the day:</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>Oh!  And a woman loaned me a picture book on Japanese culture, just
naming (in Romaji) tons of stuff to be found in and around Tokyo.
Foods, shrines, other things and more stuff.  Wow; what a
blessing!</p>
