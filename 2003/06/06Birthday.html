<p>Today is あき's birthday.  Her mom came to visit her on Thursday; I
assume they'll be kickin' it during her birthday.</p>

<p>Laura's birthday is close to now, but I don't remember what date
exactly.</p>

<p>I love the summer.  It's already quite light outside.  I'm going to
go see what's out there.</p>

<p>I went to sleep instead.</p>
