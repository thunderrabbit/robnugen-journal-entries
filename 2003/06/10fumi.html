<p>ふみ is so great!  She said my journal is たのしみ for her.  I
didn't know what that meant, but beamed when we translated it.</p>

<p>ふみ seems to be quite a good student.  She may inspire me to begin
studying Japanese more effectively.  And she says she uses my journal
as a study resource!  I assured her some of the language on my site is
not polite, but I'm honored/happy to have some multi-lingual
readers!</p>
