<p class=date>8:52am JST Sunday 22 June 2003</p>

<p>Usually when I run, my backpack goes wagga-wagga-wagga-wagga from
side to side, kinda throwing me off balance.</p>

<p>This morning I was on the bicycle side of the street, impatiently
waiting for a break in traffic.</p>

<p>Heard a train, looked up and saw my train sailing over my head.
"I'm gonna catch that train."</p>

<p>Exploded across the street then full out <em>sprint</em>ed, as fast
as possible to catch that train.  No bag waggling.  All pendulum wave
forms merged to a slight vibration.  Feet: ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta on
the pavement.  People: part like a sparse red sea.</p>

<p>Dogleg curve (can kill a man) between the posts into the station.
Wallet out, ticket out, ticket in, grab ticket, run upstairs against
the flood of people coming down.</p>

<p>Doors-closing bell ringing.  Hand goes in the door (so at least my
fingers will take the train).  I make the train.</p>

<p>Ooooo sheen of sweat sneaks out on my head and torso.  Breathe.
Relax.  Hmmm don't pass out.</p>

<p>By the time I got on the next train at Musashi-Kosugi, I was pretty
much fine.</p>
