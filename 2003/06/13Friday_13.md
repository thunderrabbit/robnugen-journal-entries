<p class=date>11:26am JST Friday 13 June 2003</p>

<p>Woke up a tad later than usual on Friday.  Zing through a shower
(no shave, washing only the essentials), zing to the train station,
perfectly made the 8:45am local train to Shibuya.  For some reason, we
were not passed by an express nor a limited express train during our
transit.</p>

<p>I wonder what is the simplest way to express the train schedule.
There's several components to it - basically when the trains will
arrive at a particular station, and how fast they'll travel.  Though
those are inexorably (sp) linked.  But there's also a component of
trains passing other trains at particular stations.  Some stations
have only one track through them, so the express trains cannot
possibly pass the others.</p>

<p>Yadda yadda yadda; I don't yet have it all figured out.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Got to Starbucks in Shibuya just in time to meet Ayana.  Bought an
expensive sandwich (not because it was big, but because I was at
Starbucks).</p>

<p>Ayana was quite impressed with the sentences I had written last
night.  That positive feedback / good feeling is definitely enough to
make me do *that* again.   Plus it's good practice.</p>

<p>She gave me adjectives today - those that end with i and others
that end with na.</p>

<p>Told me how to use to (and / with), and maybe something else.</p>

<p class=date>6:50pm</p>

<p>Work is not over, but I have the quote of the day, a question:</p>

<pre>
"Have you eaten in Japan?"
</pre>

<p>And this was uttered by a level 6 student who I've been teaching
each week for the past month at KQ.</p>
