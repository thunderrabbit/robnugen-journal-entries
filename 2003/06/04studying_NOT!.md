<p class=date>12:38am JST Thursday 5 June 2003</p>

<p>Tonight I've successfully not studied; I've sent a bunch of emails
and reduced the number of emails in my Inbox to 29.  It was over 100 a
few days ago.</p>

<p>I also played with Fred's puzzle for about an hour.   Still
couldn't solve it.  Excellent.  I hope he has at least as much fun
with it.</p>

<p>I'm gonna prepare my brain for tomorrow, maybe study, maybe not,
then sleeep.</p>

<p>ps: with the students I'll be privately tutoring, I should make
enough money for my daily expenses.  Awe.some.</p>
