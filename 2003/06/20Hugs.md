<p>I have just finished my lesson with Ayana in Shibuya.  I was way
distracted during the lesson.  My emotional body is all awry.  I think
crying may help.  brb.</p>

<p>Crying helped a bit I think.  Or maybe a bit of crying helped a
lot, possibly what seems an incredible amount of goodness for a tiny
bit of crying.</p>

<p>Possibly there's more to emotions than I totally understand.</p>

<p>("Haha that is joke.")</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>When Ayana could tell I was distracted, she asked "are you sure
you're okay?" and I could just feel the emotion on the edge of
exploding out, no I feel like bawling cause I haven't hugged anyone
since I've been here.  Haven't trusted anyone enough to hug a real hug
like in I-group.  A fake hug would be just pointless and patronizing
to my need.  A sex hug would be relatively easy to get, but I don't
really want that.</p>

<p>Oh hey, Frank is back in town.  I might (haha there's another
word-fuck) talk to him about his connections with men through AA.</p>
