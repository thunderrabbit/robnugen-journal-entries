<p>Great night with ふみ - first teaching her, and she gave me a
chocolate something that I've not opened yet, so I don't know exactly
what it is.  She set herself a goal of learning the language in
Chapter 2 of the book we're using.  Next week we will have a
conversation with that language.  "How many CDs do you have?  What
type of music do you like?  Do you like pop music?" and the like.
(not just about music, but structures like those)</p>

<p>Then zipped over to a Mexican food restaurant and yammered with
Andrew et. al. - Stewart, Andrea, Toron (sp), Ben, James, and one more
cat whose name I don't remember.  ふみ basically followed the
conversations, and participated as well as she was able.  That rocks.
And gives me inspiration that I could do the same thing in
日本語.</p>

<p>After dinner all the others went off to get drunk.  ふみ and I did
not.</p>

<p>On the way back to 渋谷 station, I asked her what was the
meaning of some counter on a billboard, and then I realized it didn't
say "6478", but "647日" with the last character being the kanji meaning
day.  The billboard is an advertisement for the Tokyo Expo, which will
begin 647 days from yesterday.  In scanning the rest of the billboard,
I noted "2003先 03月 25日"  It starts on my birthday in 2005!</p>

<p>ふみ explained most of the kanji on the thing, and I told her I had
just read about the technology to be used on the tickets: each ticket
will have a unique RFID tag (Radio Frequency IDentifier (I think!)),
which is basically the new generation of barcodes.  The difference:
barcodes must be scanned by visible light (laser), but an RFID can be
scanned via radio waves.</p>

<p>I don't know how the tickets will be handled at the Expo, but this
type of technology could bring to reality instant checkout at the
grocery store.  No individual scanning needed.  Just roll the cart
through a portal and bang it's all scanned.  (possible exception of
food that is sold by weight).  I'm sure there are one or two or a
million-jillion more possibilities for the technology.</p>

<p>I read about it <a
href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/030523/36/e0npu.html">here</a>.  For
the record, I predicted individual bills would eventually be
scanned/monitored.</p>
