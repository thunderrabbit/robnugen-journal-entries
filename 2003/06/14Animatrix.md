<p>Today after work I watched Animatrix and most of the extra stuff on
the DVD.  Interesting, but not amazing.  I'm not particularly
enthralled with animation, though I have an intrigued respect for
those who produce it.  I just think, "damn, that sure is a lot of
images to draw."</p>

<p>When listening to the commentary, I could see intellectually why
they used certain techniques, but watching the actual clips didn't
consciously fill me with the emotions they seemed to</p>

<p>bollucks. (how do you spell that?)</p>

<p>They were like blah blah blah we tried to convey this emotion and
that other with the blah blah and I'm like, meh.</p>

<p>The only thing that I did get while watching the film was that a
set of the scenes of the robot vs human war included many scenes from
actual human tragedies people have inflicted upon one another.</p>

<p>I gotta drop off the kids at the pool and go to bed.</p>
