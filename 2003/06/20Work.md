<p class=date>9:29pm JST Friday 20 June 2003</p>

<p>Work at KQ was pretty fine today.  I had all man to man lessons
except for one (2 guys).  And I did my first level check.  He was 65
years old, and about level 7C.   A high level 7C; I recommended that
he be given high level lessons and auto-level up in 5 classes if all
five instructors thought he passed the lessons.</p>

<p>I'm developing a crush on Sumika, who works in KQ full time now.
She speaks English pretty darn well and though some people have
suggested she's rude, she seems quite polite and nice to me.</p>

<p>Wende has said this is my one romantic-tragic-flaw: I won't stop
looking.</p>

<p>I gave my email address to a woman today and felt no remorse nor
regret.  In this case it's not that I hope to bang her, but she seemed
like a cool cat and we might be able to do a language exchange.  We'll
see.</p>

<p>The quote of the day:</p>

<pre>
You've been here 85 days and you know hiragana?

You're so clever.

<p>I got a seat on the train going home, which is rare cause the train
is packed.  There's no one sitting next to me, though there is room.</p>

that comment about how you dont stop looking...for love i am assuming.<br>
<br>
why the heck should you stop?  i mean untill you KNOW for a fact that this other person "COMPLETE"  but if their were to be any slight imperfection in your feelings you shouldnt settle for anyone person...you should look so that youcan be complete....well i suppose thats why we have soooo many divorces these days...people are settling instead of looking...<br>
