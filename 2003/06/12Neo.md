<p>I ask if anyone has questions for me at the beginning of most of my
Nova lessons.  Sometimes they ask "how long are you in Japan?" or "How
long Japan?" or "How long do you in Japan?"  From now on I might tell
them the number of days I've been here.  (After correcting their
English) It's a tiny way of shattering the crystal Nova way of doing
things.  It's not even against any of the rules, so it's my perfect
little thing; I can tell people how many days I've been here.</p>

<p>So I worked it out.</p>

<p>I've been in Japan 77 days.  This is my 77th day in Japan.  Any
students who ask me how long I've been in Japan (I'll probably be
asked 4 times today) will find out that I've been here 77 days.</p>

<p>Being me, I decide I want a days-in-Japan counter on my site.  I
think I'll put it on my journal page only.  Top right corner maybe.
Next to the navigation icons.  Might have to rewrite some perl.</p>

<p>Okay, I want to design it right *now*.  Fuck Nova; I want to work
on my site.  Energy building, nowhere to go...  I want to pull a Neo
and just BLAM!  Blast out of here.</p>
