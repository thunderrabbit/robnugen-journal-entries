<p class=date>9:55am JST Thursday 12 June 2003</p>

<p>Rain is a fine misty sprinkle barely perceptible.  Tiny little dots
appear on my glasses.  I woogie my hand through my buzzed hair and no
water runs down my face or neck.  Not enough water to form a single
drop.</p>

<p>Woke up without an alarm this morning (an alarm is rare for me
here; I've used mine maybe 10 times, and I think all those times were
before early May), though I was a bit groggy after being awake so late
online and yammering with janette.</p>

<p>Shower seems to be collecting mildew again.  I may scrub it down
again.  The rainy season is apparently good for mildew growth.</p>

<p>Helped Aki learn how to give directions today.  "Go this way
(point) two blocks.  Turn right and go to the second light.  You'll
see the park on your left."</p>

<p>I wrote for her instructions on how to get to Kawasaki Nova (how to
get to the station, take the train, take the next train, etc etc)</p>

<p>Gave her homework: how to get to Kawasaki Nova without using the
trains.  She prefers taking the bus.</p>
