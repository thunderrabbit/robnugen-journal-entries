<p class=date>9:25am JST Monday 23 June 2003</p>

<p>I spent all my cash down to 6 yen last night.  I didn't want to
withdraw money during the weekend (105 yen service charge), and
somehow I was able to pay for lunch with some of the guys (Cory, Guy,
Jon M) from work at a miso place, spend five hours online, and get
orange juice and chocolate on the way home.</p>

<p>I shaved my head again.  Shaving 3 weeks worth of growth with a
disposable razor was ....... challenging.  I won't likely try it
again.</p>

<p>I missed a couple spots that I'm about to fix now.</p>
