<p>As I walked outside to my bike I noticed that I hadn't looked over
my list of things to make sure I have when I left.  Checked my pockets
and everything seemed fine.  Didn't go back to check.</p>

<p>Got to the bike place, carefully found the closest spot on Aisle C
and lifted my bike over other bikes to put it there.  Somehow kept the
tires from hitting my white shirt.</p>

<p>As I left the bike place I somehow noticed that I wasn't wearing a
tie.</p>

<p>Forgot my fucking <em>tie</em>.</p>

<p>Back back back home put on a tie and didn't even make sure it was
the optimal length.  The tail sticks out about 1 cm past the head(?)
what is the big part of a tie called??</p>

<p>Carefully stuffed another tie in my bag to leave at work so I can
forget it again and just put one on at work.</p>

<p>Paying 150 yen to get to ÇﬁÇ≥ÇµÇ±Ç∑Ç¨ (3 stations away) so I can
add $ to my train pass.  Can't do it at Å¬Ç»ÇµÅ‹.</p>

<p>Saw Kimberly talking to some western cat in the train station.
Waved to her, but didn't stop to chat.</p>
