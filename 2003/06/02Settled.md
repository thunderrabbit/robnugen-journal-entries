<p class=date>9:20am JST Monday 2 June 2003</p>

<p>I slept diligently last night; woke up at 6:22 to pee, but went
back to bed until 8:50.  I had told myself, "self, you're going to
Lloyd's tomorrow to sign up for that money transfer thing."</p>

<p>Today was the big day and I thought eek that I've slept too late to
do it before work and I had the option of feeling all pooey at myself
and frantic to get it done so I would have done what I said, etc.</p>

<p>But instead of taking that option, I simply looked for Lloyd's on a
map.  Ah.  It's somewhat near Shibuya, a place I need to go tomorrow
to meet a student.  Perfect plan falls into place.  Of course I'll
just go tomorrow after my Japanese class.</p>

<p>Then the pieces fall into place around the plan like a perfect
puzzle:  *today* I'll make breakfast for myself, get ready for work,
on the way to work get a calendar to write in all the private students
I'll be getting, go to work.</p>

<p>*Tomorrow* I'll ride my bike to Japanese class, ride a bit further
down to Kikuna, take the Limited Express (fast) train to Naka-Meguro,
change trains and go to Lloyd's, go to Naka-Meguro and zip up to
Shibuya (very close), kick it and study around Shibuya (maybe call Dru
Daddy and invite him), then meet my student at Hachiko in Shibuya at
6pm, then meet my second student all the way back down at Kikuna,
where my bike will be waiting patiently.  Perfect plan.</p>
