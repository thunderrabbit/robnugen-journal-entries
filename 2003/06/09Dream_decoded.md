<p>Yay Janette for decoding the dream from a week ago!</p>

<p>I've fixed the typos of what she sent me, as I do for all my
dreams.</p>

<p class=lucid>So I held onto Spot and we were moving along a trail
and some other people were having a picnic on the side. They were also
eco tourists and I was new to the group, but my group and their group
knew one another, though they were in different parts of the
group... Our group liked the sun and their group liked something else,
or was it the other way around? and someone in our group yelled
mock-taunting over to them, hey you don't like the sun!  or something
equally silly, and a woman yelled back yeah, well you've got no pants
on! with the implication that we don't like the sun, or we wouldn't
cover up, and we were all oooooh she burned you. and Eric was like,
well, actually she didn't burn him because she also has no pants and I
was like, dude, but did you see who it was-who burned him? She never
does that kinda thing.</p>
