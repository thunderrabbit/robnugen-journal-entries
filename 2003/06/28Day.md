mom asked me to type this for you since i'm a faster typer than she.

hi today is the day that i covertly did not write any comments in
most students' files that i taught today
and. uh. after work cory showed me the ________ door on top of hiroshi
station where i bought a telphone for the new apartment phone
number. yay. and found out that the phone works. yay.
and then went with janis j-a-n-i-s and cory and clayton and mike to a
park and slid down the slide with those little rollers on it and
climbed across the top of the swing set -or walked across it- <b>and</b> did
the little fucking bronco coil spring thing sideways trying to get my
center of gravity back on top of the horse and when i climbed some
archway thing cory <b>and</b> clayton got the five spring loaded fucking
broncos to buck back and forth really fast and then clayton and cory
tried to bow as fast as they were bucking. it was very funny. and i
got home and called janette and it was great and then my computer
died. and so i left a message on her machine and she transcribed
it. it was great. thanks bye.
