<p>Just now I had a man to man lesson with a female who triggered me a
little bit.  Smile and nice teeth and all that.  When she seemed so
thankful for my suggestion that she look on google for hostels, I was
sooo tempted to give her my email, "in case you have any problems."</p>

<p>I didn't give it to her.</p>

<p>At the very end, I was like "do you have any more classes?" as I
always ask, and she goes "no; do you have any more classes?" and I had
a break next (now), but got stuck on whether to answer I have two more
classes, but go until 9 o'clock, or to.. and I just flipped a bit and
wrote "I work until 9 o'clock" on a new piece of paper and gave it to
her with the fantasy that she would show up discreetly waiting for me
so we can talk and flirt.</p>

<p>And now I'm like "shit" what am I doing? and want her *not* to be
here and *not* to show up, etc.  She almost certainly won't come back,
and if she does I can be like "whatever, dude," but that's kinda
shitty - or really the shit thing was telling her that in the first
place, but the real thing seems to be learning why am I alone in
Japan?</p>
