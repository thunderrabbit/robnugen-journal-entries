<p>Mailed Milo to Bryn.</p>

<p class=date>5:17pm</p>

<p>Chilled at Kimberly's with Olivia and Grace.</p>

<p>Barely on time to see Fumi in Shibuya.</p>

<p>Didn't call her as I said I would to tell her the price of the
book.  Might give it to her.   Train now.</p>

<p>Aight.  So today has been pretty weekendy.  Japanese class was cool
this morning.  Kimberly was way distracted because Landen was crying
like crazy in the next room.  I was sorta distracted as well, knowing
that she was distracted, but I can't exactly explain why.</p>

<p>All four of us separated after class; Olivia got oranges; Grace did
whatever she does; I remembered that I was going to send a bag of Milo
to Bryn in London.</p>

<p>I'm glad to have completed that item on my to-do list.</p>
