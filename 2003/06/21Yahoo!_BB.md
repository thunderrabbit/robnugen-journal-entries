<p class=date>7:26pm JST Saturday 21 June 2003</p>

<p>Today after work, riding the train home with Cory, I decided to
forge ahead with signing up with Yahoo! BB, not waiting for some
friend who can speak Japanese to help.  "I'll test the Japanese
customer service and see what I can get them to do for me.  I'll just
hand over my bank book and my gaijin card and be like, 'hook me
up!'"</p>

<p>Previously, I had seen a Y!BB table set up outside the Tokyo Hands
(?) store.  It was there tonight and I talked to a cat named Toshihiko
I think, who explained in pretty decent English what it would take to
get signed up.  First we gotta get a phone line with NTT. Actually
there is a line in the apartment, but we have to buy or rent a line
from them.  (I still don't really understand buying a phone line,
unless that means buying/renting a phone number, similar to buying a
domain name online)</p>

<p>He called NTT for me, but they've gone home for the night, and will
go home before I get off work tomorrow.  So on Monday at 11am I'll go
back to the Yahoo! BB table and talk to the staff person there, who,
according to Toshihiko, speaks pretty good English.</p>

<p>Rock on.</p>
