<p>Saw Matrix Reloaded again tonight.   I got to the theater a bit
late, which tends to bug me, but I'm mostly over it.  It was worth
missing a tiny bit of the movie to get a hug from Fumi.</p>

<p>So.</p>

<p>Matrix Reloaded kicked ass the second time, too.   I understood
more of the obtuse dialogue, and a couple more of the links between
scenes became apparent.  I did not however have a huge A-HA!
experience upon second viewing.</p>

<p>In a couple of scenes, I focused on slightly different parts.  Like
watching the truck's front tire instead of Morpheus and the
Key-Maker.</p>

<p>I might go see it again.</p>

<p>I'm definitely going to see more movies in Japan, and I'll probably
allow more time for getting to the theater.</p>
