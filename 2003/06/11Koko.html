<p>ここ checked my sentences; - very few grammar errors, but one big vocab
error.   I said "legs are on the table" instead of "legs are under the
table."  Hahahhhahahaa</p>

<p>Oh and she pointed out a spelling error I had been making.  I live
in こうほく.  Not こほく.</p>

<p>I jokingly said, "are you sure?"  She laughed.  "Yes; I live
here."</p>

<p>Told her about my quotes of the day.  Her quote of the day is
probably "あしはつくえのうえです。"</p>
