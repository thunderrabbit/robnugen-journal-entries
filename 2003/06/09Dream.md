<p>Earlier (before 2am) dream</p>

<p class=dream>The entire world had been clearcut except for the land
next to my dad's house.  I hugged my dad, thanking him for his
stability and for keeping that land.  During the hug he began to hug
someone else as well, and at first I felt jealous, and then I realized
he was bringing other people in to hug _me_.  I felt quite thankful
and quite loved.</p>
