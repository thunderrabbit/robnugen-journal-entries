(written 07:30 Monday 28 April 2025 ACST)

Over the past week or so I have been joyfully 懐かしい (なつかしい) reading comments that my YRUU peeps (including lovely janette) left in my old perl journal.

janette tried to decipher part of my dream that I had written with my right hand on the wrong position of the keyboard.  Out of laziness, I sent it over to ChatGPT:

<p class="note">Almost correctly decipher by ChatGPT 27 April 2025:</p>

<pre>
    Someone really said something and a woman yelled back,
    "yeah well you
    we got plants on!
    with the implication that we don't
    100% complete sun or we will
    cover. and we were all
    "Ooooo she burned too!"
    and Eric was like,
    "well actually she didn't
    burn too, because she also has plants."
    and I was like,
    "side bit, did you see who it was who burned too? She always does that kinda thing."
</pre>

ChatGPT determined `"` had become carriage returns (which I originally missed), but ChatGPT missed the `'` had *also* become carriage returns.
