<p>Back in the day (April 1987), I started my diary in an actual
book.  I've decided to transcribe all those old books, so I brought
the first book to Japan.  I haven't transcribed any of it, although I
may have transcribed some while on the plane here.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's been chillin' in the bottom drawer of my plastic chest
of drawers and I noticed last night that a fine layer of mold? had
grown on it.  EEEEK!!!  Not acceptable.  Fortunately, it wiped off
easily, with no apparent damage to the book itself.</p>

<p>I just sent it to janette, so she can read it and protect it
from the dreaded Japanese Plastic Drawer Mold.</p>

<p>On the way out of the post office, I saw a little fuzzy caterpillar
(omushi) on the ground.  I carefully stepped over it, and watched as a
mom and her mom(?) and a little one in a stroller went in.</p>

<p>The omushi got mooshed, stepped on by one of the women.  I wondered
if it would recover, a little bruised, but still kickin' it (as much
as caterpillars can kick).  He didn't seem to recover, a little wet
spot on the ground, and the omushi probably left little moosh spots in
the post office.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>shudder</em></p>

<p>It makes me wonder how blithely unaware I am while walking through
the world.</p>
