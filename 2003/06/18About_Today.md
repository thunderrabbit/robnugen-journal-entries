<p class=date>7:48pm JST Wednesday 18 June 2003</p>

<p>Hands down most happy/unexpected thing today: Matty took my
passport to Lloyd's so I didn't have to fax a copy to them.  I'm
thankful that I remembered my need when he said he was going!</p>

<p>Doubly thankful that I was able to tell <em>him</em> to bring his
passport so he wouldn't have the same experience as I had
yesterday.</p>

<p>Couple days ago Aki cancelled our meeting on Thursday (tomorrow)
(radio).  On my way out the door today, she called and cancelled today
(fever).</p>

<p>I fucked around on my computer, trying to get it to execute cgi
scripts as a local web server, but couldn't get it to work.  Due to
directory permissions, at first I couldn't even serve text files, but
now I just can't serve results of executables.  My goal is to get days
in Japan counter on my site, and I wanna test it locally so I won't be
spending a lot of dollars at the cafe to do it.</p>

<p>Took a big ol' phat nap (haha fell asleep on my bed with my
computer on my chest; the screen hit my forehead as I drifted off..)
<em><b>whack</b>, hey jack, wake up!</em></p>

<p>Frank came home.  Apartment will be much louder than while Matty
and I were kickin' it alone.</p>

<p>I'm in Kikuna to meet Shin now.</p>
