<p>ここ brought her English texts for me to peruse.  I liked 1 for
ふみ, but it was too advanced.  Correct style, though.  She had one of
idioms which しん said he wanted.  Perfect.  We yammered mostly in
English today and traded funny advertisments.  Like the Nova うさぎ
listening to headphones and the headphones are on the correct part of
his head if he had human ears, but he's a rabbit, so his ears are way
up high.  He's doing some turntablism, and then someone's like, "hey;
where are your ears?"  and he goes, "oops" and gets embarassed.
That's some funny shit.</p>

<p>I told her about SEGA's commercials featuring Sonic the Hedgehog
turntabling at light speed.  "SONIC! ... Man, lay off da light
speed."</p>

<p>"My bad!"</p>

<p>ここ showed me some restaurants around きくな and we found a
bookstore that had the exact idiom book she had used.  Bang I bought
that for Shin, and then found a puzzle (two interlocking "rings"
(shaped more like bent paper clips)) that I could not solve in 10
minutes.  Bang I bought that for Fred.  (The other puzzles of
interlocking "rings" on display there I had solved in 30 seconds each,
but this one passed the test.)</p>

<p>I gotta go to Subway for my third possible student.</p>
