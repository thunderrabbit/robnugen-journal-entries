<p>Rar.</p>

<p>I'm blasting through obstacles like they's nuthin.</p>

<p>All my efforts are building a framework within which I can navigate
this crazy land.</p>

<p>NTT number coming soon to a phone jack near me.</p>

<p>Yahoo! BB ADSL coming soon to said NTT number.</p>

<p>IEEE 802.11b coming with it.</p>

<p><font size="-1">(that's <em>wireless</em>, baby)</font></p>

<p>Went to the bank and talked to Masahiko.  Though they were closing,
he let me in and helped me fill out the forms so my NTT bill will be
paid automagically.   Yahoo! will send me a form and I'll have him or
the peeps at Yahoo! BB table help me fill it out.</p>

<table border=1>
<tr><td valign=top><center>CHARADES</center>
<p>Without speaking, get players on your team to say the following words/phrases:</p>

<ul>
<li>sweeping</li>
<li>washing dishes</li>
<li>eating dinner</li>
</ul>
</td>

<td valign=top><center>ULTIMATE CHARADES</center>
<p>Without speaking their language, get players on the other team to
convince you, without speaking your language, they understand the
following words/phrases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yahoo! will send you a bank draft form.  Once you receive the
form, please fill it out and take it to your bank.  This will allow
Yahoo! to electronically withdraw funds from your account.</li>
<li>Yahoo! BB is offered free of charge until the end of the first
month that begins after service has commenced.
<li>Should you choose to discontinue using Yahoo! BB after the initial
free period, please contact Yahoo! in writing within 10 days after the
end of the trial period.</li>
<li>Should you continue to use Yahoo! BB after the initial period, you
will be charged a one time 3800 yen fee by NTT for some reason that no
one can explain.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table>

<p>At the Yahoo! BB table, we began a game of Ultimate Charades.
Thank goodness for some random woman who offered to translate before
we got too far into the game.</p>

<p>Okay, what does this new phone number spell? 045-543-7873</p>

<p>That's
<br>0
<br>GHI
<br>JKL
<br>JKL
<br>GHI
<br>DEF
<br>PQRS
<br>TUV
<br>PQRS
<br>DEF</p>

<p>I'll post the winning response.</p>
