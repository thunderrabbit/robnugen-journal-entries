<p class=date>7:39pm JST Saturday 21 June 2003</p>

<p>Right when I walked into work I was in a horrible mood.  Pissed off
did *NOT* want to be there, could not *stand* Benny's continuous
self-aggrandizing blather- putting others down etc, *Hated* the people
standing in front of the schedule (even Eric, whose one of the most
soft spoken integrous people at work), wanted to destroy the filing
system, etc etc etc etc.</p>

<p>As I copied down my schedule, I wrote "fuck off bitches" where I
usually write "ebark" or "barke" or "bekar" or some other anagram.</p>

<p>That was my little way of acting out without noticably destroying
anything.</p>

<p>My mood jumped up a happy notch when my first class was a no-show.
It slowly got better from there including my very last class where I
spent an extra 11 minutes with this guy who's going to Portland in
September.  He's about a 7A, but wants to learn how to reserve hotel
rooms, etc.  I think I really helped him a lot.</p>

<p>Quote for the day, after the previous person had said, "I can't
think of anything"</p>

<pre>
I think the same thing.
