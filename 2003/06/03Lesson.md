<p class=date>12:43pm JST Tuesday 3 June 2003</p>

<p>Japanese class was cool; Kimberly was across the table from me.
Slight distraction, but mostly I did well in Japanese until my brain
shut down after about 1.5 hours.</p>

<p>Olivia, Kimberly and I (and others?) might go to lunch after class
next Tuesday.</p>
