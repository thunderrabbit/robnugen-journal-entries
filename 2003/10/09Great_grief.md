<p>Zoom from the shuttle toward the ticketing area.</p>

<p>"American Airlines?"</p>

<p>"Over there but the gate is closed.   What is your destination?   Dallas?"</p>

<p>"Hai."</p>

<p>headsetphone guy behind booth.  bag X-rayed, baggage can't be
checked, must be carried on, but still got checked bag tags just in
case.</p>

<p>Zoom this way.  I lift both janette's bags over my head to get past
the turnstiles behind janette behind the guy.  White shirt black vest
red tie greets us. (This is it; quick hug kiss; "bye") Guy takes her
black suitcase.  Black vest zooms her through security express line.
Wave bye.</p>

<p>Guy came back.  "She's gonna make it on time."</p>

<p>"Domoarigatogozaimas."</p>

<p>janette still hasn't gone past the gates.  Oh, there she goes.
Wave bye through the glass.</p>

<p>Oh they're going past me.  Quick pick before they descend the
escalator.</p>

<p>"Bye."</p>

<p>Bang.  Then it hits.  Zoom to restroom, private stall.  Cry cry
cry.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm okay.</p>

<p>Good thing is that we extended our time together to the max.</p>

<p>Bang.  More crying.</p>

<p>Cute girls from Sweden.  Buzz off.  I give not a second glance.</p>

<p>Starbucks hot chocolate for comfort.</p>

<p>Speed-train to Yokohama = 4000+ yen.  I have 4000 yen.  1000 yen
train to Ueno, here I come.</p>

<p>I predict a <em>pissed off</em> day at work tomorrow.</p>
