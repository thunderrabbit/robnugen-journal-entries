<p class=date>12:09am JST Monday 27 October 2003</p>

<p>Called Kim at 9am (his time) on the dot (according to <a
href="http://www.timeanddate.com/">timeanddate.com</a>) but no answer.
Called again and no answer.  Few minutes later and he asked me to call
back in 10 minutes.  Who could possibly care about such minutiae in a
journal?  Will *I* even care in 10 minutes?</p>

<p class=date>12:38am</p>

<p>Called again an no answer.  I hope he's okay; this isn't like him
normally (a year ago).</p>

Hi Kim

I called and got a busy signal, then called again and left the
message.  I feared something might be "really wrong" so I didn't want
to keep calling.   I hung out with my roommate (playing video games as
bonding) and didn't hear the email beeps on my computer so I missed
your emails.     I too was looking forward to our call.

I will call you at 9am Friday October 31st.

With Love
- Rob!

I must have been on the phone when you called. I would have jumped off
to you, but I never heard the call waiting beep. I just now got your
message. Sorry we had a hard time. I was ready for you 5 minutes after
we spoke and was on another call for only five minutes
since. Otherwise, Ib12:48amve been here waiting for you since 9:15-ish
my time. Ib12:48amve got to leave now. If you still want to talk, send
me another email outlining some times.

My next opportunity will be Friday morning 10/31 at 9am my time.
