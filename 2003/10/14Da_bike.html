<p>I took Morisan's bike to the shop to replace the shifter that was
damaged while the bike was in my care.  Actually while it was in the
bike parking lot, and therefore under the care of random bike citizens
who didn't care for it enough to keep from breaking the plastic on the
shifter thing.   I'll pick it up tomorrow for 1500 yen or so.</p>
