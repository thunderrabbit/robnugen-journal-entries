Bought postcards, wrote one to Josephine, bought trolley passes,
rode around on the trolleys while janette yammered with a Japanese
woman who seemed she just wanted to practice speaking English.  Ended
up at Hiroshima port to track down our Starbucks bag with camera,
postcards, Hiroshima mug from Starbucks.</p>

<p>Eating at a pastry deli at Hiroshima Port now.</p>
