<p>October 3rd may have been the day that we happened upon an unmarked
free toilet when janette needed one and I had no idea where to find
one nor where we were really.</p>

<p>"yo daw, there's a toilet."  I pointed to a private residence by
which we were walking.</p>

<p>Her "reeally?"  Sounded like two things: she couldn't believe it, and
she really really wanted it to be true.  The effect of this sound upon
my heart was <em>oh my gosh I'm glad I wasn't joking.</em></p>

<p>After that, we found a temple from the back, one with a long set of
gates leading from a neighborhood to the temple up some hill.  We
climbed it, sat on a bench, "welp, we made it! (wherever we are, we
are here.)" and then went down a different direction and found
ourselves near Kyoto University.</p>
