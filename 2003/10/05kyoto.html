<p>Back in Kyoto we ate pastries and watched some kids from a
badminton team play a rhythmic verbal game involving counting and
quickness with rhythm.  I've seen the game before, but this appeared
to be a more complex version with a limit of 8 instead of 4.</p>

<p>"ooh we gotta go," I checked my watch and we had to be on the
shinkansen in 35 minutes.  From where we were, it turns out we coulda
made it in 12 minutes, but I'm quite happy to be early and take
pictures of shinkansens in the station for 20 minutes.</p>

<p>I bought some yumyums for the peeps at work as this seems customary
when one of us goes on vacation.   'specially Carla; she brings us
stuff all the time.</p>
