<p>Dinner with Shin was like a food giving away contest.</p>

<p>Shin and janette talked a lot and I transcribed a lot of what they
said.  This transcription was sent to Shin so he can practice it at
his convenience, grokking the sentence structures so he can use them
later.</p>

<p>Miho kept bringing us food like wow..   Maguro (raw tuna), tempura,
something (beef, potatoes with glass noodles), yakitori (skewered beef
tongue and veggies and beef bits and chicken globs), and baked squash
with mayonnaise dressing.</p>

<p>Feast.</p>
