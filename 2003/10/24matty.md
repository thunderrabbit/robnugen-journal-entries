November 24th is Matty's last day in Japan.

"We know you're seeing a student outside of work."

"No, I didn't see her."

"We have really good evidence you were seeing her."

"All I can say is two weeks ago she was all, 'I love you, I want to
come to London with you.  I'm going to go to London Art School.'"

"She said you were rude to her in Ebis."

"Well after she said all that how should I act around her?"

"We can sack you, or you can resign."

"I'll resign."

"Do you need time to think about it?"

"No.  Sign me up."

"Do you have anything to say?"

"Our two previous roommates have complained about a barking dog.  It
still plagues us."

"Do you have any comments for the record?"

"This is a nice pen."

"Go home."

To his mom:

"It genuinely feels like a weight off my shoulders.  I'm not going to
have to cut my hair."

"Here's the curse:  the guy whose room I'm living in is the only one
we know who got sacked from Nova.  And now I've followed in his
footsteps.   The night I met him, I remember he told me, 'I'm the only
guy who's gotten sacked from Nova.  Make sure it doesn't happen to
you.'"

"Literally five hours after I was told, I'm still buzzin'."

"I hope you and dad aren't pissed off at me."

"As soon as she told me, I knew I was going home.  The meeting was at
the end of my schedule and all day no one would tell me what it was
about.  They all said, 'I don't know, I don't know.'"

<br>yikes.  are you concerned about getting in trouble too?  did he get popped because he was dating a girl?  is that different from what you are doing? did they have sex and that is what went wrong there? <br>
