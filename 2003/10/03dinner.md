<p class=date>11:24am JST Saturday 4 October 2003</p>

<p>Didn't get any pictures of this little sushi shop, but we had the
place (and the attention of two women) while we ate and worked to
communicate.   We ended up eating 8 different types of sushi, hand
made, on the spot.  6300 yen.</p>

<p>They were really nice, the sushi really yummy, the bar really small
and cute with thick natural wooden counter.  I don't know how it
resists water and stains.</p>
