<p>My bike was fixed today!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We rode toward Kawasaki, but didn't make it..  stopped at a park
where I read to janette while she repaired a broken snap on my shorts,
replacing it with a button.  Magic.  And she mended my bicycle
gloves.  *And* she mended a velcro pocket thing on the shorts I was
wearing at the time.  Absolutely amazing.</p>

<p>We made it home in plenty of time to munch dinner with Shin at
Miho's.</p>
