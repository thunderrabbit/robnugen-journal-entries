<p>One good thing about going to amusement parks in the rain: fewer crowds.</p>

<p>Hakkeijima Sea Paradise was basically a ghost town.  Including us,
I saw 4 groups of people at the park.</p>

<p>There is one good coaster at HSP.  It's a large mine train coaster,
1/2 of which is set on piers in the bay.  I rode this coaster 7 times
today, and bought the picture five times.  Poses that I bought:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wazzap!</p></li>

<li><p>zzzzzz</p></li>

<li><p>hmmmmm</p></li>

<li><p></p></li>

<li><p>Eeeee (*)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These are the poses that I didn't purchase.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>[weird 3/4 view silly face] (this one didn't look as silly as I
hoped)</p></li>

<li><p>[Madonna's Vogue] (this one will look far better with a train
full of screaming people)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(*) I don't know the name of this pose, but it was suggested to me
as a good idea by the picture booth staff, and supported by Liz.  Liz
said if I show it to any Japanese, I'll steal the show.  I don't
really know what this means besides that.</p>

<p>Liz and I rode Blue Fall 4 times, a pretty tall drop tower.  Aw man
I didn't count the number of seconds of freefall, but I'd guess it
gives four full seconds of freefall time.</p>

<p>One day I'll get pictures on here.  I hope.</p>
