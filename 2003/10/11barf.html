<p>Blah</p>

<p>Trying to figure out how to extract images from email messages
automagically on my server so I can basically email them up there
instead of copying them.  Maybe it's a doomed endeavor.  I can't
really remember the line of thought that said it would solve all my
woes of too few images on my site.  oh wait; I kindof do.</p>

<p>Bah.</p>

<p>It's after midnight.  I'm going to bed.  If I remember (and wake up
early enough) I'll ride my bike to work tomorrow.  Oh, but that means
I'll need to find a something to lock it to.  Hmmm.</p>
