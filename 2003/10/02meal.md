<p class=date>8:42pm JST Thursday 2 October 2003</p>

<p>Ate dinner at a Chinese restaurant.  I forgot it was Chinese and
asked for okonomiyaki since janette has been looking forward to trying
some.  The waitress said "Chinese" in Japanese and I was like, "oh
yeah!" and ordered gyoza.  janette was having different trouble
ordering since she didn't know the word for noodles with chicken, and
I tried to help her ("soba, um, tori") which also wasn't working, so
the <em>cook</em> came over to rescue us.  He spoke far better English
than the waitress.</p>

<p>The gyoza wasn't like I expected (I must be used to the Japanese
version) but it was still pretty yummy.  janette got chicken and
broccoli which was even better.</p>

<p>After we finished, the cook came to ask if we wanted dessert.  I
told him he was a good salesman after we ordered ice cream and
cheesecake.  The cheescake was flavorless and the ice cream had bits
of orange peel in it.</p>

<p>janette gave me a bite of her ice cream and asked if I liked it.  I
was like, "the peel isn't very appealing to me."</p>

<p>She removed some peel and gave me a peel free bite.  I was like,
"peel free to give me another."</p>

<p>janette repealed the peel from a bite and I squealed with appeal
and delight.</p>

<p>Then we went to the hotel for the night.</p>
