<p>"My name is Takako."</p>

<p>:: "Hi Takako." ::</p>

<p>"I feel _______" (happy, sad, angry, afraid)</p>

<p>:: "You feel ______.  Thank you." ::</p>

<p>"My _____ is (most) important to me."</p>

<p>:: "Your ______ is important to you.  Thank you." ::</p>

<p>"I love my _____ (because ....)"</p>

<p>:: "You love your _____.  Thank you." ::</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I have heard that it's easier for Japanese to express their
emotions in English than in Japanese.  The above thoughts woke me up
with their significance.</p>

<p>At the meeting there would be Japanese written rules, and before
the meeting would be spoken instructions, <em>Whatever is spoken in
this room, stays in this room</em> and <em>you do not have to speak,
but you are welcome to.</em> The same sort of shit that is spoken
before 12 step meetings.</p>

<p>There would be 'definitions' of the basic emotions:</p>

<pre>
Happy:   :-)

Sad:     :-(

Afraid:  :-O

Angry:  >:-&lt;
</pre>

<p>and possibly Japanese sentences that describe the emotions (if that
can be done).</p>

<p>Today I'm going to have my students discuss what is most important to
them and why.</p>

<br>re-reading this entry- i am so happy you are going to use your situation to do important work.  you are great to think this way(was this in a dream?) and be so supportive and real.  i wonder what the powers that be(nova) will think of this?
