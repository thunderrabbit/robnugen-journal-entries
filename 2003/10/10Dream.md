<p class=date>8:25am JST Friday 10 October 2003</p>

<p class=dream>Flying between two sections of island over water.  Awe
inspiring view as I made it over the craggly black silouhette of rocks
and trees of the middle mountain ridge thing.  My dad was there to
support me getting across the water of the final section.  I was
flying slowly, not like superman or a jet, but like a cessna.  This
final section of water kept drawing me down and I couldn't stay aloft
over it; ended up in the water before I got to the next bit of land.
Swam to shore.</p>

<p class=dream>Found Amy Leyenberger and her friends having a tea
party in a secluded cave; they wanted to invite just their friends and
it was themed like a pirate movie; she had a purse that had a little
rotating deal that could say 1970 or 1770 or 1970 in a different font
or 1771, or 70 or a skull and crossbones that looked really old.
There was a video of the hours previous that they had been on this
crazy scary amusement park ride that hardly tied them into each seat,
and spun them thousands of feet in the air on this cliff-attached
octopus ride, like The Gunslinger, but not as many swings, and two
person seats and only a single rope loosely tied around their waist
for safety.</p>
