<p>Ayana is quite a patient teacher.  I'm pretty much going to quit
going to my Tuesday class because I get frustrated in there by the
native Chinese speakers who know kanji and zoom past me, plus the
teacher panders to them more than to me, because I'm totally sucking
ass in that class compared to them.  Blah; whatever.</p>

<p>Oh, plus that teacher (Hoso) knows limited English and doesn't seem
to understand when I need more time to answer, and doesn't hear me
when I answer correctly; she talks all over me and gives the answers;
fuck, it's just really frustrating, and distracts me from studying
just for one Japanese class.</p>

<p>Basically the internet distracts the hell out of me, and keeps me
from studying much at all, and when I'm trying (word-fuck word) to
study for two classes, it messes me up even more.</p>

<p>Today Ayana let me review some adjectives and their conjugations
for present, present-negative, past, and past-negative tenses.  She
said they are tricky for everyone.</p>
