<p>I'm hungry and tired.  I woke up at 5:30 cause I had to peeeeeee
and just stayed up to study.  (and shower).   Now it's time to go
study with Ayana.</p>

<p>But wait; I just got sidetracked: I need to try <a

sometime:</p>

<p>I'm really glad I looked for the clearly labled FAQ on his page
before I wrote to Andrew:</p>

Hi Andrew

I keep a journal online at http://www.robnugen.com/journal, and write
my entries with emacs locally on my G4 powerbook.

I'm currently living in Japan and learning Japanese so I often want to
write hiragana / kanji with emacs, but I can't figure out a way to
make it work.  Emacs crashes if I tell OS X to write using kanji.

My workaround is to write the original file with emacs, then use
TextEdit to write the kanji and save using Shift-JIS encoding.

On my site, I tell browsers to use Shift_JIS:
&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=Shift_JIS">

Currently I'm using OS X 10.2.8 and the stock emacs that's available
from Terminal.  (GNU Emacs 21.1.1 (powerpc-apple-darwin6.0) of
2002-07-28 on law)

I'm going to upgrade to Panther soon and will download the latest
binary available at http://www.webweavertech.com/ovidiu/emacs.html
(because I don't really understand how to use CVS)

Question[s]:

1) can you type kanji in emacs?
2) what version of emacs do you use?
3) how the heck do you do it?

Thanks!
- Rob
