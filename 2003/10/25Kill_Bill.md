<p>Saw Kill Bill at Cinecitta tonight with Morag, Marcus, Dennis, and
Lisa after I bought the tickets before work this morning.  Liked the
movie, but not as much as Pulp Fiction.  Not as much good dialogue.
Nice variety of filmographic styles.  Lots of untranslated Japanese,
which sucked.</p>

<p>Tons of blood.</p>

<p>Wiggled tushies a bit at an outdoor music thing with trance playing
not really loudly and about 7 Japanese guys wiggling around to it.
Dennis and I found that we both like jungle better.</p>

<p>Drank OJ while they drank beers at a bar.   Learned that Dennis
(wait, is that his name?) used to be a new producer in Florida at the
24th largest television news market station in the US.  Wow.  He told
us a story about being DRUNK and losing his shirt and car with no
recollection of having driven drunkenly and parking near Disney
World.</p>

<p>Got the last trains home to Tsunashima.  Packed last train.
Squshed.</p>

<p>I didn't join them in Tsunashima at Fat Mama's bar.  Washed smoke
smell out of my clothes instead.</p>

<p>I like the movie more now that I've slept on it for a night.  Good
parts keep popping up.  "oh yeah, that was pretty good / funny."</p>

<p>Lucy Liu zipping across the table in the geisha shuffle then
*shyop!*, choppin' that cat's head off.</p>

<p>XXX rubbing "BILL" off the glass with her cuff, then using her
finger to wipe off the last little bit.</p>

<p>the yakuza guys moaning all over the floor of the restaurant with
appendages cleanly removed</p>

<p>others?.... but i can't remember right now.</p>
