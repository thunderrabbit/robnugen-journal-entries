<p>Aw man.</p>

<p>It started off so well.  2:20ish train from Tsunashima.  Four hours
and ten minutes available to make a two hour trek.  But.  We got way
lost getting to Narita airport.  Not like way lost but somehow in
Ueno, we got on the wrong train and are in Narita, but not near Narita
airport.  Fuck Japanese train stations, man.  They stink.</p>

<p>Now we're in Narita-not-near-Narita-Airport in the chilly wind
waiting 30 minutes until we a train that'll take us to Narita
arrives.  Bluh.</p>

<p>I reallllly hope janette makes her flight.</p>

<p>Another weird thing is that we haven't seen any ticket gates since
Shibuya station.  We've only paid as far as Ueno.</p>

<p>Oh, ps: I knew how to get to the airport if we had gotten off the
Yamanote Loop the station before Ueno, but I had heard it's not a big
deal to get there from Ueno, and the last time I went to Narita I
noted that the station before Ueno (notice that I can't remember its
name now, the main reason I missed it) was in fact the second station
on the line from Ueno to Narita.  My presumption was that we could
therefore just get on that same line at its first station and zip to
Narita no worries.</p>

<p>Except for the part about finding that same line in Ueno.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Super strange also that the train needs to go from left to right to
get us to the station.  From the platform perspective, trains have
*always* gone from right to left (circulating on the left side of the
'road')</p>
