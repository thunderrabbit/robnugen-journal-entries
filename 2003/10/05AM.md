<p class=date>11:11am JST Sunday 5 October 2003</p>

<p>Chowed at the pastry bakery that janette scoped on our first night
in Kyoto.  Definitely less protein, more sugar, (and more dough) for
less dough than the hotel restaurant.</p>

<p>Checked out of the hotel at 10:30, walked outside, and I checked
our shinkansen tickets.</p>

<p>"We have 7 hours until we have to be somewhere.  Let's go to
Nara."</p>

<p>Awesome.   Walked without extra guidance and without errors to the
train and shooped to Kyoto station.</p>

<p>We dropped off our bags (I took all my clothes out of my backpack,
kept my backpack and computer) in a locker on the east side of Kyoto
station (locker 5068) and paid 690 each for the 40 minute train ride
to Nara.</p>

<p>(hmm; they've got grub on the train; I want some; oh yeah, I have
an extra yumyum from the bakery!)</p>

<p>This train is rather nice, with forward facing seats with
antimatamasgars (*) instead of sideways bench seats.</p>

<p>* This is what janette called the little plastic doily seat cover
things.</p>
