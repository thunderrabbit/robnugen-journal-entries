<p>Tonight, <a
href="http://www.solar-ark.com/english2/index.html">Sanyo Solar
Ark</a> looks like a huge low bowl striped with layers of blue lights.
It probably looks like this every night, but I'd never previously seen
nor heard of it until we just passed it on our way home on the
shinkansen. It's very near Gifu-Hashima station (next shinkansen
station from Nagoya when escaping Tokyo)</p>
