<p class=date>6:17pm JST Tuesday 21 October 2003</p>

<p>I called DruDaddyG and he told me a funny story.  He was listening
to slash reading a CD at HMV (big music store chain).  His mate was
like, "aight snoops, let's roll," and they went to a restaurant where
Dru discovered he was still holding the CD.</p>

<p>HAHAHAHhahaahahaaahhaha!</p>

<p>He was like, "What do I <em>do</em>???"   hahahaha</p>

<p>He is unavailable for hanging out tonight, but we promised text
messages tomorrow; he'll be in Yokohama.  I may be in Yokohama in an
effort to find the amusement park that Liz told me about today.</p>

<p>I couldn't find anyone else to call: it's too early to call Nami
(only after 7pm), I just called Miki yesterday, and a cointoss said
not to call Rieko (she and I are going to a plastination thing on the
29th)</p>

<p>So I'm on the train going back to Tsunashima now.</p>

<p>If one thing goes as planned, I'll meet Cory for a Wild Skating
Adventure tonight.</p>
