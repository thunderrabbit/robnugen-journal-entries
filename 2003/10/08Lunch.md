<p class=date>11:40am JST Wednesday 8 October 2003</p>

<p>Lunch at a place near the 100 Yen Store where they did not have in
stock any more canvases for me to create art.</p>

<p>This morning I read chapter xxxiv (I think) of Stranger in a
Strange Land to janette.  We were interrupted by two men at the
doorbell who wanted to clean the apartment.  They were sent by Nova
because the apartment was less than nice and clean when it was
inspected some couple weeks ago when they inspected it before Dan
moved in.</p>

<p>Since janette has been here, the apartment has been relatively
immaculate, and I felt a bit they couldn't just accept that and leave.
But they cleaned some places that would never have been cleaned -
behind the paneling around the tub, and they replaced the air filter
above the stove etc.  Okay fine.  You can stay.</p>

<p>But then they left and all was clean.  Still.</p>
