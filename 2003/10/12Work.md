<p class=date>2:39pm JST Sunday 12 October 2003</p>

<p>I'm at KQ today.  Texted Morag to see if she wants to hang on
Tuesday.</p>

<p>Tony yesterday and I today leveled up Kyoko from 6 to 5.  I think
she'll do well on the test.  She'll be fine in 5; she just needs to
speak up in group lessons.</p>

<p>Ooh she just finished; I'll grade it now.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>98% correct.  The one she missed was correct at first, but she
changed her first answer.  There was another first answer that she
erased and changed to correct, though.</p>

<p>I just wrote to sFord and g to see if they can help clarify how I
might organize perl libraries that I'm installing on my local
userspace on webquarry.  I will subsequently wonder about upgrading to
new versions of software..  Oh and that makes me notice an interesting
thing; I have some libraries installed in my web cgi-local directory
that don't need to be there.  They aren't accessed via http; only
smtp.</p>

<p>I wonder if I can move them without breaking anything.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Bell dinged; lunch is over.</p>
