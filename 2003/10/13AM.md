<p class=date>4:13am JST Monday 13 October 2003</p>

<p>It's super early and I'm awake.  I've got to go back to bed or I'll
be too tired when it comes time to get up for real.</p>

<p>Yasuchika wants to get a job in IT in the US, but doesn't want to
make his situtation worse.  I've tried to encourage him to get through
his fears, but I don't want to push him where he's not comfortable or
safe.</p>

<p>I need to follow my own advice and shake things up just a bit.</p>
