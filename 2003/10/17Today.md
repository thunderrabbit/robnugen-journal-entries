<p class=date>12:16am JST Saturday 18 October 2003</p>

<p>I cried today after class with Ayana.  I cried a bit on the way to
work, and cried a bit when I first got to work.  Morag came in, "how
are you?"  "sad."  and I told her I felt like I don't have any friends
in Japan.  She said that she was my friend, didn't that count?  and I
was like, "yes, totally," and a bit later she was all, "oh, I don't
want you to be sad."  and I said "sometimes I just need to be sad."
And she was all, "okay" and it was all cool.  Tears a bit longer and
she acknowledged that it sucked being alone (for her to be in Scotland
all alone) and she described (mirrored) what I'm experiencing here:
though I feel like I don't have friends, I've got to fix up my
emotions before I can feel like hanging out with anyone to make
friends with them.</p>

<p>I felt a lot better after crying.</p>
