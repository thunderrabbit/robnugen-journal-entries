<p>janette saw that I took a photograph of a cute blonde while we were
in Kyoto and now we are breaking up.</p>

<p>What a dumb photograph.  Can't even fucking see the girl in it
except that she's blonde.  What a dumb idea to take her photo.
Fuck.</p>

<p>We talked about it, and it seems that I don't want to have a
girlfriend because I want to do everything alone.  I love having
breakfast lovingly made for me, but I want to learn how to do it
myself.  I want to rely on <em>no one</em> but myself.  Is this
lunacy?  Must we always rely on others?  What about people living off
the land?  Must *I* always rely on others?</p>

<p>I want the world to take care of me.  The world to make me
breakfast.  I want to have done amazing things in the world.  I want
the world to be amazed.</p>

<p>I have offered janette my continued friendship, and a place to stay
while she is in Japan.</p>
