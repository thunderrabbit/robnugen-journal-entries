<p>Have just visited the Hiroshima Peace Museum and the other thing
honoring the deceased and..  wow.</p>

<p>Hey Bush, before you unsign the anti-nuke thing, maybe you should
come visit Hiroshima.  That bomb was fucked <em>up</em>.</p>

<p>Did you know there was 50 kilos of uranium in the bomb that fell,
but only 10 kilos actually detonated?  I didn't.  This shit could have
been five times more destructive.  Damn.</p>

<p>Certainly newer technologies would be less likely to waste 80% of
their payload.  Just how much uranium is planned per detonation these
days?</p>

LOTS of little kids from elementary to senior high are out here.
Many are running amok.  janette and I watched a ceremonial offering of
folded paper cranes to the outdoor paper crane display.  Probably 1000
paper cranes were presented by this elementary class.</p>

<p>Soon as they were finished, the next elementary class began their
ceremonial offering of 1000 paper cranes.</p>
