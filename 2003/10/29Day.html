<p>Well the good thing: I'm beginning to remember what time the train
will come.  I knew <em>I gotta be at the station before ten oh
oh</em>.</p>

<p>The not as good thing: I didn't make it.  I missed the train by 3
minutes and have to wait 5 minutes for the next one.</p>

<p>Idea: don't cut it so close.</p>
