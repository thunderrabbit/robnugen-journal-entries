<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I just sorta kinda talked with a computer to cancel my magazine
subscription.  It was pretty much able to understand everything I said
except when I coughed or dropped the phone.   Couldn't quite parse
that correctly.</p>

<p>Two amazing things:</p>

<p>1) they offered me a year subscription to Popular Science for $4.
Four dollars.  They've got to be taking a loss on that!</p>

<p>2) I was talking to a computer.</p>
