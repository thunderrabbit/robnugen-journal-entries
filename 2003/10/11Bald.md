<p>On the way out of work, I said bye to Junko.  She was like, "why
did you shave your head?" and reached up to fuzz it.</p>

<p>I was like, "cause it's easy to take care of.  You should shave you
head too.  It would look cool."</p>

<p>"My?" pointing to herself.</p>

<p>"Hai.  We can just buzz it right off tomorrow.  I'll bring my clippers."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Then I can't catch the boyfriend."</p>

<p>"Mmmm.  Okay. <em>I'll</em> be your boyfriend if you shave your head."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Yes.   Okay, if you shave your head I'll be your boyfriend until
it grows out and then we can break up.  It will be great."</p>

<p>" ... "</p>

<p>"See you tomorrow."</p>
