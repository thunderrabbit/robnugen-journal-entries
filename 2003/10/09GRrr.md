<p class=date>5:29pm JST Thursday 9 October 2003</p>

<p>We just now got on this backwards going train and I ripped my
shorts sitting down.  Gah.  These are the shorts that janette
painstakingly converted the broken snap into a working button and now
they're ripped in the back.  Stupid fuckin' grr grr grr.  I don't want
janette to leave and I don't want to have ripped my shorts and I don't
want to go to work tomorrow.</p>

<p>And these aren't just a pair of my standard Utility brand cargo
shorts.   These are the zip-off-legs cargo pants that Wende bought me
some time ago.  Really light fabric that I think will be fucked up to
mend neatly.</p>

<p>Well, if janette misses her flight, she'll have time to mend these
shorts.</p>

<p>C'mon train, let's *go* already.</p>

<p>Got off at Terminal 2, where I picked up janette.  Talked my way
past the screener (I'm carrying her shiznit, geatch) and went up three
sets of escalators ("I think I'm going to make it."  "Me too.  I'm
really happy about that.") to the departure area.  Info counter:
"wrong terminal, jack."</p>

<p>FUCK.</p>
