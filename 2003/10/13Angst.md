HI Kim

I am up in the middle of the night thinking about my life situation.

Am having trouble discerning why I'm here in Japan, what I should
focus on.

Original goal:   Learn Japanese, then lead youth group tours to
Japan.    (This is part of a bigger dream of leading tours around the
world)

Different goal:  learn four languages by 2010 (arbitrary goal set to
better myself (as I judge knowing multiple languages is cool)  )

What I want:   to feel loved and free and beneficial to the world

Amazing idea I would love to do:   ride my bicycle around Japan and
Asia, just for the experience

Amazing idea that my ego wants:   become historically famous to Japan
by bringing mkp to Japan, thereby helping to change Japanese culture

What I want:   not have to fucking worry about money

Thorns in my side:  unfinished projects like 100s of emails in my
inbox, haven't written a mass email update lately,  not many pictures
on my website,

Sigh.   Thanks for listening.

I would love feedback from you.
