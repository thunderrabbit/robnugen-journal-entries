<p>I'm not really good at playing Grand Theft Auto 3, but I found that
I can stand on cars which will subsequently drive around the city with
me standing on them.  Some cars drive more aggressively than others,
so my character will get jostled off, but some are stable enough that
I can just ride around until there's a car-ramming traffic jam
resulting in over jostleage.</p>

<p>I thought it would be a cool thing to ride around up there and
shoot things, like in a particularly sweet (if by sweet I mean
violent) scene in _Swordfish_ starring John Travolta.</p>

<p>I looked up <a
href="https://www.ps2-cheats-codes-games.net/GTA3_Cheats.htm">cheats</a>
for the game and found All Weapons. But I'm not able to aim (I don't
know if it's my lack of skills with the game, or if it just can't be
done from on top of a car) and shoot up stuff like I'd hoped.</p>
