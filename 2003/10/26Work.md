<p class=date>3:37pm JST Sunday 26 October 2003</p>

<p>Workin' at KQ today.  Had Kyouko man to man.  She's unsure of
herself in level 5 lessons.  I'm quite sure of her, so I'm unsure of
what to teach her.  But then she didn't do amazingly well at a rather
difficult lesson so I guess there is stuff I can teach her.  I'm most
unsure of what's in her brain, what I have to work with.</p>

<p>11 more lessons until my weekend!</p>

<p>8 more lessons until my weekend!  Amazing how time flies when
discussing something that's already happened.</p>
