<p class=date>1:11am JST Tuesday 14 October 2003</p>

<p>No fruit on the perl tree, but as of tonight, I'm published on
rcdb.com!  I took the 3rd and 4th pics for <a
href="https://www.rcdb.com/installationgallery1193.htm">Hamu-Hamu
Ouku</a>.</p>

<p>After the quick response by Duane of rcdb, I sent him a couple more
pics (of Fujiyama) and have decided to zoom to Yomiuriland on
Wednesday to check out <a
href="https://www.rcdb.com/installationgallery1218.htm?Picture=1">Bandit</a>,
which appears to be a pretty rockin' coaster!</p>

<p>I'll take some super high quality pics of stuff there and will be
able to use that in my book.  Sweet!</p>

<p>Okay. bed bed bedtime.</p>

<p>Got to be up in not so long to attend Japanese class.</p>

<p>I have 1013 yen to last through tomorrow.</p>

HEY!  I CAN TELL YOUR PRETTY BUSY OVER THERE IN JAPAN.  BUT I AM BORED AT SCHOOL, WAITING FOR THE TIME TO PASS.  WE HAVE A TEST IN ART HISTORY NEXT WEEK SO WE DONT HAVE CLASS THIS WHOLE WEEK.  WHICH MAKES NO SENSE, SHOULDNT YOU REVIEW INSTEAD OF NOT HAVING CLASS???????????  BUT SO MY NEXT CLASS ISNT UNTILL 1 BUT ITS A COMPUTER CLASS..WHERE SHE JUST CLICKS THROUGH THE LESSON IN 20 MINUTES THEN WE LEAVE...SO I DONT THINK ITS WORTH MY TIME<br>
<br>

I HAVENT BEEN GOING TO ECONOMICS.  WANNA TEACH ME?  OHHHHHH ON MONDAY, I SKIPPED BOTH ECON. CLASSES (MICRO-MACRO) BECAUSE IT WAS COLUMBUS DAY AND I THOUGHT IT WASNT FAIR THAT EVERYONE ELSE HAD OFF... AND I HAD A TEST IN MANAGEMENT AT 1130 AM SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR THE DAY.  WELL, I GO TO CLASS ON WED AND MY MICRO ECON TEACHER WAS ALL "I AM SO SORRY I HAD TO MISS CLASS ON MONDAY, SOMETHING CAME UP AND I HAD TO GO OUT OF TOWN, SOOOOOO SORRY"<br>
<br>
AND I WAS ALL WOHHHHOOOOOO I GOT LUCKY!  AND IN MACRO, WELL I DONT ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THE LADY, SO I DIDNT REALLY MISS ANYTHING...  :)<br>
<br>
AT WORK, WE ARE DOING THIS PROMOTION FOR BROTHER BEAR....AND WE ARE MAKING A CAVE OUT OF CHICKEN WIRE AND PAINT AND STUFF...ITS GOING TO BE cool!  ITS MY IDEA AND SUCH AND ITS TURNING OUT GREAT!<br>
<br>
I AM THINKING ABOUT PUTTING UP MY CHRISTMAS TREE...BUT WITHOUT DECORATIONS, JUST THERE IN THE CORNER, QUITE LIKE A TREE.<br>
