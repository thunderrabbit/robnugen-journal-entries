<p class=date>5:02pm JST Tuesday 21 October 2003</p>

<p>Class was a bit better this week than it was last week.  I could
swear that Kobayashisan (now this is a different Kobayashisan than the
one mentioned earlier today.  This Kobayashisan is Chinese and knows
no English) was flirting with me.  She would occasionally look into my
eyes and smile as I was fucking up slash not understanding the
Japanese in the class.  Flirting?  Sympathy?  And during break we were
(actually they were (they = Grace and Kobayashi, both women, both from
China) and I joined them) looking at videos for loan and she leaned
her leg against me.  Damn I'm desperate for any kind of contact.</p>

<p>After class, though, poof; they both left with no fanfare.</p>

<p>After after class, I gave Morisan the key to her bicycle and tried
to comprehend her Japanese questions.  Thanked her thoroughly for the
use of the bike.  Wonder if I should have gotten her a gift of thanks.
Probably would have if Koko and I were still hanging out.  Or even if
she would simply return any of my attempted contacts.  (phone, email,
hand delivered letter (via her mom))</p>
