<p>I have just yammered with janette for an hour.  I spilled my guts
about Japan as a practice session for talking to Kim.  Not like
nervous, but just getting my thoughts aligned.</p>

<p>Overview: Learning Japanese without a girlfriend here seems
fruitless and difficult. ( "Getting a Japanese girlfriend is the best
way to learn." )  The original reason I'm here is to learn Japanese
enough to liase between American youth and Japanese host families for
2 weeks at a time.  That means I gotta know hella Japanese.</p>

<p>A different reason I could be here is to learn all that I've
learned and to ride / take pictures of rollercoasters here.</p>
