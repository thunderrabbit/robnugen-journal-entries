<p class=date>8:13pm JST Saturday 4 October 2003</p>

<p>Went to a river.  Saw no monkeys.  Ate vanilla and green tea softo
cream.  Did see three guys in truncated kayaks.  Saw some babies tears
moss.  Surprise/spider lillies.  Saw a giant tent that turned out to
be white sheeting hiding a well tower.   Ate om rice at a little
out-of-the-crowd cafe.</p>

<p>The train going back was cheaper, faster and less crowded than the
bus going there.</p>
