<p class=date>11:18am JST Friday 10 October 2003</p>

<p>Lesson with Ayana included me vaguely describing mostly in Japanese
my trip with janette to Hiroshima and Kyoto (and oh yeah, Nara, my
favorite of the three) and then talking to her about bringing mkp to
Japan.  She says there is a need for such, but Japanese are taught
that "yeah, we're all sad, why do you have to tell anyone."
basically.</p>

<p>Idea is to contact some counselors in Japan to get some ideas.</p>

<p>Then vocab vocab - learning go straight, turn left/right at the
first/second light/corner, three/four/five cornered figure (not
equilateral), circle, left side of the street, inside, outside.  Whew.
Enough for a week.</p>
