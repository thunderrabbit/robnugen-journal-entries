<p class=date>9:09am JST Tuesday 14 October 2003</p>

<p>Class was quite challenging for me today.  Three students total:
two of the students were Chinese women who know kanji, two of the
students knew English</p>

<p>(this grammar is fucked up.)</p>

<p>Anyway, they were yammering in Chinese at times, and it seemed they
were yammering in Japanese at times (but if so, why are they in the
class?) but then other times they were making errors that I could
detect.</p>

<p>I missed the last two classes due to fucking around with janette so
I hadn't done the homework.  I could barely keep up with them reading
the questions, much less come up with the answers.</p>

<p>Is this (studying) a path I want to continue?</p>

<p>I keep hearing in my mind Nami saying, "please don't give up."</p>
