<p>Woah.  That was close.</p>

<p>The train looked like a normal Toyoko line train (same interior and
exterior), but the map on the interior was different than I'm used
to.  (I didn't *look* at the map, but saw it for some reason)</p>

<p>We stopped on the wrong side of Jiogaoka station, given that it was
a local train, and some peeps got off.  I was like, "err?" and asked
the cat next to me, "shibuya ikimaska?"</p>

<p>"ikimasen" and he pointed to the other side of the platform.</p>

<p>"uh oh." Oh shit, and I got up and barely made it out the door.</p>

<p>Yay!  I escaped the wrong train just at the last second!</p>
