<p>There is a point inside my head from which thoughts originate.
Different than my ego's thoughts.</p>

<p>I have considered this point my connection with my angels, my inner
voice.. my true guidance.</p>

<p>This voice gives me the answers almost before the questions are
generated.  Like the thought form is formed, but before it is even
translated into English, the answer comes and *the answer* can be
translated before the question is translated.</p>

<p>Almost feels like I can see the thoughts come into my mind.</p>

<p>It seems to have been a year since I've connected with this voice.
I am thankful for its guidance.</p>

<br>so--- what did it say? we who love you want  to know what he whom we love has to say to said love.<br>
  seriously, did you get some guidance in answer to your angst-driven query(what am i supposed to be doing?)?<br>
  i am curious.  what has kept you from connecting with this voice for a year?<br>
  i am glad for you that you have access to your Self.  that you have the ears to hear.<br>
   your journal entries seem to be building(there are more frequent references to your feelings of restlessness and confusion) to....an eruption? explosion?small quiet answer? decisive action?<br>
   i had forgotten that your seminal want was to be a tour guide.  dude!  that's a great idea.  still.  isn't it?   you could get paid to travel with young people.  what's wrong with sticking to that plan?  i know you know how to get around, prepare,take charge.<br>
  as for mkp, what if you gave yourself one year to decide on the wisdom of that?  would that take the pressure off?  maybe something less gargantuan, yet as beneficial to you and the world, will present itself. <br>
  please forgive me if i am speaking out of turn. (whose turn was it ,anyway?)
