<p>The hotel staff woman correctly told me how we can get to
Starbucks, where I bought for Carla at work a mug that says Hiroshima.
janette didn't want to buy / eat / drink anything.</p>

<p>I've got a bit of a headache now, but we're going to go eat to see
if that helps.</p>

<p>All the walkin' with no water today probably was a big factor.</p>
