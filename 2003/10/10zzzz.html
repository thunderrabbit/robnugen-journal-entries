<p>Rode the train home with Morag after work.  Chatted with her, got
an overview of her life history.  From Scotland but raised in Canada.
Went back to Scotland for three months to waitress, then home for five
weeks and now out here.</p>

<p>Hung out with Miki in Musashi-Kosugi after that.  With a little bit
of thought, we were able to come up with 40 kanji that I know!  That
includes yama, kawa, 1-10, Sun-Sat, up, down, stop, gate, eye, big,
white, Tsunashima, Kawasaki, tree, wood, forest, person, left, right.
Oh, one more that we didn't think of while there: inside.
Awesome.</p>

<p>Came home, did two loads of laundry, shaved my head.   Bedtime.</p>
