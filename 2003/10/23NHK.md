<p>I wonder if I would enjoy slash can get a job at <a
href="http://www.nhk.or.jp/englishtop/">NHK</a>, a locally broadcoasted
Japanese TV station slanted toward education.  I'm interested in it
for language learning purposes and getting away from Nova purposes.
And for something really new and different purposes.</p>
