<p>[mope]</p>

<p>I am <em>JUST</em> arriving in Shibuya (the train ride is long
enough that I've been able to write the previous two entries) to see
Fumi when she texted me:</p>

<pre>
つぎの　かようび

きょうまで　おやすみ
ですね。　らいしゅう
の　かようびに　しぶ
やで　まっています。
ふみ
</pre>

<p>Sorry, jack, I can't meet you till next week.</p>

<p>(except written politely and in hiragana)</p>

<p>She is stuck at work, or so I understand from subsequent messages,
which sucks for her I know.  I guess she waited until the last minute
to see if in fact she could meet me, but cannot.</p>

<p>At least:</p>

<p>!) I didn't go through the turnstiles at Shibuya</p>

<p>@) I got to write on the way here</p>

<p>#) I get to write on the way back</p>

<p>$) this is my worst problem right now</p>

<p>%) I got to hear a funny story</p>
