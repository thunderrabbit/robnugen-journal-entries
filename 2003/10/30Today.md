<p>Woah</p>

<p>I haven't journaled in days.  Well a day.</p>

<p>I rode my bike to work.</p>

<p>Met a girl (Tomoko) in voice room who loves rollercoasters.  Wonder
if we can go ride sometime.</p>

<p>Got a letter from Steffers (whoohoo), and two notices of packages
from janette!!  Whooooohoooo!</p>

<p>The girls are being REALLY loud outside tonight.  Really
inappropriate and inconsiderate.  Obviously no YRUU upbringing
here.</p>
