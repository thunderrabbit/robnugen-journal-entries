<p>WOW!</p>

<p>We just had a premium earthquake.</p>

<p>I felt it before Frank or Peter.</p>

<p>"Earthquake dude."</p>

<p>There was vertical bububububu up and down for a few seconds and
then wubbawubbawubba back and forth, with the hanging lampshades
swinging gently and the door moving back and forth and even the US and
English flags shaking on the TV.</p>

<p>"We're on the ground floor and this shit is shaking.  This ain't no
building swaying; this is ground floor kinda shit."</p>

<p>Really happy to have been on the ground floor for this one.</p>

<p>I wonder specifics on its origin.</p>

TOKYO: A moderately strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude 5
shook buildings in downtown Tokyo on Wednesday afternoon. There was no
immediate word of damage or injuries.

There was no worry of tsunamis, potentially dangerous waves triggered
by seismic activity, the Meteorological Agency said.

The quake was centered just northeast of Japan's capital in Chiba
state about 50 miles below the earth's surface, the agency said.
  
Chiba prefectural police spokesman Yoshio Nakadai said there was
vertical shaking for several seconds, but no immediate reports of
damage or injuries.
  
Public broadcaster NHK reported that bullet trains departing Tokyo
were suspended due to a power outage to the rail system. There was no
word about power outages elsewhere in the city of 12 million people.
