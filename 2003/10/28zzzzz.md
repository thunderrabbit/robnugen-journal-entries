<p>Studied a tiny bit.  I've got to wean myself off GTA3 and
internet.  I've done well with getting off the internet recently.
Well, weller than before.  Matty is going to sell the TV and
playstation soon.</p>

<p>50,000 yen for big TV and PS2 and games and VCR and Sopranos VHS
tapes (purchased, not recorded from TV).  Huge deal.</p>
