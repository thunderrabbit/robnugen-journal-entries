<p class=date>5:12am JST Wednesday 1 October 2003</p>

<p>Knotted stomach.  Will we make our flight?  On the train now from
Tsunashima to Yokohama.  Yay we caught the express train.</p>

<p>Still knotted.</p>

<p class=date>7:13am</p>

<p>Unknotting.</p>

<p>On the plane.</p>

<p>Starbucks is like fifty million miles away from the gate.  I
thought, "if we're late because of how far away Starbucks is I'll sue
Starbucks."</p>

<p>We weren't late, but just barely it seemed.</p>

<p>Not until we approached the gate did janette know we were going to
Hiroshima.</p>
