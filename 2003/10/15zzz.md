<p class=date>12:48am JST Thursday 16 October 2003</p>

<p>Tonight was a crazy filled night with Frank, Peter, Matty, Chris,
Gbenga (pronounced "benga"), Atsuko (pronounced "liz"), Megumi,
Daiske, Sorie and her husband at Korean Barbecue.</p>

<p>My head is a bit tired from all the inanity.  (not insanity)</p>

<p>Daiske sculled 2 beers, each in like 5 seconds flat.  Chris (a
Kiwi) encouraged it.</p>

<p>Peter has turned a new corner and hasn't had alcohol in almost a
month.</p>

<p>I tried to practice Japanese with the nihonjin.  They mostly
answered in English.</p>

<p>Daiske was really drunk and leaning over me for 15 minutes to give
a painfully slow and repetitive, otherwise 2 minute speech to Frank
about how Frank touched Daiske and such.  Quite endearing, but wow.
Quite long.</p>

<p>Liz finally got Daiske to say "until next time" and we parted
ways.</p>

<p>The westerners are at the river drinking and yammering.  I gave
Frank the tape recorder and 1/3 left of a 150 minute tape.  It is too
cold for me to hang with them.  Fucking freezing in my mind, but not
really freezing.  Like 55 degrees I bet.  Frank loves it; I don't.</p>
