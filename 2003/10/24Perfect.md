<p>I thought of the perfect name or the perfect thing to write in this
entry, but I forgot it.</p>

<p>Tonight after work I rode home with Morag and met her roommate Lisa
and chatted a bit and we plus one of their friends are going to see
_Kill Bill_ tomorrow night at Cinecitta.   It's the first movie I've
seen in a while here.  Nothing since... T3?  Pirates of the Carribean?</p>

<p>Morag and I studied a bit.  She correctly identified most hiragana
on my flashcards as I correctly identified most of the vocabulary.
It worked well for us, studying the same flashcards and different
levels of language awareness.</p>

<p>Really good to see that I have progressed; I can help a body learn
hiragana.  I know those answers now.  I'm practically flat reading
hiragana.  Well, I'm flat reading some of the more common sequences of
letters.  Spelling out the less common ones.</p>

<p>Yay progress!</p>
