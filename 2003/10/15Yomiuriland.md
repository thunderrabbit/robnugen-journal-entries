<p>I've got this perfect to do list, and on the list is hang out with
Frank, and the weather is nice so I want to go to Yomiuriland, which
would probably mean not hang out with Frank..   The problem seems to
be I want to go to Yomiuriland because "wow, rollercoasters, fun fun
fun" and for Frank I don't want to "miss anything," as he'll be here
only one day.   Oh pooh.</p>

<p>I don't know if YUL is open today or how much it costs.  <a

<em>Japanese</em>.</p>
