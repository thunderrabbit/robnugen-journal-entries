<h1>State of My Life</a>

<ol type="I">
<li><p>Yesterday, on the day I planned to visit Hakkeijima Sea Paradise, it
rained.   Today it's sunny (even warm) (and I'm wearing a long sleeved
shirt cause it was cold yesterday).  The two weeks before yesterday it
was sunny (not counting my previous weekend, when it rained).  This
seems to epitomize my experience in Japan lately.</p>

<p>Blarg.</p>

<p>How can I complain?  I'm in Japan for goodness sakes.</p>

<p>There's something underneath this.</p>

<p>* I came to Japan to study Japanese.</p>

<p>* Actually I came to Japan so I could learn the culture (language)
well enough to interface between American youth and Japanese host
families.  I can learn Japanese that well, but I'd have to stay here
for a while.</p>

<p>* I don't want to stay here that long away from janette.</p>

<p>* The only way I'd be (wow the *only* way?) happy here is if I had
a girlfriend here.  Someone to hug on every day.</p>

<p>* I don't want to let go of janette to make a girlfriend in Japan
an option.</p>

<p>* BUT, I don't want to leave Japan and not have done cool stuff in
Japan.</p>

<p>* My plan now is to just do some fly things and then leave; get the
flock outta here.</p>

<p>* "some fly things" doesn't help me know when I'm done being
here.</p>

<p>I want to see:</p>

<p>. Niko (sp) (the place with monkeys north of here (scheduled for mid
November with my mom and Jon)</p>

<p>: Yomiuriland</p>

<p>; the haunted house at Fujikyu Highland</p>

<p>= Climb Mount Fuji (a little bit too late (cold) in the year to do
it now)</p>

<p>3 Hawaii</p>

<p>Oops, I ran out of Japan things that I want to see.</p>

<p>Dude.  It sounds like I'm interested in getting the flock outta
here.</p></li>

<li><p>Basically I have learned some rudimentary Japanese and learned
how to usually successfully navigate the trains in Tokyo.</p></li>

<li><p>I seem to drive myself harder than I want to drive myself.  All
in the name of fufilling "doing something for the world."</p></li>

<li><p>to</p></li>
<li><p>be</p></li>
<li><p>continued</p></li>
<li><p></p></li>
<li><p>(not)</p></li>
