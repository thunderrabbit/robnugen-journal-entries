<p>Just spent 17 minutes on the phone with Rieko to figure out where
we will meet on the 29th.  Significant time was spent by our
conflicting beliefs of where we were supposed to meet (near which city
is this place), and the rest spent on my trying to comprehend her
Japanese.</p>

<p>She doesn't (seem to) speak slowly for me.  At least not all the
time.  She slows down sometimes, especially to spell things (station
names with which I am not familiar) and when I'm apparently just not
going to get it otherwise.</p>

<p>It's funny to hear her pelting me with Japanese and then using
correct grammar to translate what she said.   (report speech and all
that).  "I told you that we should meet at the front of the platform
in Yurakucho station."</p>
