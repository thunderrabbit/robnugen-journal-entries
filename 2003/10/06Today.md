<p class=date>9:57pm JST Monday 6 October 2003</p>

<p>Lazy day today.</p>

<p>Read couple chapters to janette.  Annotated a few images from our
trip.  Colored a canvas thing for janette.  Went for a walk</p>

<p>oh oh oh and we happened across the shinkansen tracks as we were
headed down a super steep hill it looked like something was coming UP
the hill *really* fast and I was like, eeep!  and then I saw it was a
shinkansen flying past and underneath us and then before it went by
<em>another</em> shinkansen went by the other direction.
WHOOOOOOOSH!!!</p>

<p>We hung out there for 20 minutes until about 6 trains had gone by.
Wow.  Shinkansens are *fast*.  ZOooooooooooom.  If Fred comes to
visit, I'll definitely take him to that spot.  Wow.</p>

<p>Walked to the corner store (not on a corner) and then across the
street to a park to eat our fruity jello treats.  Watched 7 high
school boys try to ride on a bike.   Twice they got four people on the
bike and rode around with little problem.  They could almost get five
people on it and ride around, but not for very long.   Basically the
guy in back had to run behind the bike until it got moving and then
jump and piggyback on the fourth guy's back.</p>

<p>Been reading comics from comics.com on my secret comic viewer that
bypasses all the ads and stuff.</p>
