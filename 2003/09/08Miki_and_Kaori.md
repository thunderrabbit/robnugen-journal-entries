<p class=date>12:57am JST Tuesday 9 September 2003</p>

<p>After work I went out with Miki and Kaori.  Dinner and drinks (OJ
for me kurasai) and yammerin' in English and Japanese.  Quite fun.
Kaori kept calling me Bill (cause that's who they usually go out with
(I think!)).  I ate five fried fish.  Miki was quite quiet until the
latter half of the evening.  I dunno why.</p>

<p>I told them that I hated Nova (though I love the students, and
really want to help them (if they will put forth some effort)), and
that Nova is good for students who won't initiate and for teachers who
cannot teach.</p>
