<p class=date>8:05pm JST Wednesday 17 September 2003</p>

<p>Yumi learned numbers today: thousand and million she already knew,
but billion and trillion are new.   When she gave me 780 yen to cover
my train tickets, she was all, "here is... five.... bill..five... tr.
five tri...  five tri wakanai..  five" and I helped her out.  She's so
funny!</p>

<p>The 8:00 Commuter Express is leaving Shibuya at 8:05 as I write.
(My computer clock is 3 minutes ahead of their clock)</p>

<p>I'm thankful that I'll make it to my meeting with Shin by 8:30
(assuming the train isn't further delayed)</p>
