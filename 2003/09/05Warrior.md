<p>I have heard that Japanese supress their emotions in order to show
their integrity of character.  I have heard that Japan has the highest
suicide rate in the world.   I imagine these issues are linked.</p>

<p>I believe the new warrior training has something that can help
Japanese release their emotions in a way that maintains personal
integrity while resolving internal issues before they drive a person
to death in front of a train.</p>

<p>Training for life instead of being trained to death.  Haha.  That's
sick.</p>

<p>I have written to my I-group and Kim Sawyer for encouragement and
ideas, etc.  This is a worthy task.  I feel pretty daunted by it.</p>
