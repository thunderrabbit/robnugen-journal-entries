<p>It rained today; there's apparently a typhoon coming.  OH, and we
had an awesome earthquake today!  It was the biggest I've ever felt.
totally hardcore awesome.  I've been feeling little earthquakes all
day yesterday and all day today.  Little tiny ones that make me think
"did I imagine that?"  Today I felt a little one again (while in the
break room) and was all, 'earthquake!' and then jiggajiggajiggajigga
the floor started shaking quite effectively.  It ruled.</p>

<p>Also, It sounds like I'm going to be doing a kids class.  I told
Steve et. al., "I'm not singin'," and they said, "you don't have to
for Juniors; they're too cool to sing."  Good.</p>
