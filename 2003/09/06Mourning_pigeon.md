<p>This morning in Musashi-Kosugi, I heard a desperate squealing
squeeching sound overhead.  A single pigeon doing a pigeon dance up on
the interior framework of the station didn't have any discernable
problem from my point of view.  Both feet were intact and mobile; both
wings were retracted normally.  I offered up a mental bird blessing
then got on my train.</p>
