<p>janette is in the early to mid stages of her Woman Within weekend
retreat.  I'm super excited for her and to hear all about her
experience.  I'm really glad that she and Mags are hitting it off
well.  janette will chill with Maggie for a couple days after the
weekend until the graduation thingy.  It would be quite interesting if
janette sells Maggie on the idea of attending.  I could really see
Maggie doing it as she's been doing a lot of personal growth stuff in
the last couple years.</p>
