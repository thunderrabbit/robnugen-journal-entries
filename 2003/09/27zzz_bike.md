<p>Wooooo</p>

<p>Awesome.   Put my bike together tonight and rode around with
janette.  Saw Jon M (who is living with Olivia and Jen for his last
few days in Japan) on the way out of Bell Wistaria.  My bike felt
weird at first, but by the end of the evening, while janette was stuck
in a median waiting for highway traffic to go by, I zoomed up over and
down the highway on the pedestrian ramp thing.</p>

<p>Supazoomed down the hill into Tarumachi.   It ruled.  I'm *really*
happy to have my bike here in Japan.</p>
