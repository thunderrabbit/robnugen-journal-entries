<p class=date>11:04pm JST Friday 12 September 2003</p>

<p>Today I didn't meet with Ayana; she has had to work toooo much.
She's been home 3 days this week.</p>

<p>Wrote email and read (and filled out) janette's test letter.   Will
send it back before she comes here probably.</p>

<p>Walked around with Stephanie after work.   Showed her Cinecitta and
that area; Tuk Tuk Thai food piqued her interest; she loves Thai.
Wandered around the CD store in Cinecitta complex and then up and down
the little night life streets.   I wasn't offered a massagie by any of
the women on the street, presumably cause I was with her.</p>

<p>Went to the arcade where we had the air hockey championship and
were just about to play a game when she felt woozie.  She's diabetic
and checked her blood sugar (insulin?). It was at 37 ("that's bad"),
so she ate a snack and we left.  She was a bit shakey and later said
that was the lowest she's been in Japan.  D'oh.</p>

<p>We're going to hang out and watch a movie tomorrow night.  I dunno
which one.</p>
