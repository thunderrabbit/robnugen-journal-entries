<p>brain is a blank slate.    Tossed a few texts back and forth on my
phone with stephanie.  she said hi in the middle of the night while I
was sleeping so I texted her back; I knew she had a doctors appt
today; wondered how that went.  This concept of Stephanie saying HI
from some thousand miles away gives me a hint of future things.  I
have stated that I'll know I'm in the future when I can contact or be
contacted verbally (and visually, but that's harder for me to imagine)
by any of my peeps in realtime from anywhere in a chat type way.  I
wonder if we could just speak and have a chat with similar parameters
to an AIM chat: users can walk away or whatever, making the chat super
slow.   verbal "hey what's up?" might be replied immediately or never
acknowledged or blah blah.</p>

<p>Stephanie seems to be doing rather poorly and likened herself to
the movie Girl, Interrupted, a movie which I have not yet seen.  I
don't really understand what might be going on with her; but I hope
she can feel better / normal soon.</p>

<p>Hey i didn't write a state of my life address this month.</p>
