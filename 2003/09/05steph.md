<p>"Um, Rob," in answer to "what's your name?"</p>

<p><em>Why my name?  ...  oh, cause Stephanie is more difficult to
spell.</em></p>

<p>Lots of similar thought patterns.  Nova bad.  Clear emotions good.
Marriage too soon bad.  Marriage when = ?</p>

<p>Pricking her finger doesn't hurt anymore.  The receptors seem to
have given up.  She's supposed to use a clean needle every time.</p>

<p>HahaAHAhahaahaaahhahaahhah!  That was a good laugh.</p>

<p>Art, Japan, culture, Blue Man Group, dreams, goals, past stories,
((religion vs) spirituality), changing the face of Japanese history,
"we're the Joneses," and then oh my gosh what time do the trains stop?
It's 12:30!</p>

<p>The clock at TGIFriday's was an hour fast, fortunately, but even
so, time seemed to have flown by.  Though we didn't get off work until
9pm.</p>

<p>I worked at Tsurumi and gave my email address to one student, but
not another.  Maybe should have switched it, given their levels.  7B
and 3.</p>

<p>Got on the same train she took from Kawasaki to Yokohama.  The
phone system didn't really work, but I saw her as the train was coming
to a stop.</p>
