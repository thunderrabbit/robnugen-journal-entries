<p>Awake still, watching Peter, Frank, Matty throw words and stories
around.  "So you're going to stay around.  Under the Mike Feifdom.
Soldier of Mike.  Soldier of Mike.  Soldier of Mike.  Gonna get you a
wallet, 'soldier of mike.'"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"Will you believe me, will you believe me, mate will you believe
me, that I have <em>nevah</em>, up until this point, that I have
<em>nevah</em> heard of Redbook?"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"I like Janis' father.  Gordon.  An Englishman.  A man from
England."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"I'm not talking about carrying a Holy Grail of shit, with you
rubbing my shoulders as I run in there.  I'm talking, I'm talking
about going to the bathroom and taking a shit and getting a little bit
on my finger; I'm not worried about it; there's soap, but get a little
bit of Frankie Greenagel shit on the finger. And then walking up to
the usagi all, 'oh what's going on, hey what's my schedule there, okay
well thanks very much; I gotta go.'"</p>

<p>"Matty are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Ready?"</p>

<p>"For the movie. We're watching _Fiddler on the Roof_.  _Fiddler on
the Roof_."</p>

<p>"Naw; I've got to get up tomorrow."</p>

<p>"I have to get up tomorrow too."</p>

<p>"What time do you have to get up?"</p>

<p>"Anytime I want."</p>

<p>"Okay then."</p>

<p>"Do I have to get up?  Listen.  Do I have to get up?  What's my
other option? Not getting up?"</p>

<p>"If it doesn't matter what time you get up, it's like not
<em>having</em> to get up."</p>

<p>".... .... Matty.  Comeon we're watching the movie."</p>
