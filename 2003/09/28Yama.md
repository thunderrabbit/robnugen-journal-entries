<p>Rode up a pretty steep hill next to Ookurayama station.  hey I
wonder if the yama in the name is a reference to the hill.</p>

<p>I feared for janette's safety wooshing down the hill on the other
side, but she was fine.</p>

<p>Quite a beautiful area.   I had been there once before, but then we
went left where I had previously gone right, and it was all new to
both of us.</p>
