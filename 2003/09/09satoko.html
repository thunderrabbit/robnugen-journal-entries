<p>Chillin' with Satoko in Freshness Burger over some shakes and a
donut; yammerin' about randomness and laughing at my erroneous
Japanese.  She looked at my speech a little bit.</p>

<p>Satoko says, "HI.  I don't like that kind of song.  I like this
place but the music drives me crazy." (actually I wrote most of
that)</p>

<p>"nuts, almonds. I can't eat. Maybe that's reason I don't like."</p>
