<p>When trains zoom past one another on nearby tracks, it sounds like
a <em>bang</em> rattarattarattaratta as the windows all vibrate.
janette and I are on the train now and she jumps each time it happens.
I've gotten used to them since I've lived here.  She said it was
thrilling.</p>

<p>Lots of thrills on the way home!</p>
