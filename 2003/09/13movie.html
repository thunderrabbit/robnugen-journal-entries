<p>Watched _Oceans Eleven_ with Stephanie at her crib.  Pretty good
movie.  I don't understand why the goons from the casino are still
following him at the end of the movie.  Okay I know why they're
following him, but why did the movie <em>end</em> before that was
resolved?</p>

<p>sigh.</p>

<p>Enjoyed chillin' with Steph, but her city smells like rotten.
(Thanks, Ralph Wiggum)</p>
