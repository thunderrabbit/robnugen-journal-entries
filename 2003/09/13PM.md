<p>Well, I found the *best* place to hand out tissues: at the top of
the elevator at Kawasaki station.  Mofos were just lining up to grab a
pack of tissues.  Okay, they were lining up to use the escalator, but
50% grabbed a tissue as they passed me.  Only problem is that I'm not
allowed to hand them out there.  Almost finished the entire bag before
I was asked to leave by a cop.</p>

<p>Moo.</p>
