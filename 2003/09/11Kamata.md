<p class=date>10:12am JST Thursday 11 September 2003</p>

<p>Early shift came too early today for my brain, but I got up anyway
and made it to Kamata 15 minutes before the bell.  Didn't shave today;
3 days of stubble goin' on, with the argument that for all the
students know, I keep it this way.  We're asked not to grow beards
while we're not on vacation.</p>

<p>My first student was (is) a no show.  Rock.  Nice way to start off
the day.</p>

<p class=date>10:54am</p>

<p>Second student cancelled.  Money. (*)</p>

<p class=date>5:26pm</p>

<p>Second to last lesson was two level 3 women.  I told them about my
idea of bringing the warrior training to Japan; maybe this thing can
happen where we help get a real dialogue going here instead of blindly
crashing the country into the cliffs.  Gave them my email address.
Keiko and Youko.  Talked about names at first and then shifted to talk
about me and then to my dream.</p>

<p>Youko seemed most impressed when I used the words "maintain
personal integrity" and "take ownership of my own actions."</p>

<p>Last student is a no show.  I'm so lucky.  :-)</p>

<p>(*) I didn't like the movie from which I imagine Frank got this
phrase.  I don't really like the idea of emulating Frank, either, but
he says it so much that it's kinda stuck.</p>
