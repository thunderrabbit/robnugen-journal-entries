<p>Scott took me aside and asked about the time I had my cellphone out
in a kids class.  I don't really remember it and I told him so.   Was
also in trouble for using a translator in class.  Bah.</p>

<p>pretty pissy mood after that for a bit; want to quit; why am i
here; what would it take for me to quit; etc.</p>
