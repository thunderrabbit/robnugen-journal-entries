Greetings Robert,

My name is M____. Through a very convoluted path of
rumors and faxes I found your website by request of my Japanese wife.
Journal entry 12:19 am JST Friday 26 September 2003 is making its
rounds! Apparently there is a pissed off mother who ready your
message and interpreted it as unprofessional.... unbelievable.

I've been in Japan eight years, and it still baffles me how bent out
of shape things can get over small things like celphones and
translater devices.

Anway, if it's worth anything at all....

I FEEL FOR YOU!!

Read your resume before writing you. I admire your objective, and
respect your background and activities. I hope we can open a
dialogue. I don't plan on being in Japan too much longer, but you
seem to be a very interesting person so I just couldn't resist writing
you.

Here is a little about me.. don't have a website to share with you,
journal or resume.... but this article kind of gives you an idea of
me..

* redacted * (they were 404 anyway)

Anyway, please this email between us...

Best Regards, M
