<p>I have memorized the first four lines of my speech!  That's about
20%, by my estimation.</p>

<p>Yesterday at Starbucks, I recorded Ayana reading my speech and
recorded most of the banter of my trying to slog through it.  The
recording has helped a lot.</p>

<p>I'm beginning to memorize the fifth line. It's rather long.   Gotta
get ready for work.</p>
