<p class=date>8:50pm JST Wednesday 3 September 2003</p>

<p>Fun lesson with Yumi today.  As a result, I'm late to meet Shin
again this week.  Unacceptable; somethin's got to give.  I don't meet
with her next Wednesday; maybe we can change our meeting day to
Saturday or something.  I am usually free on Saturday evenings.</p>

<p>It's not just that I was 8 minutes late leaving our lesson that I'm
late for Shin. In Shinjuku, the Yamanote line wasn't moving.  What the
fuck is up with that?  Two weeks in a row there's been fucked up
delays on the trains.  good thing is that I'm learning new lines to
get to the same places.  Today I used Saikyu line from Shinjuku to
Shibuya which was only 1 stop instead of 4, so it's faster to
"Shibuya" but there's a long walk to get from the Saikyu platform of
Shibuya to the main part of Shibuya.</p>

<p>I'm meeting Yumi on Saturday (in 3 days); maybe we can switch to
Saturday from now on.</p>
