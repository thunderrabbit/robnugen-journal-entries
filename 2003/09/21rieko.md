<p>So thankful</p>

<p>Riekosan helped me get through the first two <em>pages</em> (of
three) of my speech.  I've not memorized them, but have correctly
pronounced them and have been introduced to the vocabulary on both
pages.  She was really tired; I acknowledge her effort to help me.</p>

<p>I have nearly memorized the first six lines of my speech.  I can
pretty much zing through the first 3, slowly recite the fourth, and
muddle through the fifth and sixth lines.  The seventh line is a lot
shorter/easier than the previous two, so it is nearly a given once
I've finished the first 6 lines.  The eighth line is the final line on
the first page, and it's kinda sorta easy.  Easy as the second
line.</p>

<p>Second page only has four (long-ish) lines, so that will be easier
than the first page.   I'm practically done!</p>

<p>We ate dinner at a shabu shabu restaurant.   Hajimete for me.  I
kept thinking about No Pants Shabu Shabu, which Frank talked about a
lot on his last night.  I didn't mention my awareness of such a thing
to Rieko.</p>

<p>I'm really thankful for her help.</p>
