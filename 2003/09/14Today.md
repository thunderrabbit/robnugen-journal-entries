<p>Today I got a text message from Stephanie, who didn't come to work
last night.  She's in the hospital.  Yikes stripes!  I don't know what
the deal is with that, but I have just texted her for more details.  I
hope she's okay.</p>

<p>Nothing amazingly good today, but one amazingly fucked up thing
that I was asked to do: <em>count</em> the number of various types of
students that were on our schedule.  This is part of the Daily
Statistics Report, done every day.  Mate, we *count*, by hand, the
number of students (man to man 7C students; man to man kids students;
business students; toefl students; eiken students), from a piece of
paper that was printed by a computer!  How fucked up is that?</p>

<p>Stephanie wrote back, "I AM SCARED AND WEIRDED OUT"</p>
