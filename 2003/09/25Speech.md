<p class=date>12:33pm JST Thursday 25 September 2003</p>

<p>This morning I was on the phone with janette and I got a text from
Rieko.</p>

<p>おはよう！　いま、　ほんやのまえに　います。</p>

<p>I read it a few times, trying to interpret it any way other than,
"Good morning!  Right now I am in front of the bookstore."</p>

<p>FUCK!</p>

<p>"sorry; I gotta go."</p>

<p>Called Rieko and ended up going there, arriving 30 minutes late for
our 10:45 <em>AM</em> appointment.  She said it was after her work; I
assumed it was work during the day (evening) like mine.  Nope.</p>

<p>Got a lot of good practice in.  Awesome.  I have nearly memorized
the first three lines of the second page.</p>
