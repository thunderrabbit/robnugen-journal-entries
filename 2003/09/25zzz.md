<p>Good Nova-bashing tonight at the ol' 101. Dan just finished his OJT
today;  Matty and I traded punches at Nova's material.  Matty had a
bit more to say than I do; I think he knows the book more. Nah, not
really, but he was really funny about the fuckin' Everyday
Conversation lessons.</p>

<pre>
"Are you a foreigner?"

"What's that?"

"ARE YOU A FOREIGNER?"

"I'm not deaf; you don't have to yell."

"I'm sorry."
</pre>

<p>"Polish that turd for 45 minutes," concludes Matty.  "No thank you;
I'm not fuckin' doin' it."</p>

<p>I pick up janette in 13 hours!</p>
