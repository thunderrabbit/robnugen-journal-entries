<p class=date>11:00am JST Thursday 4 September 2003</p>

<p>I woke up to finish writing my speech and email it off to Ayana
before our lesson tomorrow.  Checked my email and had a message from
Ayana, who needs to cancel our lesson tomorrow.</p>

<p>Hm.</p>

<p>For some reason, the translation of this speech isn't going as
originally planned.</p>
