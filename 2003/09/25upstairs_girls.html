<p>Olivia and Jen came down after work today and used the internet
connection, laughed a lot as they tend to do, gossipy and reading
funny emails from their friends.  I went up to their crib and had a
couple liqueur-filled bottle shaped chocolates and took some pics with
Livia's new camera and stuff.</p>
