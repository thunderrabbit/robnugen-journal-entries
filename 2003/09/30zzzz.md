<p class=date>11:36pm JST Tuesday 30 September 2003</p>

<p>I know a day has been full or lazy or distracting or both if the
first entry is a sleep entry.</p>

<p>Rode bikes with janette.  My pedal <em>fell off</em>.  May need to
replace it sooner than planned.  7500 yen for a new crankset.  Sigh.</p>

<p>Went to Miho's with janette.  Mmmmmmmm.</p>

<p>Went shopping with janette.  She yammered with ..   wait that was
yesterday I think.</p>

<p>Read _Stranger In A Strange Land_ to janette.  Chapter xxxii.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Tomorrow (and by tomorrow I mean we have to leave in 5.5 hours)
we're going to Hiroshima (for one night) and then Kyoto (for three
nights).  I haven't packed.  Yay.   But I have made some preparations,
like purchasing all the tickets we'll need for airplanes, shinkansens,
hotels.  Have collected a few snailing addresses of peeps in Japan.
Not so many of peeps in US.  But email me your snailing address within
5 hours and I can send you a postcard.</p>
