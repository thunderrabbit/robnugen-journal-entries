<p>Ate at kaitein sushi then stood like excited kids at the front of
the train to Shibuya station.</p>

<p>The Shibuya girls were not out in full force, but we saw a couple,
and we saw a young man striding in a long black <em>crushed
velvet</em> robe over a black crushed velvet skirt and white button up
shirt and tie.</p>

<p>Dude.</p>

<p>Now we're in the Starbucks where I meet with Ayana most Fridays.  I
snuck janette in through the top back door of the facility, so she
thought I was taking her to some random office building and into an oh
my gosh where are we going oh hey it's Starbucks!</p>

<p>Heehee I'm so sneaky.</p>

<p>Holy cow.  I stood transfixed for minutes watching this guy do
tricks on his bike.  He could stand on one axel peg and use his other
foot to spin the wheel propelling him further.  This is equivalent-ish
to way-high level unicycling tricks.  But then he would spin the frame
of the bike around underneath his body, sometimes jumping over the
frame so only his hands were touching the handlebars.  He often
remounted the bike without touching the ground.  Once, he finished the
trick by standing up on the frame of the bike as it rolled backwards,
then sat down on it normally.</p>

<p>Wow. wow. wow.</p>
