<p>Gah.</p>

<p>I crossthreaded my pedal when I put it on my bike yesterday.  It
was crooked and I noticed it, but I thought the pedal was bent or
something else besides having been cross threaded.  Crossthreaded.
Oh.  I can fix that.  Took it to the bike shop, pedal off, pedal on;
now it's worse.  It went on straightly, but the threads are so fucked
that it's <em>loose</em> and not just crooked, but wobbly and crooked.
Could be several yen to replace the crank and pedals.  Fuckin' hell.
And janette just had one crank replaced (the other one, thank
goodness).  Shit.</p>
