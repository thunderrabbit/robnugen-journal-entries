<p class=date>12:17am JST Wednesday 3 September 2003</p>

<p>Japanese class was pretty diverse today. Rasumi was there, which
was cool.  She has distracted me from afar before and now I got to be
distracted right across the table.  She's got one dark tooth, but
everything else seems pretty optimal.  Physical appearance wise at
least.  Her Japanese seems fluent, but she says she doesn't know a lot
of the vocab.</p>

<p>Then another cat named Clark came in.  He's been in Japan for 2
years and just blows me an Olivia away.  Then another girl named
something else came and she also has more nihongo skills than me and
Olivia combined.  Very frustrating.</p>

<p>Hanging out with Fumi in Shibuya was cool; we found a toy store
with fun magnet construction thingies - remniscent of Tinkertoys or
Erector Set, but better.  Went to an Italian restaurant in the area
and chowed a thin crust white bread 4 cheese pizza and some leaf
shaped cheese covered pasta.  She told me that I was the only one of
five teachers to call her back when she looked us up on
englishteachers.com or something like that.</p>
