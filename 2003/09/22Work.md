<p>At work I chatted with two level 4 women, telling them my idea
about bringing the warrior training to Japan.  They approved.
"<em>Please</em> save Japan."</p>

<p>This tells me two things: she knows there is a problem, and she's
not ready to take responsibility for solving it.</p>

<p>I gave them homework:  "If there is a problem, say something."</p>

<p>Also gave them the <a href="http://www.mkp.org">MKP</a> website and
my email address.</p>

<p>In my last lesson, I taught a senior kid student (age 11 or so) and
taught him animal vocab (penguin, dolphin, hippopotomus) and classes
(mammal, reptile, bird, fish) and some of their similarities and
differences.</p>
