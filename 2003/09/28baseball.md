<p>Saw some little kids playing baseball.  Best thing: a single girl
playing competitively with all the boys.  She could catch anything
that came near her.  Worst thing: the umpire/parent throwing a
(rubber) baseball at (t)(his) kid when he hit a foul, then throwing
his glove at the kid on the subsequent foul. Then booting the kid in
the butt, knocking him down on the third foul.  Why didn't anyone say
anything?  Why didn't I go kick that guy's ass?  Stupid Japan.</p>
