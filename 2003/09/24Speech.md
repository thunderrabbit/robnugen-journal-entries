<p>It seems I've kinda given up on memorizing my whole speech.  The
agonizing hours don't seem to be worth it.  I can just read it in
romanji and have a much more relaxed time before and during the
speech.  I'm here to learn Japanese, not here to kill myself
memorizing Japanese that is too difficult for me to realistically
learn in such a short timespan.</p>

Subject: How are you?

To Rob

How do you feel today? I hope you are pretty good.
Today I brought you an old saying such as no pain no gain.
I'm sure 1000 キロ もの みちのり　を.... is one of hard phrase in your speech.

So read it loud please.

うおう　さおう　して　is your favorite
So enjoy it.

ジョンソンうちゅうせんたー...is almost same as English and your home town.
So no sweet.

You have more 4days.  Please enjoy your wonderful Japanese speech.
