<p>Sometimes I write least when there's the most to write.</p>

<p>Frank's going away party. I was impressed with the huge impact he
has had on the students.  Maybe it's just that one student owns a
restaurant.  But we got the party room in that restaurant.  Amazing
meal.   Not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom amazing, but
tons of sushi and pineapple and tempura and miso soup.  Fucking
sweet.  And karaoke.  And I got to speak a lot of Japanese with some
of the peeps there.  Yasuko, Yasuko, Atsuko, Saiyuri, Yoriko, Jun and
Daisuke, the owner.</p>

<p>Recorded a lot.  Got some sweet funny conversations.  May
transcribe them sometime this century.</p>

<p>I was envious of the impact Frank seemed to have.  I want that kind
of impact.  My going away party at Houston Rally proved my
impactfullness.  I'm falling asleep.</p>

<p>Went home and then went to the river and recorded a lot more.
Steve and Matty left early, leaving me, Frank, Peter, Chris ("Kiwi")
to yammer.</p>

<p>Definitely falling asleep.</p>
