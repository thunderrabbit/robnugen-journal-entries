<p>Bought batteries on the way to work so that I could have someone
read my speech so I can listen to it tonight.  Yoshie was leaving Nova
as I got off the elevator; I shoulda gotten on with her and had her
read it, but I balked and didn't (there was another student, which
made me uncomfortable with overt fraternizing).  During the day I got
Kaori's phone number and texted her to say I wanted help after Nova if
she happened to be available.  She didn't write back nor show up to
voice.</p>
