<p>Woah.</p>

<p>I've not tried it, but of course I've considered it.  Mostly I
don't think my granny bike could handle it.  There's a flight of about
10 steps, maybe 5 feet tall, that connects a back alley with the
higher grade (elevation moreso than quality) street near the bridge in
Tsunashima.  On each side of the steps is a smooth steep ramp for
bicycles to be pushed up or reigned down.</p>

<p>Today I was zoomin' behind a guy on a granny bike, mostly keeping
up with him through the people clogs (clumps, not shoes) on the
bridge.  After the bridge, he zipped over to the street and I was
like, "awright!" cause I've never seen another Japanese cat do that.
But then he immediately got back onto the sidewalk instead of taking
the street all the way to the light and I was like, "aw man what a
"but I was cut short when he cut across the sidewalk and vanished down
those steps!  "WOW!"</p>

<p>I wonder if his spokes are tougher than my spokes.  I wonder if
he's in enough control slash can see enough to not annihilate someone
planning to slash already using the ramp as he plans to engage it.</p>

<p>I look greatly forward to having my bike!</p>
