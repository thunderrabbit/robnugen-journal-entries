<p>Lesson with Yumi was hilarious.  Two hours like nothin'.  Well 1.5
hours like nothin, and I noticed the last 1/2 hour.</p>

<p>Filled 7 pages of notes.  Lots of laughs, funniest of which was our
closure.  She solemnly said, "thank you very much," as I solemnly
said, "arigato gozaimas."  Then she answered "you're welcome," as I
replied "doitashimashite."  Hilarious.</p>

<p>I'm falling in love.</p>
