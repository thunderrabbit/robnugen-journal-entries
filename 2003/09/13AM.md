<p>I haven't ready *anyone's* livejournal in a long time.   I feel
sad/guilty/? for letting that go.  That equals YRUU-connection.  Even
with my favorites.  I don't have the time to read them all, and I feel
afraid to miss something, or not "be there" for someone.</p>

<p>Maybe I won't say, "I'll always be there for you," but instead,
"I'll be here for you" or even, "I'll be here," but then I might move:
"I'll do my own thing wherever I am."</p>
