<p>I think this is the same terminal where I initially arrived.  Over
there is the Meeting Area where DruDaddyG and I first met, except
where we sat there is now a table with internet connected laptops on
it.</p>

<p>An arriving passenger greeted her friend with a lei, and I almost
cried at the idea of.... emotion?  care?  connection?</p>

<p class=date>4:28pm</p>

<p>I was just beginning to think dreadful thoughts.  I replaced them
with happiness, then suddenly turned around to see janette smiling and
resplendant behind a huge box carrying my bike.</p>
