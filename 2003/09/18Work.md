<p>Okay, very quickly, just in case I ever care:</p>

<p>Had my 6 month review's counseling today.  First Steve was all,
"I'll just be watching, not ganging up on you," but he spoke as much
or more than J-lo (Jon Lo) did, and I called him on it.  "I'm
distracted because I feel like I'm being tagged teamed.  Okay, what
was the question?"</p>

<p>The second 40 minutes included no Steve so that was a relief.  I
don't think I'll ever learn (care to learn) the Nova way of doing
things and I told J-Lo straight up that I'm not going to re-sign a
contract with Nova.  Steve later said, "well you can't just give up,"
and I'm thinking, "really?"  But we'll see what I judge is in my own
best interest from moment to moment.</p>

<p>Neil Hasagawa-Yates (sp) is the AAM (Assistant Area Manager?),
Steve's Boss, and he offices at Kawasaki now.  Today was the first
time I've talked to him, and he seemed more... down to earth than
cramming Nova down my ears like some people seem to do.  He had some
useless rhetoric, but somehow I was left thinking I could possibly
talk to this cat, even though he seems to be so far removed from what
we do in the trenches.  I know he's been through it all, but..yeah
whatever.  Okay, that I didn't *hate* N H-Y is what I wanted to
write.</p>
