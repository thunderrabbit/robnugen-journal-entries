<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>One of my students asked me if I am normally patient.  She was
(I believe) referring to the patience required to teach.  I think I'm
patient when I teach, but I'm not really patient in the rest of my
life.  I silently want to pass all the hordes of stone-faced Japanese
shuffling up/down the steps in the train station; I want my train to
be here right <em>now</em>; When I'm alone I walk in high gear all the
time.  I always try to optimize my path, not waste any time.
Continually have a dialogue in my head defending my decisions.
(that's a different story)</p></li>

<li><p>I have given my email address out to a bunch of students.
Probably 20 or so.  Almost all women.  But not for overt (here I am
suddenly defending my actions.  Why is it all women?   Cause I'm more
comfortable flirting with women than I am with men.  Cause I want
attention from women moreso than men.  Even though I want to bring the
New Warrior Training to Japan, I have spoken almost exclusively to
women about it.) sexual connections (what's optimal here; to stick to
my rule that parenthesis should be removable and leave a sentence
intact, or to make something legible in other contexts?   or just
leave it hanging cause I've gone so far off topic?)</p></li>

<li><p>I am now living in Frank's old room.  The tatami room in our
apartment at 101 Bell Wisteria in Tarumachi (between Tsunashima and
Okurayama stations), Kouhokuku, Yokohama (near Tokyo), Kanagawa, Japan
(small island east of China)</p></li>

<li><p>I've been working lots on memorizing a difficult speech in
Japanese.  I'm impatient to do that now.</p></li>

<li><p>Stephanie, my homegirl at Kawasaki, left Nova/Japan after five
weeks.</p></li>

<li><p>Oh, I remember the point of number 2 above: I have been giving
more energy to bringing the new warrior thing to Japan.  But the rate
at which I'm moving would make it a multiple year project it seems.
Fuck that.  If somethin's gonna happen, it's gotta happen now.  Or
close to now.  Sometimes I just throw myself at a project and forsake
everything else, but projects never (rarely) keep my attention for
long.  Seems that my journal has captured my imagination for the
longest time.</p></li>

<li><p>right now all my energy goes to the speech.  except for right
now when I'm writing and elsewise when I'm at work.   I'm really happy
that the speech will be over soon after janette arrives; I would hate
to be distracted by that when she is here.</p></li>

<li><p>janette is coming soon!   3.5 days.  Holy shit.</p>

<p>(in a good way)</p></li>

<br>hey!  i am reallly grateful i get to be there when you give this speech. <br>
 i suppose it will be like when i watch you climb a viaduct or a waterfall. i do not worry.  i know you will succeed and blow me away in the process with your mastery and power. <br>
that's one of the many,many things i love about you. success is your only fuckin option, failure's not.<br>
  and if you need to work on your speech while i am first there with you- well you just go right ahead.  i'll just take off my clothes and climb in bed and rub your...oh, sorry.  am i distracting you? <br>
 am i now?
