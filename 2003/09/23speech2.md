<p>Miki and Kaori get special thanks for their help with my speech.
Miki and I ate and speeched at a ramen shop (all ramen is hot ramen)
until Kaori arrived and we went to a Jonathan's in Musashi Kosugi.
Work work worked on my speech and made some headway.  They
alterred/trimmed it even more for me.</p>

<p>Egad what an agonizing night.</p>
