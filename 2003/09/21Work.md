<p>Work was kinda bad today; just... tsk.  Voice went from silent
stares to a guy saying the moon landing was faked (according to
someone he had heard) and that the US developed the technology to fly
to the moon to strenghten the US military.  It sounds likely, but
still I hate to have it shoved at me.  One cat defended the US,
reminding us that the internet was created originally as a government
project ( therefore not all US govt = bad ).</p>

<p>Fuckin' file system at work pisses me off.</p>
