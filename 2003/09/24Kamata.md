<p class=date>9:44pm JST Wednesday 24 September 2003</p>

<p>Gave my email address or website to about 8 students today.</p>

<p>Lots of level 4s and 3s today.  Lowest was level 5.  Actually the
lowest was a level 3, but officially it was level 5.</p>

<p>Gave mkp site to about half the students today.</p>

<p>Inquired several times about the idea of bringing mkp to Japan.</p>
