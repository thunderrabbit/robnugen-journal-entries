<p>Do you think it would be easy enough to send an email with a .jpg
attachment to a super secret email address
super-secret_jpg-processor@robnugen.com and have a perl script that
extracts the .jpg, makes a thumbnail, saves the original and thumbnail
to a directory on my server, and sends a URL reply indicating where
the files are and how much space is left on my account?</p>

<p>That would rule.  Fuckin' hell; I know it's possible.  I wonder how
long it would take me..... oooooooo and for the email reply to tell me
how much space is left on my account.  Sweet.</p>

<p>I'd pay 5000 yen for perl/.procmail code that does it.</p>
