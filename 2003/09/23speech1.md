<p class=date>5:18pm JST Tuesday 23 September 2003</p>

<p>Just spent about three hours grinding and drilling through my
speech with Atsuko, the Japanese woman who wants to be called Liz.
Definitely thankful for her time.  Definitely scared about my speech.
Definitely can keep charging through.  Went to Mister Donuts where
there's not a no-smoking area, but a no-smoking <em>time</em>; before
5pm it's no smoking.  She changed (simplified) a lot of my speech,
which bugged me at first, but jeez louise it's gotta be simplified or
I'll never get through this shit.</p>
