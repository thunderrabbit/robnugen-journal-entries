<p>Today is the first Saturday for me to work at KQ.  Last month I
worked there on Mondays and Fridays.  This week it's Saturdays, which
are super busy at Kawasaki.</p>

<p>Today was my first day to work at KQ on Saturday.  Kinda busy, but
nothin' like Kawasaki.  I had one free lesson during which I handed
out some Nova Usagi tissues and played Marble Blast.  The graphics are
so good (or so fucked up) on the game that it made me a little
urpy.</p>

<p>I'm on a train now to Shinagawa and then will zip over to Shinjuku
to meet with Yumi at Gateway 21.</p>

<p>いま　じでんしゃで　しながわに　行きます　それから　しんじゅくに　ケートウィー２１で　由美と会います。</p>
