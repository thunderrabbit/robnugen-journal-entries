<p class=date>10:28am JST Saturday 27 September 2003</p>

<p>janette gave me space to work on my speech, but I had trouble
staying focused.  Liz called me this morning to see if my speech is
okay and I just left a message back with her.  Hoso called me this
morning and said I need to be at the lounge at 9:45 (moved up from
10:10 (which I was just going to make 10 anyway)) at which time she
will help me (hopefully in a non-frustrating manner (I choose my own
reaction, but we'll see how genki I feel about my speech when I work
on it with her)) study for it.</p>

<p>I am the first speech giver.  Awesome.  If I feel like dying after
my speech we can just leave.</p>
