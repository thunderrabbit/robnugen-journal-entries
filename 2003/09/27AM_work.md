<p class=date>10:19am JST Saturday 27 September 2003</p>

<p>First person at work today = me (except for Sumika and Masayo).
That's good because I left a bit later than planned, in a bit of a
mussed rush this morning.  Super fast over the bridge.  Very short
waiting times at both train stations.</p>

<p>Legs a bit wobbly running down and up the stairs at
Musashi-Kosugi.</p>
