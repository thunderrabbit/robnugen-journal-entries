<p>In our lesson, Shin and I chose a new name for him in America.
He'll be..  wait. first I will say his *LAST* name is Shin, so I've
been calling him by his last name all this time.  Anyway, he was going
to be Harry, but I was like, damn G you can't be Hairy Shin, and I
explained why.  So we settled on Harry Davis Shin.  Nice.</p>
