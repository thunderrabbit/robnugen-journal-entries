<p>Finally.  A storm worth writing home about.  Still softer than an
awesome summer storm in Houston, but it could be considered a good
first storm of the summer in Houston.  Lightning.  Thunder. Slanted
rain.  Nothing outstanding.</p>

<p>People used umbrellas while walking in covered breezeways.</p>
