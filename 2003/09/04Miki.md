<p>Miki is a student who said she wanted to meet me.  I told her I
have a girlfriend and she still wanted to meet me so I emailed her and
was like, "I dunno who you are, but hi"  (I got her address from Bill
who said she wanted to meet me).  She said she would say "I'm Miki"
next time she sees me at work.  Today was that day.  <em>ah</em> I've
seen you.</p>
