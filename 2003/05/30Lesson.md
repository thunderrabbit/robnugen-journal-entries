<p>Awesome in my lesson today.  All the studying this week paid off.
Ayana was impressed with my progress, though I still don't think I can
really *talk* to anyone out in the world.  Getting closer.  Today I
studied stuff like "I slept 8 hours last night" and "I studied 3 hours
yesterday" and "The library is behind the theater".. Some other stuff
too, but I've forgotten.</p>

<p>I can see progress.</p>
