<p>Class was cool today; it was just Olivia and I there.  No
Karly-distraction nor Alicia.</p>

<p>One thing though is they use romaji a lot instead of Ç–ÇÁÇ™Ç», so I
try to ignore it when they write it.  I'll ask for Ç–ÇÁÇ™Ç» next time
as well.  Ç–ÇÆÇø, the younger ÇπÇÒÇπÇ¢ (%) seems more aware that I use
Ç–ÇÁÇ™Ç» instead of romaji.  I appreciate that.</p>

<p>(%) Just at that point the train stopped at a station, and another
train pulled up beside us (across the platform from us).  A woman saw
it, got off our train, onto that train, so I knew it must be an
express train.  I'm going to ÇÊÇ±ÇÕÇ‹, a super big station, so I knew
that an express would stop there.  I joined her and thereby skipped
like 6 stations.  Awright.</p>

<p>Right now I'm at ÇÊÇ±ÇÕÇ‹Å[ÇŸÇÒÇ± Nova, about to attend the voice
training.  Good stuff I hope.</p>
