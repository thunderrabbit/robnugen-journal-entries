<p>Oh, speaking of studying; at Japanese class today we had a new
student named Grace (can't possibly be her given name) from Hong Kong
whose native tongue is Cantonese.  She also knows Mandarin and seems
to know English pretty well. She has recently moved from Australia
(Melbourne?) to Japan.  Now she's learning Japanese.  Nice.</p>

<p>So anyway, talking to her I'm like..... Mandarin eh?  cause she
said that Mandarin is easier than Cantonese and is more popular.
Mandarin, eh?  Hmmmm.</p>
