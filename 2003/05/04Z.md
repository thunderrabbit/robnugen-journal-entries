<p class=date>10:47pm JST Sunday 4 May 2003</p>

<p>Instead of going to get my bike tire fixed, I studied a bit and
fell asleep a lot.  Dreams filled with the concept of learning
Japanese, trying to learn Japanese, bits and pieces of words floating
around in my head.</p>

<p>Woke up naturally <em>just</em> before Frank yelled "WHAT???" in
the other room and then the washing machine beeped its 10-beep "I'm
finished" alarm.</p>

<p>In my head I wondered "what brings you joy, Frank?"</p>

<p>Soon as I got into the room he was all, "I gotta ask you a favor;
when I lose I get really angry."  He's playing Sega basketball.</p>

<p>"So what's the favor?"</p>

<p>"Just don't comment on it.  Your predecessor had to learn the hard
way."</p>

<p>"Did you kick his ass?" I ask, thinking the question is ludicrous.</p>

<p>"No; I very rarely resort to physical violence."</p>

<p>Oh, well that's nice.</p>

<p>The .... apparent accuracy of this video game is pretty amazing.
Taking into consideration number of fans the various teams draw, and
using two announcer's voices, a voice for the local announcer,
players' voices, tennis shoe squeaks, buzzer horns, advertising in the
arena... wow.   Pretty far cry from Adventure for the Atari 2600,
which I think I could still play happily.  Maybe 1 game on the most
difficult level.</p>
