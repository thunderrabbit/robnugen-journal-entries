<p class=date>10:46am JST Monday 19 May 2003</p>

<p>Called Jackie this morning to confirm she got the NIN I sent her.
She had.  Rock.</p>

<p>Been half-lumpy half-studying this morning.  Flashcards rule.  They
help me bypass the word circus in my head my visual-vocal ability
seems more efficient than visual-language1-language2-vocal.</p>

<p>I now know 
<br>cat = ÅÀÇ±
<br>snake = Å÷Ç—
<br>mountain = Å‚Å‹
<br>ÅÕÇ≥Å› = scissors
<br>ÇŸÇÒ = book
<br>Ç‡Ç‡ = peach
<br>dog = Ç¢Ç 
<br>Ç©Ç≥ = umbrella
<br>Å‰Ç´ = snow
<br>Å§Å‹ = horse
<br>ant = Å†ÇË
</p>

<p>To obtain the list above, I went through the flashcards and first
wrote the first word that appeared, and then its translation.  Nice.</p>

<p>I'm running off to the internet cafe in a bit after I shower and
such.</p>
