<p class=date>5:46pm JST Sunday 4 May 2003</p>

<p>Pretty okay day at work.  Relatively straightforward.  Had one good
lesson, one great lesson, and one not so good lesson and one faux pas
in another lesson.</p>

<p>The great lesson was a man to man where she asked me specifically
for help with language to use as a telephone operator for a hotel.
She told me the situation and I gave her language like, "for the
safety of our guests, we cannot connect you unless you have their full
name or first name and room number."  and "if there is no answer,
please don't hang up and I will transfer the call to voice mail."  or
some shit like that.</p>

<p>She seemed really happy with the new phrases.</p>

<p>And she was really cute but she's too young for me I'm sure.</p>

<p>The faux pas was me bringing up this cat's daughter's birthday
tomorrow (which he had mentioned in a previous lesson) when the
current lesson was talking about manly subjects like Japanese loyalty
to companies.  But shit, he wouldn't speak up at all, so I tried to
connect with him about anything I knew.  Whatever.</p>
