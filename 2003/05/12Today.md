<p class=date>12:53am JST Tuesday 13 May 2003</p>

<p>Today at work everything went pretty well.  I'm at that stage where
I'm just basically there, doing my thing - not in super brain-overload
processing mode.</p>

<p>Talked to Janette who said the earthquake was reported to be 4.3 or
5.1, depending on the news source.  She asked about my new gaijin card
and I told her I'll get it in a couple days.  So I was looking for the
uber-important document to getting my gaijin card: my passport.  Right
now, it seems to be missing.   I'm not freaked yet, but I will destroy
my room tonight until I find it.</p>

<p class=date>1:06am</p>

<p><b>room status:</b> intact</p>
<p><b>passport:</b> found</p>
<p><b>me:</b> relieved</p>

<p>It was in the correct place almost.  I had put it in my undershirt
drawer instead of my underwear drawer.</p>
