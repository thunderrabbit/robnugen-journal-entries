<p>I don't really talk about my roommates much, but I don't really
hang out with them. Right now they're playing Sega (?) basketball
game; they've each been playing a certain team an NBA season.  Matty
is New Orleans I think and Frank is New Jersey.  Matty just got
crushed by Orlando, and Frank suggested that one of Orlando's players
in real life isn't as good as he's depicted in the game.</p>

<p>I'm glad I prefer studying.</p>
