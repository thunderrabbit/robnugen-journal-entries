<p class=date>9:33pm JST Tuesday 27 May 2003</p>

<p>Took a big ol' fat nap with my short hair and then studies katakana
for an hour.  I now know ÉA - Ém.</p>

<p>They didn't cut my hair with no guard, so I'm going to go shave the
shit off in the shower now.   Not going to fucking waste 950
yen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and not have short-ass hair.  Damn that
was expensive.</p>
