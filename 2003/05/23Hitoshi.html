<p>Met with Hitoshi and his girlfriend tonight.  They seemed nervous,
and claimed to be so.  I was all, "aw man, it's cool; don't be
nervous" and such like that.  I was a bit nervous so I told myself as
well and that helped.</p>

<p>Meeting went well; I told him 2000 yen per hour instead of 3000 per
hour which is what the findateacher.net site said I charged.   That's
cause he's my first private student.</p>

<p>We'll see how it all pans out.</p>
