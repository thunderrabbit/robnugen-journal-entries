<p>I haven't checked my account, but today is payday.  I'm glad I have
a journal, cause I had forgotten how much I planned to withdraw.  I
planned to have 55,000 yen in my wallet for the month, but I've got
45,000 yen.  I'll see how far that takes me and if I can make it for
the month on that.  I don't see a good place to note this information
so that I'll find it when I need it.  Some sort of trigger to say
"when I run out of money, remember to look _here_ for the answer."</p>

<p>Okay; that's it: when I run out of money, I'll check my journal for
the entry written on payday (the 15th) and see what it says.</p>

<p>I've got 48,000 yen and change (700 yen?) in my wallet.</p>
