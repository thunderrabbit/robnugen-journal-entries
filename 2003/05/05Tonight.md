<p class=date>8:36pm JST Monday 5 May 2003</p>

<p>I've been home from work for a couple hours; ate some somethings
and some something elses and a liter of OJ while reading the first
chapter of Paul Theroux's <em>The Kingdom By The Sea: a journey around
Great Britain</em>.</p>

<p>Now I'm working on some Voice Training Pre Tasks, designed to "get
me thinking about the stuff we'll be working on in training tomorrow"
in Yokohama.  This will be my first time to visit the Yokohama-honko
Nova.  My understanding is that honko means head office or
something.</p>

<p>I'm trying to get this done so I can sleep so I can get up and
study and attend class in the morning before the training.</p>

<p>Ben Folds "One Down" reminds me of me right now.</p>
