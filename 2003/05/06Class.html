<p>Class was cool today; it was just Olivia and I there.  No
Karly-distraction nor Alicia.</p>

<p>One thing though is they use romaji a lot instead of ひらがな, so I
try to ignore it when they write it.  I'll ask for ひらがな next time
as well.  ひぐち, the younger せんせい (%) seems more aware that I use
ひらがな instead of romaji.  I appreciate that.</p>

<p>(%) Just at that point the train stopped at a station, and another
train pulled up beside us (across the platform from us).  A woman saw
it, got off our train, onto that train, so I knew it must be an
express train.  I'm going to よこはま, a super big station, so I knew
that an express would stop there.  I joined her and thereby skipped
like 6 stations.  Awright.</p>

<p>Right now I'm at よこはまーほんこ Nova, about to attend the voice
training.  Good stuff I hope.</p>
