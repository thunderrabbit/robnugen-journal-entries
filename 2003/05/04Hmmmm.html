<p>I'm wondering about riding my bike to work and thereby getting
exercise and 'saving' money ('saving' because I've paid 1500 to get my
bike untowed and I dunno how much to fix a flat) versus riding the
train to work and having time to study Japanese.</p>

<p>If my primary goal here is to learn Japanese, then the choice is
obvious.</p>
