<p class=date>6:57am JST Saturday 3 May 2003</p>

<p class=dream>Drew Barrymore was over somewhere like a hostel with me
and she needed to do laundry and I lived at the hostel (had just moved
in) and only residents were allowed to use the laundry facilities so I
said that she could join me doing laundry and we could both say we
were new since I was actually new they could verify the story.  She
agreed and we didn't go immediately, but I went off somewhere else to
get my laundry and then realized oh I have a laundry date with Drew
Barrymore and I ran back and she was still there which made me really
happy, but then I woke up which made me really sad.</p>

<p>(I got over it)</p>
