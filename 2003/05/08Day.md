<p>Okay.  I've studied; I may be able to ask "may I park my bike
here?" when I get to the bike parking lot.</p>

<p>I will ask.  I can easily do it.  I persevere.  Whutwhut!</p>

<p class=date>1:09pm</p>

<p>Got my bike.  When I uttered my canned phrase, he didn't seem to
understand me.  Ah well, fuckit.  I did communicate enough to
understand the rules there.  A ticket vending machine sits at the end
of one of the rows; it seems likely that yesterday the guy was
pointing me to that machine, though I didn't understand what he was
saying.</p>

<p>Price for 24 hours of parking 100yen for bicycles and 130yen for
scooters.  No price set for segways yet.  Not that I've seen any
around, which I haven't.</p>

<p>So then I was like, "so, tell me, snoops, where's my bike now?" and
it took a while to get it across, but finally I was able to show him
where I parked, and where my bike wasn't and he was like, "is one of
these your bike?" referring to some over by their booth.</p>

<p><em>oh please, oh please</em> I hoped my bike was there.
searchsearchsearch yes!!</p>

<p>"Please pay two hundred en," they say en instead of yen.  Gladly.
Basically gladly.  What if I had found the bike last night and just
jacked it back from them?  Have they a system by which they would have
later identified it had I parked there again?  If I had found it and
jacked it last night, when I rolled up would they have been like, "hey
jack, you jacked that; jack it back, mac!" ??</p>

<p>Who knows.  Whatever.  I'm going to study some more.  I intend to
know the 12 verbs and conjugations Ayana showed me two weeks ago.</p>
