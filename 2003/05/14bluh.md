<p>For some reason I've got the bluhs right now.  I came home, came
and took a nap for about 3 hours after doing laundry.  I even ironed
(my version of ironing) two shirts.  It seems like after my nap I've
just been like meh about *everything*.</p>

<p>I've sortakinda cleaned up a bit of my room, but didn't finish
that.  I got sidetracked reading the Yokohama living guide and did a
little bit more laundry.  This time I didn't iron anything, including
a shirt which will be wrinkled when it dries and will need to be
ironed before I wear it, and I'll be like dammit why didn't I iron
this when I had plenty of time to iron it *and* when it was damp, a
perfect time for ironing?</p>

<p>^^^^^ that was almost enough to get me up to iron it, but I'm like,
sigh... have to get out the ironing board, turn on the iron..  like
every single thing is such a big chore.</p>

<p>Fine. fuck it I'll do it.</p>

<p>Time me.</p>

<p>Done.  That shit took 15 minutes.  It didn't seem like that long,
but I'm sure not any happier on the other end of it.</p>

<p>Outside I hear the drips of a previous rain.  Frank is just now
home from running I think.</p>

<p>bluh bluh bluh</p>
