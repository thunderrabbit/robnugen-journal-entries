<p>I officially ended my probation today.  It's a good thing.  Not
surprising, but still it feels good.</p>

<p>On the train, before we left the station, I got a call.  It was
Steve from work "Can you work overtime tomorrow?"</p>

<p>I said yes because he said it was at KQ (easy), but I had forgotten
that Dru invited me to go hiking with him and a couple others. I
didn't tell Dru yes, but d'oh.  that would have been fun.</p>
