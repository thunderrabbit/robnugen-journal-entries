<p class=date>6:27am JST Friday 9 May 2003</p>

<p class=dream>I went to some tourist attraction and Bryn was there
and I'm all "hi, <em>Bryn</em>!" and she goes "I don't want to
explain" so I ignored the gap in communication and asked how she's
doing.</p> 

<p class=dream>We were in some big hall with a huge golden flame in
the middle of the room.  Bryn was excited by something so huge and
nearly yellow so she ran down the steps to check it out.  I followed
her not quite as quickly.</p>

<p class=dream>As she gazed up at it, she noticed something amazing on
the wall - a reflection of Earth, but with the entire globe shrunk to
about five hundred dollars which you are about to give me right now,
he said.</p>

<p>oops I just fell asleep while typing and was dreaming again.</p>

<p class=dream>There was a huge image of the Earth about 30 feet in
diameter and featuring Australia which we were like, how can the image
be projected back onto earth?</p>

<p class=dream>We marveled a bit and then I told her how much fun I've
been having traveling, and she agreed and reminded me that's what she
told me in the first place back in the day.</p>

<p class=dream>I was like yeah and thankful to see Bryn again.</p>

<p>I don't remember what else.</p>
