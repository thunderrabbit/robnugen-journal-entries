<p>Work is at KQ today.  Easy.</p>

<p>Doug wasn't at KQ last week; he works part time and is here in the
evenings on Friday.  He asked who covered for him, and it took me a
second to come up with Rachel as the answer.</p>

<p>"Where were you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Eminem."</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Nice.  He told me a bit about the show, that the Japanese weren't
all that responsive and then I remembered why it took me a bit to come
up with Rachel's name.  I hadn't been here last week; I had gone to
training and then worked at the main office in Kawasaki.</p>

<p>That's why I didn't hit the show on Friday.   Pooh pooh pooh shut
the fuck up about the show.</p>

<p>Good thing is that by attending that training, I was able to level
up a girl today from 7C to 7B.  Ali and I agreed she could be LUed so
we gave her the LU1 and LU2 in two consecutive lessons today.  Rock on
for her.</p>
