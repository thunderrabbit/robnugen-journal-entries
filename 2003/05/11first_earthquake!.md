<p>Last night while at the internet cafe, I felt an earthquake!  But
the weird thing is that I didn't know at the time it was an earthquake
and I'm kinda pissed about that.  I mean shit how can I be mad at
myself for that?  Cause I didn't get up out of my chair to "confirm"
it was an earthquake.  I just thought it was some cat rocking the
flimsy cubicles for some weird reason.   I should gotten up and at
least felt the floor moving, since I wasn't outside to feel the ground
move directly beneath me.</p>

<p>So I didn't actually find out until today that it was an
earthquake. They were talking about it at work and Olivia goes, "tell
me you felt it last night!" cause, all emotions aside, it was a doozy
of an earthquake.  Frank said that people at his work were saying it
was the largest they've felt in 5 years of being in Japan.   And we
had another earthquake the previous day and I'm like "cool! bring 'em
on!" and Frank is like, "what? you're crazy man."</p>

<p>Olivia reports basically being worried about them, saying that
"they" say we are due for a major earthquake soon.  I'm excited about
the idea.  I don't want a bunch of people to die, but I like the idea
of safely experiencing something that makes world headlines.</p>
