<p>On the way to work today there were two young women on the train
with <em>ridiculous</em> makeup: fucking orange faces, with
orange/yellow/brown hair and with jet black mascara and one of them
had little mirror stars on her eyelashes and shiny silver-white smears
under her eyes.  The other had glitter on her eyelashes and was
putting on white smears below her eyes while on the train.  They both
had on tight skirts and tall-ish black heeled sandal-boots and maybe
fine white fishnet stockings.  Dude.  That was wack.</p>

<p>It may be the case they were going to ÇµÅ‘Å‚, which features some
strangely dressed characters.  Maybe I'll go people watch there
sometime.  I wonder if I could get them to pose for photos for my
book. (*)</p>

<p>Work was okay; pretty busy, but Scott helped me a lot with planning
lessons.  And, I must say, the well-planned lessons went more smoothly
than my normal lessons.  During OJT I was rather turned off of
planning lessons cause the whole operation was just so painful.  But
these planned lessons were quite less than painful.  Once they were
planned.</p>

<p>(*) what book?  I dunno.</p>
