<p class=date>7:19am JST Saturday 10 May 2003</p>

<p class=dream>Playing sports on a hill and as I slowly climbed up the
hill to my hotel I was collecting cheap balls and frisbees and such.
The frisbees were ultimate calibre and a guy bit me on the back as I
tried to get away with his frisbee but I started tohit him with it and
he let me go as one of his friends was all, "it's only a frisbee"</p>

<p class=dream>The cool thing about this frisbee - it was printed on
the underside instead of the top.</p>

<p class=dream>I got to the hotel and I had a nerf football.  A kid
was all coming up the hill and I gave it to him.  I walked into the
hotel wearing only underwear and I approached the front counter thing
discreetly and waved the guy over to me.  "Hey man; I know I'm not
exactly fully dressed.  But my clothes are all upstairs."</p>

<p class=dream>"We'll arrest you if you try to come in."</p>

<p class=dream>"No you won't; I'm just going to run up there and get
my clothes and sleep."</p>

<p class=dream>"It doesn't look like you'll be up very early."</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah I will; I have to be up at 7."</p>

<p><em>... be up at seven .... be up at seven....  seven 7 seven
seven..</em> Oh damn.  that's today.</p>

<p>Thank you brain for waking me up.</p>
