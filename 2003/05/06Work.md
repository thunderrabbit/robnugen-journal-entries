<p>Just now on the train after work and after chillin' at the kiosk
with Steve (!), Scott and Rich, some of the leader type people at my
school.  I dunno if Rich is a trainer, but Scott is; he was one of our
voice trainers today.  They traded some Nova gossip and drinking
stories, which were spawned after my explanation of why I don't drink:
"I heard all the stories in high school and I'm like 'why do you keep
doing it?'"</p>

<p>"It's pretty hard to explain," said one and went on to describe how
he basically gets drunk every weekend.</p>

<p>I also prefer saving money.</p>

<p>Anyway, work itself was pretty good and short; I saw cute Ç∂Ç„ÇÒÇ± in
a different classroom, but I didn't teach her.  After all the classes,
Å†Å‚ came in and told me that one of my students said I was very polite
and a very good teacher.  How awesome to hear!  I've never heard
anyone else get such a compliment; it made me feel quite good.  I'm
glad Steve was there to hear it as well, and he commented positively
on it.</p>

<p>Even though the comments I write in the files are not always
amazing, I always at least mark the files to indicate what lesson
number I have presented to the students.  According to Steve, not
everyone does this.</p>
