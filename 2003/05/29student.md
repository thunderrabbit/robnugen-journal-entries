<p>Amazing.</p>

<p>I got a call from Hitoshi, who said he chose someone else to tutor
him.  I told him thank you (I think I confused him with that) and
blessed him and hopes he does well, etc.  I didn't think to ask him
what made him choose someone over me, but meh; whatever.</p>

<p>20 minutes later I got a call from a new possible student named
Shin.  Rock and roll.  I'll meet Shin on Tuesday at 8pm in Kikuna.</p>
