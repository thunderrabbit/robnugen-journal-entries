<p>According to some very rough estimates, I spent 34000 yen over the
past 13 days.  That included 15000 for my train pass, so that's 19000
yen in 13 days for everything else I bought, most of which is food,
internet, phone calls to janette.  I can easily make it one more day
on 1000 yen (food only) or just survive on the groceries I have left
(4 eggs, 5 slices of bread, two little cans of tuna).</p>

<p>Anyway, it appears I can live for 2 weeks on 20,000 yen.  Therefore
I can live 4 weeks on 40,000 yen.  Plus my train pass.  So in a couple
days when I get paid, I'll withdraw enough so that I have 55,000 yen
in my wallet.  All but 10,000 yen will go to my home bank account.</p>

<p>I wonder how much I'll get paid.</p>
