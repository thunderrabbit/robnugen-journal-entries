<p>Wow!</p>

<p>Today during work; actually it was before work, but I was in the
building, I went to pee and suddenly I felt a tidbit dizzy and then
realized "whoah!" it was an earthquake!</p>

<p>I enjoyed this earthquake cause I was on a "stable" surface (the
floor of the building) and could clearly feel the slow shaking motion
maybe a couple inches of displacement on the fourth floor every second
or so.</p>

<p>I ran to the window, looking for other signs.  A large wire between
telephone poles was oscillating.  Felt another shakey shake and could
see it begin oscillating again.</p>

<p>Looked at a tall building some hundreds of yards away, but couldn't
discern any oscillation in the building itself...  but(!) I could see
on top of the building the boom of a crane was shaking.</p>

<p>That seemed to be it, so I went into the office all, "wow!  that
was awesome!"</p>

<p>Some people were scared, or think I don't have a sense of what the
damage could really be like.  "6000 people dead in blahblahblah" some
city and I'm like, "so?  How many people live there?  Six
million?"</p>

<p>Later, Eric/k said it was a magnitude 6 in some city and 7 in some
other city.  That it caused the bullet train to stop, and caused some
fires elsewhere.</p>

<p>One man in the voice room predicted a big earthquake within two
weeks.</p>

<p>I was all, "alright!" but not everyone shared my enthusiasm.  I
just know that I'll be okay; if a big earthquake is an experience I
get to have, then I'm ready.</p>

<p>On the train now to go home and life is normal.  Train is full.
People are talking or reading as they always do on the way home.</p>
