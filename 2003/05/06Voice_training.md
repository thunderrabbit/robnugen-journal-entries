<p>Voice Training II was like a whirlwind of information being blown
at us all at once.  It could have been extended to a two day
conference, but apparently Nova believes it wouldn't benefit from such
an arrangement.  So we go four hours and now I zip off to work four
shifts.</p>

<p>I was smart enough to jump on the Limited Express train.  This
train stops only once between Yokohama and ÇﬁÇ≥ÇµÅ[Ç±Ç∑Ç¨.  That stop
does not include my station in Ç¬Ç»ÇµÇ‹.  I get to be all
sheeeeeewwww right past my station.  hahahahah, non limited-express
suckas!</p>

<p>A really funny thing about that story is that there's a direct line from Yokohama to Kawasaki.  I took the line past my station, switched to a different line, went to Kawasaki.
