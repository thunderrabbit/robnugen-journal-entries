<p>The bullet trains are *so* fast.  Shit they're just amazingly fast
and when I ride to work along the river, I go underneath a bullet
train track.</p>

<p>Tonight, as I approached the tracks...  it's just like
whhhoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooommmmm and then it's
gone.  Always 16 white cars with a pointy snout and pointy tail.
Maybe I'll take an mpeg of it with my camera sometime.  It's just sooo
fucking <em>fast!</em></p>

<p>The vantage point I have from the river doesn't put me right beside
the tracks, but about five feet below the actual track level..  BUT
there's a wall that nearly blocks the whole thing from my view when
I'm close to the tracks.  I look forward to having a clear close view
of those trains screaming by like aircraft.</p>

<p>That's how fast it seems.  It might as well fly.</p>

<br>Hi Rob,<br>
<br>
I was working on a letter to Judy Bayley and starting thinking about you.I went to your website (for the first
    time) and read the last 3 days--you've gone through a lot! I hope in the future you have a month of happiness for
    each day of frustration.<br>
<br>
Everyone is different, of course, but your journal helps me guess what my wife must have gone through her first
    couple of months in the U.S.<br>
<br>
Hope you have many breakthroughs in learning Japanese!<br>
<br>
Your friend,<br>
Steve
