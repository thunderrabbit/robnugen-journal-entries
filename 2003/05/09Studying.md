<p class=date>11:28am JST Friday 9 May 2003</p>

<p>Just studied verbs with Ayana.  Now I can say I'm going to Nova at
11:30 today.  kyounojyouichihamNovaOikimas.</p>

<p>One silly thing about Japanese is they don't split things up into
words.  It's just yammeryammeryammerallstrungtogetherlikethis.  At
least there are sentence breaks.</p>

<p>And I can say I went to sleep at 1am last night.
Kinohiyoichijininemashta. And other things that are not 100% clear in
my head.</p>
