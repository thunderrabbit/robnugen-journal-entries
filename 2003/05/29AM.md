<p>Yay for janette calling me this morning!  I had just gotten over
the edge between sleepin' and wakin'.  I was lolling about not wanting
to get up and begin my work week, but talking to her tends to be
inspiring.</p>

<p>I need to confirm that I can get off work 4 through 20 September.
I'll ask Steve today.  We're supposed to have been here six months
before we can vacate; that will be my sixth month....  It'll all be
good.</p>
