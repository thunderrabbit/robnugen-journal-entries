<p>Man, stupid Mac iPhoto is dumb.  I'm only using it cause it's fast,
but it's wack the way it put together this photo album for Hakone.
It's like as good as a beta version of the software, with inconsistent
links and crap like that.</p>

<p>Anyway, if I remember, there will be images of hakone on my site by
the time this entry is up.  Click on japan above and look for hakone
pics.</p>

<br>Hi Rob,<br>
<br>
Maybe the fish jumping out of the water was on the forest fire prevention sign because when fires occur, erosion increases. Sediment load into water bodies increases and blocks out sunlight which some aquatic organisms like algae rely on for survival. Basically, fish die when the food chain gets screwed up. - Last Sunday in San Diego I saw an Imax about coral reefs and this happened off the coast of fiji or someplace. The coral reefs and fish that relied on the reefs went away or died because of increased sediment load due to forest fires.<br>
<br>
What do you think of this theory?<br>
