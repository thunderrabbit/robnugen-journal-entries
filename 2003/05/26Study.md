<p>Stop fuckin' around and study.</p>

<p>Wait.</p>

<p>I got a box of COOKIES from janette and CDs from g!!  The CDs are
of Futurama episodes and I'm sure I'll love them.  For some reason,
though, my CD/DVD player ate the CD and won't give it back.  I'm quite
certain it's not the fault of the CD, but that the CD player is
damaged since I banged my computer pretty effectively one day and the
CD player started grinding and farting and stuff.  Now it won't play
the CD.  Ah well.  I wonder if I can fix it or if I should take it to
some Mac place in Japan.</p>

<p>The cookies are chocolate chip and chocolate chocolate chip and
they're the best cookies <em>ever</em>!!</p>

<br>thank you for the compliment.  i love that you love my cookies.<br>
  i watched sesame street this morning with my 14 month old nephew.  when i saw cookie monster, i thought of you. <br>
  no, not because you're blue.<br>
<br>
 that's too bad about your cd player.  i hope you can get it fixed easily.<br>
"since I banged my computer pretty effectively one day and the CD player started grinding and farting and stuff"- you are so funny, cookie monster.
