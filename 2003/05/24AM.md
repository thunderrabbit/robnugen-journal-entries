<p class=date>8:54am JST Saturday 24 May 2003</p>

<p>This morning was surprising to me; I expected to be totally
dragging, but I totally woke up early-ish, with the sense of having
had one hugemongous dream all night including problems with my
bicycle, and people at work with me climbing on and cleaning a statue
type thing or some old metal pipes, and climbing on some sand piles,
with the sense that we might not oughta be doing that cause our
climbing disrupted the natural nature of things there.</p>

<p>I woke up to find my light on and flashcards slightly crinkled to
the side of my bed.</p>

<p>I'm leaving for work a bit later than I have on past Saturdays, but
I still will have plenty-ish of time to get ready.</p>

<p>Did not charge my computer last night so my battery is at 18%.</p>
