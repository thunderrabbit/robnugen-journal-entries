<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>I missed OKC Rally.  OKC is my favorite rally besides Houston.
And Houston is my favorite only because Jason and I planned it for
some years in a row and made it kick major ass.</p>

<p>OKC is my favorite rally because of fantastic memories of OKC 1987
and the church is a coooool shape for Sardines and awesome Silent
Football memories and because I learned the secret to Ceiling Wall
Floor at OKC.</p>

<p>I hope you cats had major fun.</p>

<p>You're still in my dreams at night.</p>

<p>I'm not going to attend SWUUSI.  I'm not even going to try, though
last year I said I would ask for the time off.  I don't want to go
through the pain of saying Goodbye again....  This seems to be what
Bryn described to me at San Antonio Rally a couple years ago.  I
wonder if it's subconsciously a reason I'm not getting too close to
people here in Japan.</p>

<p>Shit I gotta go to bed.  I have Japanese class in 9.5 hours.</p>
