<p class=date>10:24pm JST Thursday 29 May 2003</p>

<p>Boo for strict Japanese culture!  I cannot easily get time off
until 28 September, which will be the first day of my second six
months here.  Starting then it will be "no problem" to get time off.
I'll talk to janette tonight about how that affects plans and such.  I
called Josephine around 1pm my time = 11pm last night her time.
janette was snoozin' and I didn't want to wake her up with 'bad' news.
Plus I only had 2 minutes left on the phone card.</p>

<p>Some people here spend all their money on alcohol.  I spend mine on
chocolate, internet, and long distance calls.</p>
