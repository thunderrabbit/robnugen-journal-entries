<p>Today I had FUT 2 (Follow Up Training 2) at Yokohama.  It wasn't as
bad as FUT 1 in terms of filling my brain to overflowing, but it was
certainly not my favorite thing in the world.</p>

<p>BUT, it means I can give level ups to students (recommend they move
from a level to the next level).  It takes two teachers to suggest a
student level up, plus the student passing a test (tailored for that
level) to move them to the next level.</p>

<p>Today as I went through my files, I saw that Rachel had given a LU
1 recommendation to a student and I ignored it, thinking I would not
let that sway my decision.</p>

<p>Later, when I had the class, I was like, "wow she was good" and it
turned out to be the student Rachel had recommended as well.  SO, I
got to give her the second LU!  But the student had split before I
completed her file in the teachers' room, so I didn't actually get to
give it to her.  Plus the original recommendation was a month and 2
days old (limit is supposed to be one month), but she hadn't been here
in a month and 2 days, so Steve was all, "can she move to the next
level?"  "yes" "then level her up."</p>

<p>That made today's training worth it.</p>

<p>Such a good feeling that I almost think I'll begin to memorize the
criteria for leveling up students to different levels.  Maybe I'll
start with the low levels and learn the criteria one level at a
time.</p>

<p>That makes sense.</p>
