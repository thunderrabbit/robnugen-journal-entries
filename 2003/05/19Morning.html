<p>Called Jackie this morning to confirm she got the NIN I sent her.
She had.  Rock.</p>

<p>Been half-lumpy half-studying this morning.  Flashcards rule.  They
help me bypass the word circus in my head my visual-vocal ability
seems more efficient than visual-language1-language2-vocal.</p>

<p>I now know 
<br>cat = ねこ
<br>snake = へび
<br>mountain = やま
<br>はさみ = scissors
<br>ほん = book
<br>もも = peach
<br>dog = いぬ
<br>かさ = umbrella
<br>ゆき = snow
<br>うま = horse
<br>ant = あり
</p>

<p>To obtain the list above, I went through the flashcards and first
wrote the first word that appeared, and then its translation.  Nice.</p>

<p>I'm running off to the internet cafe in a bit after I shower and
such.</p>
