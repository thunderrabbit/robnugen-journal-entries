<p>It's raining today.  Just drizzling actually.  (Which is more rain,
drizzle or sprinkle? (I think sprinklng is larger drops))</p>

<p>I don't have my jacket; I left it at the lounge on Wednesday and
it's not been convenient to get it (due to work, and I've chosen not
to take a chance of going over there since they are probably closed
before 7am and after 9pm)</p>

<p>So I'm not taking my backpack (computer) to work.  I almost never
need it, and the only reason I can think I'd be like "dammit; I wish I
had it" is if there's a big earthquake today.</p>

<p class=date>7:16pm</p>

<p>No earthquake today, but the storm coming in is almost as cool.</p>

<p>Cool in a different way - cool like this is a part of nature of
which I've seen plenty.  And I've seen storms far cooler than this
one, but this is the coolest I've seen in Japan.  Wind is blowing
pretty effectively and the river is way high compared to normal.  It's
above all the markers I've used in the past to gauge its depth.  so
I've used a new system.  There are 10 levels of blocks visible along
the side of the river.</p>

<p>I've got no idea how many blocks are usually visible, but I can see
the river is far wider than normal.  My sense is that not many more
levels of blocks exist, but that there's the equivalent of a flood
plain below the lowest level of bricks.</p>

<br>my personal opinion is that a drizzle is heavier than a sprinkle. a sprinkle of rain is when it's that misty annoying crap that when you try to wipe it off your windshield just smudges everywhere and makes things blurrier. also, dude yesterday there was a real tornado in houston (sugarland area)!!! crazy crazy shit. and it's been storming here a lot. flooding and cars being stuck places. a good time for imaginations to kick in to gear and pretend that an evil warlord is attacking our primitive village and the tree soldiers who bend and sway in the wind and rain are protecting our little houses.<br>
much love always,<br>
