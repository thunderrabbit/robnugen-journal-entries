<p>Today I'll be working at what we call KQ.  It's the satellite
school of Kawasaki Nova.  I'm not sure what Q stands for, but I'm
pretty sure the K is for Kawasaki.</p>

<p>The school is not yet open; I'm going to study while I eat.</p>

<p>Man, KQ stands for eazy breazy; this was a relaxing day.  Plus I
had the most hilarious lesson *ever*!!  These three women were 7Cs but
they were so outrageously hilarious!  I told the the game called
"Sausages" and...God I don't even remember; they were just
hilarious.</p>

<p>To kick off the lesson, one of them took my picture with a little
Polaroid camera which she uses to remember her instructors....</p>

<p>What a lesson.  What a day.  Nice nice nice.</p>
