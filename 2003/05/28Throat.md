<p>My throat is a tidbit sore.  I felt it starting after I ate curry
rice with Kimberly and Landen.  The rice was kinda spicy; I didn't
know if maybe that had caused it.  Due to my innate ability to not get
sick, I don't know what to do if I do get sick, including now.  I've
slept most of today after studying with Koko, and I've been drinking
lots of water.  Maybe a hot cup of tea will do well for me.  I've
chowed some of the food I bought yesterday evening with Matty.</p>

<p>Part of me wants to just lose myself online, part of me just wants
to eat, part of me just wants to sleep.  I think it's good to not have
internet access in the apartment, or I wouldn't study as much
Japanese.</p>
