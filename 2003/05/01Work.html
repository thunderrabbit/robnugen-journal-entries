<p>Work was aight today.  Had some man to mans (usually good) and some
level 7Cs (lowest level (often bad)) and one level 3 class (pretty
great English skills (almost always good unless they are better at
grammar than I)) and one level 4 class (good skillz (good))</p>

<p>Whatever.</p>

<p>I rode my bike to work for the first time in a real life situation
and I felt pretty confident I was going the right way at each
intersection; it basically takes two turns to get there, but many
vaguely similar intersections and landmarks, so it's still a bit
tricky.  What I mostly end up doing is watching for big road signs
that point me toward different cities.  I intentionally rode mostly
slowly so I wouldn't be coated in sweat when I arrived.  I was a tad
sweaty in the pits and on my back (from my back pack), but otherwise
no worries.  Oh and my footses were quite hot.  I might wear
sandals??????? to ride and then put on shoes at work so I won't
impregnate these leather shoes with sweat.</p>

<p>Rode home and similarly didn't get lost.  But the coooooolest
thing was the bullet train.</p>
