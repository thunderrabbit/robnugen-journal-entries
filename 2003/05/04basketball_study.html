<p>Frank is watching recently recorded basketball games recorded and
sent by his mom.  He knows the outcome of all the games, but hasn't
seen the actual games.</p>

<p>I've been mostly studying, or maybe mostly watching, but pretty
close to half and half overall.  I've got the concept of particles in
my head.  Like は and を and に and one more that I've forgotten.
There are many of these, which basically specify how nouns are being used in sentences.</p>

<p>I can say shit like ぼくは　じょういじに　NOVAを　いきます, which I think
means "I will go to Nova at 10" and breaks down as I (subject) 10 (at)
Nova (object) go.</p>

<p>This is almost certainly not exactly right, but I certainly hope
it's at least close enough that a native speaker could figure out what
I'm trying to say.</p>
