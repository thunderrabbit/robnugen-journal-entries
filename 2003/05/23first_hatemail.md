<p>Finally.  I've received something like hatemail.  It's not really
that, but I gotta start somewhere.</p>

I know you think your cool but you come across as an arrogant
jackass.  Settle down a bit and maybe you will make some friends in
Japan.

<br>wow, what a freehole (ha)<br>
i like that he (i'm thinking that a female would not use those words) wrote "your" instead of "you're". (that's just me being an arrogant jackass)<br>
i wonder who it is.  i bet it's someone who doesn't know you at all.  settle down?  what the hell does that mean? don't be excited? play nintendo?  what?

<br>thats really ridiculous. maybe instead of trying to hurt others this person should work on perfecting himself. and his grammar. "your not that cool"<br>
try "YOU'RE not that cool." hahahahahahaha<br>
<br>
<br>
