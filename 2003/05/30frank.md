<p>Yammered with Frank for over an hour tonight.  Some about Nova (I
gave my phone number to a student, hoping to help her get out of Level
5, where she's been stuck for 3 years(!)), and alcohol problems that
many instructors seem to have (why? maybe cause they are attracted to
Nova and because Japan/Nova encourages drinking?), and about
god/religion.. and about travel in Japan.  Hakone is Frank's favorite
place in Japan now too.</p>
