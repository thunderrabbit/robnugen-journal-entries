<p>I have decided to restructure my thoughts about losing things.
Yesterday I lost my pack of flashcards that I've been studying.  On it
I had translated to Japanese, "may I park here?" and took it to the
bike parking lot.  That parking lot is the last place I flat remember
having it.  I went back there and attempted to ask, translating "lost"
and "similar" because I had another set of (blank) flashcards, but the
attempt did not result in flashcard recovery.</p>

<p>I turned off the tape machine in my head that was like, "nyah nyah
you can't keep anything" and turned it to a golden message that I am
done with the item; I don't need it anymore.  Release.  Release.</p>

<p>I realize I'm no monk; I would do a double-triple-quadruple
flip-out if I lost my computer anytime soon.  But I can release a pack
of flashcards.</p>

<p>I'm at Starbucks for my lesson with Å†Å‚Ç» at 9:30 (Å≠Ç∂ÅÕÇÒ).  I'll
read Japanese until then.</p>
