<p>Took a big ol' fat nap with my short hair and then studied katakana
for an hour.  I now know ア - ノ.</p>

<p>They didn't cut my hair with no guard, so I'm going to go shave the
shit off in the shower now.   Not going to fucking waste 950
yen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and not have short-ass hair.  Damn that
was expensive.</p>
