<p>Oh my god.  As I was blabbering on so eloquently about why I love
to blabber fully blabberfully on my site, I forgot about meeting Ayana
for tutoring today.  She graciously let me cancel this meeting for no
charge, and graciously said that I'd have to pay next time I cancel
with no warning.  I'm supposed to be in Shibuya in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Ponder ponder ponder...  An idea is to go there now and carefully
measure how long it takes me to get there.  Cointoss
says....... no.</p>

<p>I absolutely will get a whiteboard to use as a calendar; that's the
technique that's organically developed ...  shit that is *ridiculous*
that I carry this computer around and don't use it as a calendar!  And
it's a Mac for god's sakes that should be easy to do!!!!</p>

<p>The hardest part is training myself to write in here.</p>

<p>Ironies abound that I'm compelled to write all the events that
occur, but not write all that I have planned.  'swat it boils down
to.  Okay fine.  Move on.</p>

<p>I'm going to the 100 yen store to get a whiteboard.</p>
