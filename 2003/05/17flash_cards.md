<p>I bought flashcards on the way home from work today.  Actually it
was right near my work so I went back to show the girls who staff our
office.  They were appropriately appreciative.  Their encouragement
helps me study; I can flirt with them by speaking snippets of
Japanese.  Very harmless snippets like "horse" and "I am eating
rice."</p>
