<p>Great day at work today.</p>

<p>Great 1: working at KQ.  (turns out that is short for Keiku,
pronounced "KQ")</p>

<p>Great 2: talking to a guy who was all, "I want to live in Italy."
I was all, "dude; if you want to live in Italy, then live in Italy,"
etc etc and gave him even the first steps: 1) google.com: Teach
Japanese Italy   2) write to the addresses that come up.   OR 1)
google.com: Japanese Consul Italy  2) write to the addresses that come
up.</p>

<p>Easy, of course.  But I could tell this cat was like, "oh shit" in
his mind cause he was scared.  I was all, "I was scared before I came
to Japan." and to test his English I was all, "what did I type in
google.com?"  yes Teach English Japan.</p>

<p>Such a great blast to kindle someone's dreams!</p>
