<p>After class I got ..  oh  *during* class (during break) I was
tapped on the shoulder by ‚±‚±'s mom and I didn't recognize her at
first.  She was all "yammeryammer" and I'm all, "um, hi!" knowing that
a Japanese wouldn't approach me unless s/he was sure of my identity.
I realized it was Koko's mom (have only seen her a couple times in
this sea of Japanese faces) and she said something about the bike.
I'm all, "oh yeah, it's great!" or some shit, not telling her that it
has a flat.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the conversation didn't get to that point, but it did
get to the point where she told me that Koko is at home sleeping, not
feeling all that hot today.</p>

<p>After class, I stopped by a bike shop and the cat fixed the flat
(two punctures in the tube, both by a single small piece of wire that
he found still in the tire) pretty quickly.  They have different
styles of bike maintenence here.  Well, at least he did.  Using pliers
instead of a correctly-sized wrench to get off the nut from the valve
stem (and scarring the threads on the valve stem (<em>threads</em> on
a valve stem!) and then *cut* off the nut to keep from having to
unscrew it all the way), and never actually taking the wheel off the
bike.  That saved a significant amount of time, I imagine, since he
didn't have to reseat the wheel nor fix the train nor any of that.</p>

<p>1470 yen.  Fair enough.  Just glad to have it fixed.</p>
