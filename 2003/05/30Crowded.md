<p>Okay. <em>that</em> train was rather crowded.</p>

<p>I just took an 8:30am-ish express from Moto-Sumiyoshi to
Shibuya.</p>

<p>People just push themselves onto the train butt first, using the
top of the door frame for leverage.  People behind them just shuffle
silently backwards, apparently unaware that anything is happening.  No
one complains; no one sighs; no one seems to notice.</p>
