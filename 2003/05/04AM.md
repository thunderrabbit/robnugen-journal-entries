<p>Yesterday Mike was in a room next to me and he said something like,
"I would like to wake up <em>naturally</em>, but I have to use an
alarm," to explain the word naturally.  He went on to say that he
would be able to do that when he was 70, when he is retired.</p>

<p>Dude.  I wake up without an alarm most days.  I like that about
myself.  I just go to bed at a time called <em>earlier</em>.</p>
