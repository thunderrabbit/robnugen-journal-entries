<p class=date>11:27pm JST Monday 19 May 2003</p>

<p>At Fred's suggestion, I added a redirect from journal.pl to
journal.pl?date=yyyy/mm/dd.  So for example, today
www.robnugen.com/journal redirects twice, all the way to
www.robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?date=2003/05/19.</p>

<p>Lemme know if probs.</p>
