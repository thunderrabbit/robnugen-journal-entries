<p class=dream>Watching a large ship in the water moving from Japan to
an island. I was floating out in the water at the time and the ship
accelerated for a while and then decelerated the same amount for the
second half of its journey.  I swam over to its path and found the
water was quite shallow, like only a couple of feet deep and I didn't
understand how such a large boat could have been floating in such
shallow water.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I was floating in the wake of a large man walking
the same path as the boat had taken.  He was a pretty funny guy,
making jokes or something along the way.  Jokes and sound effects.</p>
