<p>Kids' training was.. interesting today.  Basically we were 1/2 told
about training and 1/2 "trained" as if we were kids.  At some points I
could see the entertainment and the value and at other points I was
like "this is the stupidest thing in the planet."</p>

<p>Matty said he knows of someone who quit Nova because of Kids'
Training.  I'm not going to quit, but I'm certainly not really
interested in teaching kids.  Little 3-12 year olds...  Yeeesh not for
me.</p>

<p>Met a cute girl from <em>Tasmania</em>, which made her seem all the
more interesting. Tasmania!!  Thonly thing I know about Tasmania is
that Warner Brothers has named a devil after it.</p>

<p>I was like, "eeee too cold" which I assumed was the case cause it
seems to be as far south as the northern US is north, but she was like
Nah it ain't that cold.   Maybe that's cause she's from there.</p>

<p>Anyway, we did not exchange information so I'll likely never see
her again.</p>

<p>She got fired though when I asked her what movie she doesn't like
and she said...... "Pulp Fiction."  (What a strange question, eh? but
it was part of our training today).  And she doesn't like hip hop
*and* she does like jazz.  phff. whatever.</p>
