<p>Frank is getting demolished in basketball.  Oh it's Playstation,
not Sega.  81 to 58 with 4 minutes to go.</p>

<p>I think a shot from behind the half court line should be worth 4
points if it goes in.  And 5 points if it's thrown from the opposite
court's painted area below the basket.</p>

<p>Final score 97 to 76.  Brutal.</p>

<p>(as Frank would say)</p>
