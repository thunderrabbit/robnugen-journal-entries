<p>A possible student sent me their phone number, but when I called
it, the call wouldn't go through.  According to the employee here at
the cafe, it's either a wrong number or maybe the person has used the
equivalent of a spam blocker on the phone.</p>

<p>Gotta give me the correct number or turn off spam block before I
can call you, jack.</p>
