<p class=date>2:30pm JST Wednesday 7 May 2003</p>

<p>Good thing is that I made it back to my train line without getting
lost.  That's four blocks, two new lines and three new stations that
I've navigated and remembered for an hour.</p>

<p>Hurry up, fucking train.  I've written all of the above and this
and the train hasn't moved yet.  And I got out my computer after I got
on the train.</p>

<p>About to go .... now.</p>

<p>I also need to eat; I've not yet eaten today.</p>

<p class=date>3:29pm</p>

<p>Now I'm home.  Now I've eaten.  Now I've ironed a shirt.  If by
ironed I mean I've ironed most of the parts of a shirt that can be
easily ironed and easily seen when I'm wearing it.</p>
