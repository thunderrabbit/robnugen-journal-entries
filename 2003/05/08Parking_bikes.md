<p>Persist persist persist and ignore the frustration.  I was able to
communicate with the guys at the bike parking place and I don't
understand all things bike-parking, but I've got some basics.</p>

<p>100 yen per day for a bike.</p>

<p>2000 yen per month for a bike.</p>

<p>6000 yen per three months for a bike.</p>

<p>I joked with them on this last price.  Why would anyone pay 6000
ahead of time when it's not a better price?</p>

<p>One weird thing on the month tickets; it seems they are only
available on the 25th and 26th of the preceding month.  But they are
good until the end of the next month, so it's like getting 4 days
free, but really it isn't cause I just have to pay 4 days ahead of
time next time.  It's only like getting 4 days free each time I skip
and don't park my bike for the first 25 days of a month.</p>
