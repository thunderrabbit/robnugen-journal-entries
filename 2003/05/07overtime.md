<p>Overtime was nice.  Easy.  Full of thanks from the staff for my
help.  The school is soooo cute cause they've got only 3 digit numbers
for the students, and some students have only got 2 digits!!!  I had
three classes and 1 voice lesson.  All pretty easy.  For one lesson I
actually had a plan of sorts, but they kept just asking me questions
so I was content to answer them.  I tried twice to stay on a track.  I
wonder if they were intentionally flirting; one of them asked, "where
is your regular school?" and I heard "can I see you again
somewhere?"</p>

<p>Not likely, but maybe.</p>

<p>Andrea, Callum, and Janet were the other instructors.</p>
