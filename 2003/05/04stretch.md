<p>I'm just now getting to bed (I took a phat nap after work) and I
had a flash thought.  Back in Dallas in my last couple days there I
went to the store (Target / Ross) by myself to get clothes.  That felt
like a real stretch like ooh I'm going shopping without a girlfriend
to show me what to do.</p>

<p>Compared to the shit I've been doing here...... that was
<em>nothing</em>.  Hooray for personal growth.</p>
