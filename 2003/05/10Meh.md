<p class=date>9:09pm JST Saturday 10 May 2003</p>

<p>Today was pretty busy at work, but I didn't freak and need a hug
nor assistance like I did the last time (and Carla helped me).</p>

<p>I got off work around 6pm and decided to check my email to see if
anyone is looking for an English teacher just like me.</p>

<p>I then decided I was too tired, so I headed.... not toward home,
but toward the grocery store and bought some stuff, including what I
hoped was soy milk, but turned out to be rice milk.  And including
what I hoped were blueberry cookies but turned out to be black bean
crackers.</p>

<p>Came home, discovered my misconceptions, ate some anyway.  Ate
chocolate until my tum was like, "okay, enough chocolate" and a little
pile of wrappers collected on the bed.</p>

<p>Decided to nap right after I finish reading livejournal entries and
I just finished that.  My resulting mood is like....  glad that I'm
"up to date" on people's lives, and wondering if my own life is going
along in an optimal configuration.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Pretty much it is; I mean shit; I'm living in Japan and pretty much
have gotten stabilized despite some setbacks that some might consider
pretty major</p>

<p>Oh!  It's time for a State of My Life Address.</p>
