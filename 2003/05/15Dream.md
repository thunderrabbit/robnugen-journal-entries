<p class=dream>I was living back in Tomball except the terrain
included a huge gulley with large piles of dirt like 60+ feet tall to
shape the flow of water.  Some kids were racing motorcycles on it,
destroying the contours and creating a general nuisance of themselves.</p>

<p class=dream>I asked how I could report them and there was to be a
town meeting in a few days run via Robert's Rules and I immediately
wondered if I could remember all the rules so that I could bring up
the complaint.</p>

<p class=dream>Doing laundry and Eminem was there as well preparing
for his show that was to be that night.  We started talking and he was
friendly and I wasn't nervous, but was just me and we laughed it up
about randomness.  Then I was like, "let me buy a ticket from you" but
he was all, "naw I got my friendlies" or something and was going to
give me a ticket.  He was looking through his bag for one and kept
finding old tickets to old shows.  I woke up before he gave me
one.</p>
