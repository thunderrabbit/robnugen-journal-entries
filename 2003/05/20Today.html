<p>Today has been awesome.</p>

<p>Notable:</p>

<p>(~) I worked overtime at KQ.</p>

<p>(!) I had a total of 9 students today.</p>

<p>(@) I had a total of 3 (out of 8) lessons free (0 students)</p>

<p>(#) Something shook the whole building, but it wasn't an
earthquake; it was the construction next door digging a hole or
something.  Really weird.</p>

<p>($) I got candy, a compass, a book and a card from TinaP!</p>

<p>(%) I talked to janette who gave me all the latest news and gossip</p>

<p>(^) She also told me that someone has requested my info on
findateacher.net!  (I'll check tomorrow to see if they wrote to me)</p>

<p>(&) It rained mostly all day today.</p>

<p>(*) Good night.</p>
