<p>Sometimes I run scenarios through my head, imagined conflicts that
I think might happen and get my brain fully "prepared" to engage -
practicing what I'll say if s/he says this, or if he says that...  how
I can defend myself and prove that I've done the right thing.</p>

<p>I just recently got a phone call from work saying that Tsurumi
school thinks I'm scheduled to work <em>there</em> today in the early
shift.  The woman who called is from Kawasaki (I think) and couldn't
find a shift swap form.  I know one reason she can't find it is that
it doesn't exist.  Or that I never saw it.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was going through scenarios of them falsifying the
document to fake like I had signed it and I prepared myself to
basically quit my job.  And then I'm arguing with a mental version of
Steve about riding my bike to work.</p>

<p>On a non-bizarre note, I've just done laundry.  Actually, some
might think that <em>is</em> bizarre for me.</p>

<p>Okay I'm going to hang up this laundry, and roll to work.</p>
