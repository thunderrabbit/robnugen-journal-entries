<p class=date>9:38pm HST Saturday 8 February 2003</p>

<p>Traded smiles with a cutie who apparently has a boyfriend so I
didn't talk to her.  When I saw her later getting on the bus she and
he seem to have plenty of baggage.  As we were waiting at the carousel
for Janette and Reenie's relatively small bags, tons of huge bags were
pouring onto the conveyor and I'm just thinking "fuckin' americans..."
with all their belongings and stuff stuff stuff.</p>

<p>The cutie and her boyfriend are on the bus one seat up from us
across the aisle.  fuckin' stalker.</p>

<p>Oh, on the way out of the airport we saw a box labeled AMNESTY BOX,
and Janette was all, "that's the last chance to drop off your monkey."</p>

<p>Hahah  'Okay, Bobo, you stay here while I go run around the island!'</p>
