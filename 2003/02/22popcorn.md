<p>Yesterday Janette made popcorn and I was all, "remember that scene
is <em>Grosse Point Blank</em> at the very end where the guy ran out
of bullets and is going to buy some and the other guy is like okay for
ten thousand dollars and he's all okay and then the good guy throws a
TV on the head of the badguy just as he says 'Popcorn!'"</p>

<p>And Josephine is all "yeah.  Oh, Grosse Point Blank is playing
tonight and tomorrow night at midnight."</p>

<p>So we're going.</p>

<p class=date>12:11am</p>

<p>Met two peeps whose names I didn't get because the cat up front was
giving away door prizes.</p>

<p>David and  Dana are behind us.  HI!!</p>

<p>Dana noticed that emacs has two "TOOLS" menus on the top bar and I
noticed that the second Tools menu has two Services items on it.</p>

<p>"What are those crazy Mac people thinking?" wonders Dana.</p>

<p>Cyndi Lauper onscreen before the movie: "HI, this is my new
video."</p>

<p>"If by 'new' you mean...."</p>

<p>Oh my lord we are laughing our asses off at this vdeo of True
Colors by Cyndi Lauper.  Holy shit this is hilarious!!</p>

<p>What are those crazy 80s people thinking?</p>

<p>"Wike a waaainn--bow..."</p>
