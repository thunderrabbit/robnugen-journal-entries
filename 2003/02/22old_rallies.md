<p>I've been digging back through my old 1997 entries, converting them
from static index format to a format that can be used with my
journal.pl script.  In the process, I have moved the 1997 rally
reviews from the SWD YRUU site on geocities to here.  The SWD YRUU
site seems to be finished; it lasted a few years and now seems that no
one is updating it.  So I want to get the reviews off it before they
vanish if the username is swallowed up by yahoo.  And before I roll
out to Japan I'd like to get my site stabilized, whatever the hell
that means.</p>
