<p>Slid over to the park where a guy with a mini snowboard (plastic
skateboard with no trucks) was being pulled by someone with a rope.</p>

<p>Josephine's friend Jeremy also had a snowskateboard; we slid down a
small hill with it some times for pretty good entertainment.  Janette
went back and got a cookie pan (the round one I gave to her), which
was sturdy enough almost, but not quite the best suited for sliding on
snow since it has holes in it.</p>

<p>The trickiest trick I did at the park was sliding down the spiral
slide and shooting out the bottom onto my butt.  Oh, and the coolest
trick I did was jump out of a swing and slide across the ice.  The
coolest thing I did not try was sliding off the roof of the pool house
onto the ice.  I chose not to pursue anything higher than jumping off
the public phone, since I slipped backwards when I landed.</p>
