<p class=date>5:28pm CST Sunday 2 February 2003</p>

<p>Fred and I left before dinner started; didn't get to see Katie
again who had left to get her boyfriend.</p>

<p>Fred turned left on Gosling and drove a long ass way before
deciding that there was no convenient connection to Woodlands Parkway,
but not before we saw three kids beating up another kid.</p>

<p>On the way back we stopped, but he said he was okay.  Fred said he
had just finished crying and neither of us saw any bruises or cuts.  I
hope they can figure this out without killing anyone.</p>

<p>Now Fred and I are at Northwoods to chill.</p>

<p class=date>6:38pm</p>

<p>We went through Tamarac park to the school playground where we
played a bit of follow the leader and then I climbed up a 15 foot pole
except it was two poles about 18 inches apart.  They were wearing a
small curved hat to keep kids from climbing any higher; they'd hit
their head on the hat.</p>

<p>I climbed on top of the hat.</p>

<p>I was about to get down when I realized I should stand on the hat.
My only opportunity to stand on a hat on top of two poles.  Gotta do
it now.</p>

<p>Talked to Fred and listened to his latest electronic adventures in
breaking up with Kat.  They are like in the final chapter it seems.
Probably shouldn't write that publically, but it's not anything he
wouldn't tell anyone except Kat and her best friend so don't tell
them.   Anyway, the point is that Fred and I haven't really talked
about girl issues before.  We're just getting into that and I'm
thankful for the closer connection.</p>
