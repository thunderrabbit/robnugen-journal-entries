<p>Chillin' at Amy's now after chuch.  The service featured the Men's
Gorilla Orchestra and Chorus, started by Mark Holt back in the day.  I
messed myself up by predicting Katie would sit by me but when Meagan
Holt sat by me she was all, "do you remember me?"  Ummmm and it didn't
*look* like Katie; wrong color hair and all that, but my brain was
locked on that name and I tried to see Katie in Meagan, but it wasn't
working.  Then she told me.  D'oh!  of course.</p>

<p>Great to see people and soul-connect with Char "to be continued"
Crofut.</p>

<p>Saw other cool cats: Hallie, Bob Finney, Larry, Bob Ellis, Mary and
Terry, Mary and Jon, and all the others whose name I've forgotten.
Oh, and Tina, and Johnny.  And the rest.  here on gilligan's
island.</p>

<p>Still chillin' at Amy-Katie-Mary-Terry's house (in reverse age
order).  Freddo is here too.  Mary and Terry just got back from Hawaii
this morning I believe.  She's wearing fake plumeria and a lei and
hibiscus.  They stayed on Maui I think.</p>

<p>Been talking a bit to Amy's granddad who's from Indiana.</p>

<p>Terry and Amy's grandma are cooking in the kitchen.</p>
