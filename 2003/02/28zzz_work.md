<p>So Austin Rally is kicking it and I'm still awake.</p>

<p>But I'm not at the rally; I was at work until now.  Bluh.  Well at
least that will help me bling bling it some.  I should make like $150
from today.</p>

<p>Clocked in at 10:47 AM and out at 3:36 AM or so.</p>

<p>Laura Douglas, her friend Paul, Meredith Kime (Matt's sister) are
on Janette's bed watching a movie.  Joel Rowboat is watching a concert
movie on the computer.  Jack and Heather are on Sean's bed sleeping.</p>

<p>Josephine is at the rally.</p>

<p>I'm supposed to be back at work at 10am.  Fuck.</p>

<p>It's for a big fucking Bosier City church stage decoration (railing
thing and podiums, all of which are heavy as fuck)</p>

<p>I'm falling asleep as I write.</p>

<p>My foot is fine; I didn't cover it today.  In fact when we set up
the stage at Fair Park out in the mud, my socks and shoes got all
muddy, and when I couldn't stand the soaked feeling on my wrinkly
feet, I took my shoes and socks off.  My foot did just fine.  And my
other foot did just as well.</p>

<p>Too tired.</p>

<p>Fun to work with mongu.  He's funny.  We carried parallels off the
truck to under a big white tent for Johnny to build a stage.  Also
carried down 3/4 inch plywood and masonite.  a pile of masonite fell
onto me as I was trying to shift it out of the way and pinned my legs
in the truck.  Took a struggle to get out.  hurt.  Scraped off some
skin from my shins through my jeans.</p>

<p>Went to lunch with Justin and Mongu.  Justin is writing a movie
called Pod Zombies: 15 scenes of people doing pot, turning into
zombies and eating one another.  "When they get the munchies, it's
your ass."</p>
