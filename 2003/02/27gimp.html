<p>Mac GIMP has arrived on CD to the house here.  Let's see if I can
install it with no problems.</p>

<p class=date>12:40am CST Friday 28 February 2003</p>

<p>I ended up installing OS X.2.  Got GIMP installed, but I can't use
it well yet.  Really need a right mouse button to use it easily.  Oh,
and XDarwin doesn't work on 10.2, at least not the version I had, and
according to the notes, won't be supported in future versions of GIMP
er, the other way around.</p>

<p>I can't send mail with my email thing now, and emacs stopped working.
Well, the OS X emacs quit.  The non-window version still works.</p>

<p>Going to bed.</p>

<p>Oh, I now have iChat, which makes all the text be in stupid little
talk bubbles to make it look like icons talking to each other.  I'll
see if the idea becomes likeable to me after a some usage.</p>

<p>I never got back online after I said I would; sorry guys (Calder,
Colleen, Dude)</p>
