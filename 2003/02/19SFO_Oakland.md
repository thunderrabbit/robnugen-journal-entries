<p class=date>6:41am PST Wednesday 19 February 2003</p>

<p>We have made it to San Francisco airport.</p>

<p>The flight was not terribly long nor terribly boring, but the air
was definitely dry on the plane and it took a bit to get my contacts
out.  I slept sideways across three seats with my legs on Janette's
lap, and Janette using my butt as a pillow.</p>

<p>Now chillin' with Reenie a bit until she gets picked up or until we
have to split for our shuttle-BART-shuttle to Oakland airport.</p>

<p>Reminiscing a bit about our trip:</p>

<p>* the cat named Alamo (Al Lemo)
<br>* Alamo going, "shhhh; she's sleeping" at 7:30pm after Janette
laughed on the back porch
<br>* Rita going, "Janette, in Hawaii, we don't sit on tables," when
Janette sat on an outdoor picnic table
<br>* giving a pile of cash to Bernadette the travel agent-ish person
and then showing up at the airport and them saying, "nope, no tickets
here."
<br>* not getting to see lava, but learning about island hopping fares
<br>* chickens and roosters <em>everywhere</em>. (I just did my rooster
impression here in the airport)
<br>* Dolly, the palm branch (yes, it's a leaf, but it's as big as a
branch) shredding dog
<br>* Zach driving us around</p>

<p class=date>10:10am</p>

<p>Janette and I have taken the Bart Bart Bart to Oakland.  I've
plugged in my computer's power thing into the extension cord that's
allocated to power two video terminals of departures and arrivals.
The terminals were off, and the back access door unlocked, so hey,
free electricity.</p>

<p>"Here, you wanna muffin, Muffin?"  Janette has just brought orange
juice and blueberry muffin!  "Here, you want some OJ, Muffin?"</p>

<p>While Janette was eating her apple, I go, "want some muffin,
Muffin?"</p>

<p>"No thanks.... fruit."</p>
