<p>Okay, so the shuttle blew up and that's terrible but what the fuck
is ABC <em>local</em> news thinking by breaking in on the national ABC
news that was actually telling us something interesting, interviewing
<em>knowledgeable</em> NASA employees about the shuttle and all that?
Local ABC broke in on this interview where the cat was giving us new
information to tell us fucking moronic shit like, "oh, the Johnson
Space Center is under tight security now, there's a sense of sadness
here and families are in private rooms" and fucking gossipping about
where people are from in Texas and all this bullshit; just let the
fucking families have their privacy and let them cry and don't splash
their details all over the news..  Shit!</p>

<p class=date>10:36am</p>

<p>According to the news I've been hearing:</p>

<p>Kennedy Space Center is in Houston.
<br>The accident happened around 9:00 am Central time
<br>Challenger explosion was in 1981
</p>

<p>But the worst of all, Jim Hickey of ABC News reading? ranting?  "If
the shuttle program is grounded for <em>months</em> or even
<em><b>years</b></em>, what will become of the 3 astronauts in the
International Space Station?</p>

<p>Who the hell came up with a crisis over that?  What do you think
will "become" of the 3 astronauts?  We'll fucking go back up there
with another Shuttle and pick them up!!!</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry guys; it's just too risky to come back and  get
you.. the shuttle might blow up on re-entry!  You would rather starve,
right?"</p>

<p>Now c'mon Jim, you don't gotta read that.  And if you wrote it,
you're fired!</p>
