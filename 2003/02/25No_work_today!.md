<p>I need the money, but I might as well be happy with a snow day off
from work!  Soon as Janette gets off the phone we'll go for a walk in
the icy outdoors.</p>

<br>Hi, Rob,<br>
<br>
Most of Austin is getting a day off. Jon went to take Alicia to the grocery store and I might go return library books that are due today, but the library may not even be open. The temperature is still below freezing so Jon is worried about frozen pipes when it gets warmer. No one will know a pipe breaks if the water in it is frozen. He checked our outside faucets. I'm sure Dallas got more ice than we did.<br>

How's your cut foot? You found a use for duct tape, anyway!<br>
<br>
Nice that you'll have a going away party. Instead of attending the party, maybe I'll send the gas money I would have spent driving to Dallas.<br>

I talked to Madeleine last night and they have had plenty of snow, including 3 more inches yesterday and more on the way. She and Dick plus two of his brothers and their wives are going to Slovakia soon. They'll all meet in Chicago on the 20th of March and fly out on the 21st and return on April 4. It's a shorter trip than they wanted, but coming back on the 5th would double the air fare!<br>
<br>
The Austin Rally is this weekend, so I'll probably stop in to see what's going on. Did Fred tell you about the young adult group we've started? Several members are former YRUUers--KT Hammons, Katie Lukach, Nathan Ryan, Laura Andress, Laura Ingram, Lauren ? (or is it Lauren Andress...I forget), Ben Atkinson, maybe some others. Kate Robinson came to one meeting but she moved back to Houston. We meet on Wednesdays and will join a Buddhist group for a silent Walking Meditation this Friday.<br>
<br>
Enjoy the ice!<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
<br>
Ma
