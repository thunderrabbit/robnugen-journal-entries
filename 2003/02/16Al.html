<p>Got an astrological reading from Al, which was like Terminator II:
not as amazing as I had expected when I heard about it before
experiencing it.</p>

<p>He did speak rightly about some things, but some other things were
like ehhh maybe.  and easily 1/2 of it was so much like "your jupiter
is in Virgo and tarus is your moon and power and blah blah"
astrological words and crap that meant nothing to me.</p>

<p>But I kept the piece of paper that he drew it all on (my chart and
shit)</p>

<p>He does have some interesting/good things to say.  That natural
laws are not written down but they are those that persevere without
intervention.</p>
