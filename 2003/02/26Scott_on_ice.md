<p>Scott was parked behind Janette's van when she needed to leave.
"Josephine, would you like to drive on ice?"</p>

<p>"Um, no, not really."</p>

<p>"Would you like to move your car out of the way?"</p>

<p>Ah... when in that context, Josephine's need to drive is more
apparent.  I watched as she backed Scott up some, but then got stuck
on the ice in the slant between driveway and street.</p>

<p>Lots of tire spinning, slinging water across the frozen lawn.
After a bit, I came out to help.</p>

<p>Super thanks to my dad for showing me 20 years ago how to get out
of a trough with limited traction.  Back in the day, we had Mr Van at
the beach and he got stuck in soft sand.  Basically my dad drove back
and forth and back and forth, slowly carving a long groove in the
sand, up each side of the trough converting potential energy to
kinetic and back and forth until he got over the hump of the
trough.</p>

<p>So I did the same thing, rocking Scott back and forth with the
clutch and gas, leaving him in the same gear (1st at first, then
reverse when 1st didn't seem to work).  It was fun, and a good little
standard transmission practice for me.</p>
