<p>We're at a big hole near the end of the road.  I've already got big
stories to tell from rock hoppin'.  brb.</p>

<p class=date>4:58pm</p>

<p>We just saw a cave full of water that turns out it's an old school
volcanic tube.  People were kick paddling on boogey board things,
hollering with the echos all reverberating through the whole area.  As
they got past where we could see, and a bit past where they could hear
anyone from shore (since they were yelling so much), someone on shore
suddenly started yelling, "<em>that's not the blue room!!!  That's not
the blue room!!!</em>"</p>

<p>So funny.  Not like oh shit you're going to die that's not the blue
room, but just that's not the blue room.  Not important enough to yell
it through the tunnel.</p>

<p>Turns out the blue room is 1/8th of a mile further away from the
end of the road.  It's called the blue room because for about an hour
during the day in the summer, if one goes way back into the tube, the
room appears blue as the sun shines through all the water.  Zach says
it's pretty much a sacred spot to the locals and he's only swam in it
once.</p>
