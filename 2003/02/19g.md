<p class=date>8:08pm CST Wednesday 19 February 2003</p>

<p>Janette and I are at Magnolia Cafe.  Fred will be here soon, and I
assume we'll have funny things to say.</p>

<p class=date>8:54pm</p>

<p>We're calculating the flow of the waterfall, estimating...</p>

<p class=date>9:47pm</p>

<p>Leaving Austin now.  We weren't as hilarious as I had suspected; I
got to tell a lot of Hawaii stories to Fred and some old school YRUU
stories to both Janette and Fred.</p>

<p>But mostly it was great to see Freddo.</p>

<p>We guesstimated 15 square feet of water poured over the waterfall
at 7.3 feet per second =~ 100 cubic feet per second.  But the
calculations were ended when we couldn't get a good estimate for
converting cubic feet to gallons.  Too much trouble to convert cubic
feet to cubic inches to cubic centimeters to cubic liters and then
estimate to gallons.</p>

<p>But mostly it was great to see Fred.</p>
