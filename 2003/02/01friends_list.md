<p>A couple days ago I removed 3 names from my LJ friends list.
Adrienne, Chez's cousin Paul, and Megan I think.  Adrienne emailed me,
asked me why I had removed her.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>I told her it was because of the length of her entries, and though
I encourage long journal entry writing, I don't have the
patience/attention to read long entries. I think journals out to be
written for ourselves, not written for others.  (That's a big fat hard
thing to do with my journal online, but I'm getting better at writing
more of what I would write in my private book.)</p>

<p>Then I went to her journal and find that the recent 20 entries
aren't all that long.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>I read through the remains of my friends list and find that I
wasn't really reading most of the entries.  Only about 3 or 4 people's
entries do I read.  Maybe more.  I seem to read the entries of people
who I know well.  That makes sense.</p>

<p>So, do I go slaughter more of my friends list?  Alienate more people?</p>

<p>I've got too much fucking internet stuff on my daily plate already:
emails, email lists, friends lists, writing my own journal, world
news... argh fuck.</p>

<p>I'm on the edge of a cleaning mode, where I might just shred my LJ
friends list or erase it altogether.  But I know I won't erase it
altogether.</p>
