<p>Just got back.  Jaimie and a local cat named Wally were chillin' at
the picnic tables out front.  Wally had a Winnie the Pooh stocking cap
on and was all, "when else have you seen a Winnie the Pooh gangsta?"
as he did the stereotypical folded arms way up high.  Funny.  He
offered me a hit of what appeared to be a fat blunt, but I politely
declined.  If it was what I think, it's the biggest I've seen in real
life.</p>
