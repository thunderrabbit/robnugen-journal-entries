<p>Now we're at someone's house in the middle of forest.</p>

<p>Met Djinn Jah and Ashira, who are on the fourth day of a ten day
fast.  They might not finish all ten days as this is their first
cleansing fast.  Master cleanse, I think they said.</p>

<p>They are living on 3.4 acres of land that some cat owns and is
building a house on it.  Zach lives there too, in a secluded tent
tucked away in a bamboo forest.  So awesome.</p>
