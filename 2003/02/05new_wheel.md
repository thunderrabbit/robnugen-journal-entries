<p>Helped Janette install a new wheel on an antique table she
installed at some people's house.  The table had three wheels intact,
but four legs.  An old chamber pot full of wheels offered one that was
nearly perfect in size and design.</p>

<p>Afterward we decided to go see if the lake spillway is very flooded
after the rain today.  It wasn't so we climbed down the slick bank to
the island in the middle of the river below the spillway.  Wandered
around a bit and thanked the trees for shading us from some of the
rain.</p>

<p>Janette is so much fun!</p>
