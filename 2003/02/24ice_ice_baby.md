<p>Alright stop
<br>shut down the city
<br>ice is back
<br>and looks so pretty
<br>something
<br>covered the streets lightly
<br>snowed like a monsoon
<br>frozen all nightly
<br>
<br>will it ever stop?
<br>
<br>yo, I dunno
<br>actually the sleet is ice, not snow
<br>to the the extreme
<br>throughout the night like a vandal
<br>shut down the city 
<br>worse than the latest scandal</p>

<p>Yeah kinda lame, but this commemerates the Great Ice Storm of 2003
over Dallas.  Though just now it seems to be letting up.  There's
sleet about 3 inches thick over everything.</p>

<p>I drove Scott off the street into the driveway in case people start
playing demolition derby tomorrow morning instead of staying in bed.</p>

<p>It was impossible to see through the windshield covered in ice,
plus my contacts were out so I couldn't see anyway.  But I drove with
the car door opened and got Scott parked behind Janette's van well and
easily enough that one might not have guessed I couldn't see
clearly.</p>
