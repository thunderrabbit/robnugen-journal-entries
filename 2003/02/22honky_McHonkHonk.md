<p>On the way to Sean's Ultimate game, while we were mostly lost (with
bad directions, not a bad driver) a woman was all honking at us, for
no apparent reason.  She looked over, but didn't gesture like "hey
your car is on fire" or "you have three flat tires" or "you cut me off
you <em>bitch</em>," but just had a blank look like we should know wtf
she meant.</p>
