<p>Sometimes I think before I write, to sketch ideas out in my head
first, but I can't do that now; I immediately fall asleep.</p>

<p>Chez and I chatted on the couch after I helped her change her tire.
Actually I did it with her inadvertant cheerleading as she watched.  I
felt really happy to have knowledge I could give her.  And really
happy that she was interested.  And really happy that she enjoyed the
game of trying the lighter adapter tire pump in both cars, multiple
times as I eventually figured out it had a power switch.</p>

<p>Chez is fun.</p>

<p>Pleased and (proud?) and happy that she correctly recited how to
change a tire, including every detail.</p>

<p>Blessed to recognize our soul connection from years and lives past
and future.</p>
