<p class=date>10:42am CST Tuesday 4 February 2003</p>

<p>Driving home to Dallas now.  Apparently will drive straight
through; I haven't seemed tired so far and only 105 miles remain.</p>

<p class=date>6:08pm</p>

<p>Feels so great to be home.  Rolling around town with Janette and
Jack, helping Jack (helping by riding around in the car while Janette
drove) deliver some newspapers (anti-war papers?).  Got to help
Janette seal another squirrel hole near the gutter by the computer
window.  The mom squirrel moved her babies elsewhere; they're no
longer in the area that we messed with earlier.</p>

<p>Josephine is home from school + working on English paper.  She's
feeling a bit sick.</p>
