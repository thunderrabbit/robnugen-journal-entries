<p>Met Karan from Sweden, and made the very embarassing "that's next
to Switzerland, right?"  Oh jeez.  No it's not.  Sweden is buds with
Finland and Norway.  Get it right, mister.</p>

<p>That's not what Karan said, but we went down to the world map and
she showed me what time it is with all that.  She's been to a million
different cuntries around the world: Thailand, Nepal, Greece, US,
Tanzania, Costa Rica, Italy, Zambia, and maybe others.  She said that
Dutch, Swedish, and Finnish speaking people can all understnad each
other.  But Icelandic and Norweigan are quite different.  I think
Norweigan.  And those last two are not similar to one another.
Swedish has the same character set as English, plus three characters:
a with one dot on top, a with two dots on top and o with tow dots on
top.  She gave me pronounciations for them, but I forget exactly.
like Ah, eh, and eu.</p>

<p>She's been to Thailand 7 times, Greece 4 times,  She never leaves
north Sweden-area in summer months of June, July, August cause the sun never
sets and people can go skiing on 2 meters of snow at 17 degrees C,
wearing bathing suits at all hours of the night.</p>

<p>Right now she's in Hawaii to escape the Swedish winter.</p>

<p>Next year she's going to Boliva, Peru, Galapagos and Ecuador, but
she's going with a group cause she doesn't speak Spanish.  I'm
guessing she'd be fine with English, but I don't know for sure.</p>
