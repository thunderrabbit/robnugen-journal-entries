<p>We're on highway 6, going north from College Station toward Waco.
A train just past us going south with about 40 flatbed cars on it.
About 1/2 of the cars carried two tanks each (not fuel tanks, military
tanks).  Then a bunch of jeeps and humvees, then more thanks and just
a lot of military vehicles.</p>

<p>What a  fucked up fucked up fucked  up fucked up war.   I'm sick of
our  fucking warmonger  motherfucking rich  white motherfuckers  up in
office trying to  take over the world for love of  money and oil.  How
the fuck can  I do anything that really matters?   I can hardly debate
someone about it; I just get  pissed that anyone can't see the blatant
obvious truth  that these guys are  trying to take over  the world and
crush all other cultures.</p>

<p>Argh.</p>
