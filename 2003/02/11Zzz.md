<p class=date>7:43pm HST Tuesday 11 February 2003</p>

<p>I just read my journal entries to Janette, during which time I
found that I scratched my glasses.  That musta happened when they
quite dirty after I played Don't Drown and then wiped them clean with
my T-shirt.</p>

<p>D'oh.</p>

<p>I'm going to read <em>Stranger in a Strange Land</em> using my
laptop screen as a multi-thousand dollar night light until we fall
asleep.</p>
