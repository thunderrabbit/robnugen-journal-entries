<p>Whoooooo hoooooooooo.</p>

<p>The hostel is phat funky awesome and allll that excellentness.</p>

<p>We paid for five nights.  Reenie is off looking for her son, who
works at a restaurant that turns out to be in walking distance from
here.  Amazing cause it's not a small island.  Maybe it's only really
populated on this side.</p>

<p>Most awesome pimp ass situation.</p>
