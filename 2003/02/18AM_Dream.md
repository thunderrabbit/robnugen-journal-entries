<p class=date>6:27am HST Tuesday 18 February 2003</p>

<p class=dream>I was at a UU conference including adults and youth
like GA or SWUUSI and sitting with the youth and my mom came in,
looking to me like Julia Roberts.  I asked Kate Robinson "doesn't she
look like Julia Roberts?"</p>

<p class=dream>"A little bit"</p>

<p class=dream>But no she really did look like her and then she was
looking around (my mom was looking around) and she found me and said
HI then saw some of her friends were crying and my mom started crying
and I knew immediately that meant we had started to bomb Iraq.</p>

<p class=dream>I ran outside the conference center and started
screaming until my throat was raw "GODDAMMIT MOTHERFUCKING GEORGE
DOUBLE YOU BUSH I TOLD YOU TO NOT FUCKING BOMB IRAQ!! YOU ARE SUCH A
FUCKING MORONIC MOTHERFUCKING POMPOUS ASSHOLE OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE
AND I WANT YOU TO STOP THIS WAR <em>RIGHT NOW</em>"</p>

<p class=dream>And my throat was so raw that nothing but squeaks were
coming out and I keep thinking about Ginnie's hunger strike on the
steps of the Texas state capitol.  I wonder if I could do that at the
white house?  It's fucking snowing like a bitch up there apparently;
I'd have to make it a clothing strike as well or get some clothes.</p>
