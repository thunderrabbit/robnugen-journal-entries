Dear Robert,

We hope your preparations for Japan are going well.

You recently received a letter from our office requesting that you
provide us with flight information by February 25, 2003. We have yet to
receive this information and ask that you contact us about your
status.

Your immediate attention to this matter is greatly appreciated. We
look forward to speaking with you soon.

Regards,

Hi guys

I am in Hawaii now and will be back in Dallas by February 20.  I will
schedule my flight and let you know the dates.

Can you check to verify that the letter was sent to my address in
Dallas?  If the letter was not sent there, then please let me know via
email what paramaters are allowable for my flight.

I'll call you guys when I get back if there are any problems.

	Thanks!
	- Rob

<br>I think I accidentally sent a blank comment page prior to sending this note to you.  Anyway, I haven't been keeping up with all of your global adventures since you met my boyfriend Jan on Southwest Airlines back in February.  I had a couple of surgeries that had me on my ass for a while.  (**Remember I'm the flight attendant who has been having great mind-blowing sex with Jan for years :-)  It seems like you had a great time in Hawaii.  I am glad you didn't kill yourself.  That would have sucked.  I thought the lady from security and the wall incident was fuckin' hilarious.  I have to agree with you on the liability law bullshit. <br>
<br>
Just wanted to drop you a few lines to let you know that I love your site.  Thanks for sharing.<br>

P.S.  By the way, Jan and his buddies from the group who performed "Oh Sheila" (Ready for the World) are being honored (no, not inducted; that would be awesome) at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in June. Isn't that great!  I get to go too.  Bye Rob!
