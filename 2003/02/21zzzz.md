<p>Been emailing/phoning with Fred; he's helping me some with my
website.  I'm trying to set up a cool way to basically prepend my
navigation buttons at the top of my pages.  I'm trying a technique of
using a script that takes as a parameter the requested
dir/ectory/file.html that a person wants, writes the navigation
buttons, then writes the results of a GET request of my own site of
that directory and filename.</p>

<p>But for some reason it's not really working.  I can return the
result of a GET request from google.com, but not robnugen.com.  Dunno
why.</p>

<p>Going to watch a movie now.</p>
