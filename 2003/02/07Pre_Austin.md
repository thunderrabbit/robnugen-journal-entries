<p class=date>1:09pm CST Friday 7 February 2003</p>

<p>I'm packed for Hawaii: 2 shorts, 2 shirts, 2 unders, 2 socks, 2
sandals, 1 trunks, 1 towel, 1 computer, 1 book, 1 toiletries bag, 1
gilligan hat.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to get some cash to enter in wheresgeorge.com and
wait for Janette to return from getting her van's fuel injectors
cleaned and we'll roll out.</p>

<p class=date>2:06pm</p>

<p>Bills entered. So far 82 bills worth $3159.  Leaving soon!</p>
