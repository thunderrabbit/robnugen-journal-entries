<p class=date>9:59pm CST Saturday 1 February 2003</p>

<p>Maggie just called; she locked her keys in her car.  In Pearland.
That's not exactly around the corner, but it is in Texas.  Even in the
greater Houston area.</p>

<p class=date>10:16pm</p>

<p>Got a map on mapquest.  Leaving Maggie's now.  Got my iTunes
rocking.  NIN happens to be on first.</p>

<p>How can I possibly have not written about the fun fun times with
Marcel, Adriene, Nicholas, then Kayse, Laurie, Brianna?  Legos with
Adrien while Marcel worked on my computer.</p>

<p>And talking for two hours with Janette.  Just lovely lovely
lovely.  How could two hours have gone by so fast????</p>

<p class=date>11:12pm</p>

<p>got a bit lost.  but I've arrived.  42 miles</p>

<p class=date>11:24pm</p>

<p>Hahahahah talk about underdressed with my T-shirt, shorts, no
shoes, in a crowd of tuxes, suits, dresses.  Walked out arm and arm
with Maggie, as she was wearing a dramatic purple dress with crazy
purple hat and purse and boa or something.</p>

<p class=date>12:09am</p>

<p>Back at Maggie's.  82.2 miles driven.</p>

<p>Wow; I beat them home!</p>
