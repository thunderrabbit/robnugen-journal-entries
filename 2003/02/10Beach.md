<p>This area is definitely on my list of acceptable places to live for
a while.  I wonder what vocation I could do for money around here.
Could be washing dishes like Zach or organizing beach cleanups and
somehow raising money or food that way.</p>

<p>This morning I joined Janette and Reenie for a walk along the beach
after getting some tastey beverages at a local drink shop.  I got a
mango banana soy vanilla yogurt smoothie, which didn't taste a lot
like mango or vanilla yogurt.  More like banana and soy, but hey.  I
cleaned up trash along the beach and ended up mostly filling a 40
gallon trashcan.  Probaby about 1/2 full and most of that bulk was big
sections of rope washed up and lodged in among rocks of a jetty pier
thing a majig.  Whatever one calls a line of rocks sticking out into
the ocean.</p>

<p>I felt pretty successful in my mission, also tossing an unbroken
clear glass beer bottle full of muck (Whatever one wants to call black
colored oil and poo smelling stuff capped with a layer of sand.  (I
made up the fragrance, but it looked like it would smell that way.)),
a plastic net flotation ball, and a large 20 or 30 or 50 pound piece
of iron broken off of what had been a square manhole cover.</p>

<p>Now I'm just kickin' it on the upstairs back porch of this awesome
hostel.</p>

<p>Janette and Reenie have just walked up; looks like they have a
small bag of food goodies.</p>
