<p class=date>6:56pm CST Wednesday 19 February 2003</p>

<p>The landing was like <em>WHAM</em> when we touched down.  No
bounce, but definitely hard hit.</p>

<p>Charles to my left had been looking out the window and then jerked
to safe crashlanding arms blocking face/torso position.  Jan and I simply
bounced and were like, "wow."  Jan said their friend in the other
aisle of seats looked all scared.  Good times.</p>

<p>Charles knew this was the pilot's first flight as FO (First
Officer) for Southwest Airlines.</p>

<p>The flight attendant was all, "ladies and gentlemen, please give a
round of applause for our FO's first landing!"</p>

<p>We all clapped and Jan was all, "if you can talk about it, it was a
good landing."</p>

<p>How true.</p>

<br>I really love your website!  I think it's great.  This is a wonderful idea to share your life with everybody!  I am a flight attendant and get to meet a lot of wonderful people and would have loved to meet you in person.  I got your email address from the guy you met on the plane today, Jan.  I have been knowing Jan for a few years now... and we've also been having great, mind-blowing sex for a while as well.  But that's a whole other show. LOL  He is a very nice guy.  I will be checking your site from time to time to see how life is treating you from day to day.  <br>
<br>
Peace and blessings,<br>
