<p>I have just posted a question to <a
href="http://answers.google.com/answers/main?cmd=threadview&id=158361">google</a>,
and got an email response from a cat named Todd after I emailed him
regarding Silent Football games he's played.  Turns out his group
learned of the game through some Unitarian(s) as well.</p>
