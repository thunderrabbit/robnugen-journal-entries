<p class=date>5:26pm CST Friday 21 February 2003</p>

<p>Today I was pretty productive.  Deposited a check for Janette,
converted a $20 into 2 dollar bills, bought contact solution, got my
airline information finalized for Japan.  Leaving 26 March at 8:40am CST from
Dallas, arrive in Los Angeles at 9:59am PST.  Chill in the airport for
a second then leave at 11:10am PST from LA and arrive in Narita 11.5
hours later at 4:00pm JST (?) 27 March.</p>

<p>All for $714, including 1 meal.  Aright.</p>

<p>Shit.  I'm supposed to bring like $1000 cash to get setup there,
but I'm down to about $100, and down to -$2000 if I take into
consideration my debt.  Maybe I can work at Wolf Shop some this
month.</p>
