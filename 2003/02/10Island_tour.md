<p class=date>2:27pm HST Monday 10 February 2003</p>

<p>Walked with Janette to get fruit and then munched pizza at
Blossoming Lotus.  Saw Zach and a girl who was "going back home;" she
turned out to know Zach; her name is Tamera.</p>

<p>Now Zach is driving; his mom is shotgun; I'm between Tamera and
Janette in the back.  Tamera's been telling us cool things about cool
places and people and languages.  She lives several miles past the end
of the road, which means literally that.  The highway around Kaua'i
doesn't go all the way around.  She lives right in the middle of that
11 mile gap, in a valley, with basically no people around.  She met
Matthew while he was hiking back there.</p>

<p>She told us about the pidgen language the locals speak, a wacked
out English, for which books are available.  The books are apparently
really funny ... and accurate in their portrayal of the language.</p>

<p>I wonder if Hawaiian will be my third language in which I'll become
conversant.</p>

<p>She's living illegally; I didn't realize that it's "totally
illegal" to live back there.</p>

<p>How weird for it to be "illegal" to live back there.  How did these
lawmakers get the right to make such laws?  Pretty fucked up.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, does your watch tell the year?"  That's Tamera when she
comes out of the valley.</p>

<p class=date>3:13pm</p>

<p>We have just arrived at the end of the road.  "BEACH CLOSED" while
bunches of people are on the beach.  Hahahahah</p>
