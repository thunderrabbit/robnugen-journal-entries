<p>Met Jeff, proprietor cat of Aloha Dude internet access.  He's quite
friendly so be sure to go by next time you're kickin' it Kaua'i style.
Zach says it's a good price for access, *AND* he prorated my time
after the first fifteen minutes.  Nice.</p>

<p>First good thing was him appreciating Macs over Windows-crippled PCs.</p>

<p>He pimped Poliholi, which is apparently at the other end of the
road.</p>

<p>AANNnnd he let me enter into wheresgeorge the serial numbers of the
bills I got back for change after paying him for my time.</p>
