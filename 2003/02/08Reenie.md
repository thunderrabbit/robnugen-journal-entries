<p>Reenie's actual name is Maureen.  But she's Reenie from now on in
here.  She goes by Reen in the real world, but Janette calls her
Reenie.</p>

<p>Reenie wasn't allowed to bring scissors through the checkpoint, so
she <em>mailed</em> them back to herself at her house.  "But what if I
need to trim my <em>bangs</em>???  Is that such a terrible thing?  I'm
no terrorist; I just don't want to be a fashion disaster on Hawaii, of
course!"  I made that last sentence up, but she was saying some funny
shit like that.</p>
