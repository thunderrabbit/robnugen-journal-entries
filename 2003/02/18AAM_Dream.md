<p class=dream>Mark Leonard was there when I got a job in sales for a
software company and he immediately helped me with some advice that
was wisdom in his mind that I simply didn't have (or actually do cause
it was my dream) he was all, "now what you could do is have some guys
run around and get people to fill out questionaires to prequalify
customers for the software.  Pay these guys maybe per page they turn
back in."</p>

<p class=dream>I was all "should I pay them a dollar per page
(name)?"</p>

<p class=dream>"I wouldn't even pay them that much."</p>

<p class=dream>And it's like bam that was a perfect little plan to
help.  I hadn't even gotten business cards yet.</p>

<p class=dream>Then a guy drove up in a van and was lost.  He showed
me on a map where he intended to go, and apparently got confused with
the opposite-ness of highway 59.</p>

<p class=dream>I showed him where on the map he was, drew out a
correct simplified map of how to get back where he wanted to go,
taking into consideration construction concerns and all that, and oh
and he spoke only Spanish so I was crossing a language barrier as well
and I was really able to help this guy out.  His wife and son were in
the van anxious to go, but me and this guy were really connecting and
it was great.</p>

<p class=dream>They left for a second and he was playing a CD for me
and they came back and I was all, "here they are you gotta go" and he
didn't want to go, but did.  I gave him my adventure card.</p>

<p>The point as I see it from these dreams is that I am better suited
for some jobs (giving directions) than other jobs (sales).</p>
