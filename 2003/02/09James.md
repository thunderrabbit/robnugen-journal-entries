<p class=date>8:35am HST Sunday 9 February 2003</p>

<p>Met a cool cat named James and his girl (didn't get her name) on
the shuttle bus from Waikiki area to the airport.  They were en route
to check out the Arizona; they had seen the Missouri yesterday.</p>

<p>James drives trucks across the country in 2.5 days from New York
City (where he grew up) to LA.  Takes different routes depending on
the weather.  He's seen the white buffalo in Colorado, which Janette
assures him is good luck.  "It gives you good luck and good looks."</p>

<p>He really pimped Germain's Luau, saying it was really pimp and his
girl had gone parasailing which was quite fun, especially when the
boat driver would slow down and let her feet dip into the water.
Crazy!</p>
