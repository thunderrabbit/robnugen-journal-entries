<p class=date>11:40am PST Wednesday 19 February 2003</p>

<p>Now flying over desert mountains, between Charles and Jan, who are
both employees of Southwest.  Charles is going to play football in
Austin (there's a tournament there) and Jan is just coming to chill.
Charles has family in Thailand that owns a 5 star resort and gets to
kick back in style when he's there.  Sweet.</p>

<p>Janette and I ended up in different seats; we boarded 3rd and 4th
to last.</p>

<p>Jan just wrote a song on two vomit bags.  When he finished both
sides of one bag I provided him with another, "just in time."  He
finished and then I was all, "is it a song you're writing?"</p>

<p>"Yeah" blah blah "you know that song 'Oh Sheila' ?"</p>

<p>" 'Oh Sheila, unh unh unh, Oh Sheila' ... naw never heard of it."</p>

<p>We both laughed.</p>

<p>"I helped write that song."</p>

<p>"That was Ready For The World, right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"You get a penny every time it plays?  A nickel?"</p>

<p>"Believe dat.  It's more than a penny and more than a nickel."</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>Whoah.</p>

<p>Jan's cousin is Tone Loc.</p>

<p>The lead singer of Ready For The World is still kickin' it solo
