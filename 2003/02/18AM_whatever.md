<p>Rambling through my head for no apparent reason is a bit of
dialogue in <em>Snatch</em></p>

<p>"We've lost Gogeous Geoge."</p>

<p>"Yor going to hafta repeat that."</p>

<p>"We've lost.  Gogeous Geoge."</p>

<p>"Well wheahdya lose him?  It's not like he's a set of fuckin' cah
keys now is he?"</p>

<p>Over and over in my mind.  Oh, and Mickey's punch that lost
Gorgeous George and the music that ensued.</p>

<p class=date>9:09am</p>

<p>We're leaving today.</p>

<p>Things to do today:  
<br>* Check email and see if I got Laura's snailing address
<br>* get stamps and mail postcards
<br>* go climb on something rocky and tall or rocky and wet</p>

<p>I just heard from Jeff at Aloha Dude Internet that Google bought
Blogger.com.  Whooooooo!  I love google.  Google is the only search
engine that I've allowed to crawl my site.</p>

<p>Found Reen and Janette on the way home.  They were oooing and
ahhing in a fabric store when I left them.  Zachattack hasn't shown up
yet this morning to chauffeur us around the island one last day.</p>

<p>Nim from Castle of Dreams has been in touch with me recently,
saying he and Deek were thinking about old Castle days and found my
site online.  He had a bit of problem navigating around 1997 and 1998
on my site, so I might convert those years to my current format and
leave the indices intact somewhere for posterity.</p>

<p>I added bananas to my computer.</p>

<p>I just realized that Madonna's greatest hits album, <em>Immaculate
Collection</em> has got to be a reference to the immaculate
conception.</p>
