<p>In Austin I helped Janette a bit with her space at UnCommon
Objects.  She's going to move into a new space there soon.</p>

<p>"HI Fred!" Bill's um-friend Amanda blurted to me as she and Bill
careened stumbling into the apartment.  She got to Bill's room and
hollered "I need a bath, Bill!"</p>

<p>Funny.</p>

<p>Janette and I are at Fred's apartment; he's going to help us drop
off her van at her friend's house while we're gone.</p>

<p>Amanda's in the bath; Bill put on some music; Fred's making a
smoothie; looks like we might be chillin' here for a while..</p>

<p>Bill put on DJ Shadow; we each talked about the times we've seen
him in concert.</p>

<p>Bill just asked again when we're leaving, and again if we're going
to surf.  At least he remembers where we said we're going.</p>

<p>"Thanks [Fred] for putting the plant on the table; it looks good
there."</p>

<p>"Oh," (smiling assuringly) "you're welcome."</p>

<p>"Did I put it there?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>Just got back from Fred's/dropping off the van.  It's snowing
outside!  Little itty bitty flakes, a bit flakey in coverage, but
definitely snow.  Fred showed us a $75 knot book by some cat named
Ashley, showed us a couple cool knots, showed us how he built his
dining room table.  We all yammered about this and that and the
others.  Fred and I told Janette funny stories and we generally had a
good time, provably so since it's so much later than we expected to
get out of Fred's, considering how tired he seemed when I first talked
to him around 10pm.</p>

<p>Way cool thanks to Fred for helping us drop off the van near a 500
year old oak tree for safe keeping while we're in Hawaii.</p>

<p>For some reason I did not bring a CAT 5 cable, so I might not be
able to connect in Hawaii, unless they're wireless or I get a
cable.</p>
