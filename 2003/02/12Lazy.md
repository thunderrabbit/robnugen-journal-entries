<p>Today has been lazy so far. (*) I walk walk walked toward the town
and entered some shop with lots of souveniers.  The cat was all,
"where's your shoes? you forgot them.." and I go, "my shoes??" like
his was the oddest question in the world.  His shop was hardly the
paragon of high class.</p>

<p>"Yeah, shoes, normally you wear shoes in public; this isn't your
house."</p>

<p>"Even in <em>Hawaii</em>??"</p>

<p>"Especially in Hawaii."</p>

<p>"Oh." and I turned around to leave.  How is he trying to be all
"especially Hawaii," where there are no poisonous spiders, no
thistles, no cold days, plenty of lovely beaches and soft grass and
climbable rocks that beg for bare feet???</p>

<p>"Can I help you with something?"</p>

<p>Oh, now he wants to be all nice after dissing me for not wearing
shoes.  "Oh no, not at all," I say without glancing back, and I
left.</p>

<p>I was going to buy some postcards, but not from him.</p>

<p>Shit, I won't even go into a restaurant on this island that
requires shoes.  There are plenty that do not.  All four that we have
visited were fine with bare footses.</p>

<p>I got ten postcards from a different store.  Walk walk walked some
more, found out where the post office is, will use it when I want to
mail these.</p>
