<p>Cool.  After a day+ of being close to blind in paradise, I'm going
to visit an optometrist to get contacts.</p>

<p>WOW!  He knows Dr Pickering, my eye doctor in Houston!  Dr Stan
Schiller was roommates with her husband Mark at UH!</p>

<p>awesome:
<br>* he was open today
<br>* Janette drove
<br>* now I can see!</p>

<p>Wow wow wow.  Stan goes kitesurfing!  That's what the sport with
cats on surfboards and the big lowercase n shaped sail above them; I
first saw this in California back when FSD sent Kevin, Patrick and me
to the SUGI conference a couple years ago.</p>

<p>Stan wrote Drs Pickering a note and sent some pages from a recent
issue of his kitesurfing magazine.</p>
