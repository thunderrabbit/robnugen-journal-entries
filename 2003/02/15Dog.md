<p>Just went to the Mother Of All Juice Bars with Reen and Zach.  They
left as I was writing postcards.  Before I was done Dog showed up and
I chilled with him a bit and yammered about all variety of random
shit, including but not limited to:</p>

<p>(!) the big flap of skin flappin' from his finger after he slipped at 4am
climbing up a steep hill thing and got some big ass sliver splinters
in his finger</p>

<p>(@) the predicted noises in Tokyo
whawhawhabeeepbeepbeepbeepshoowwwshooowwwhoowhoowhhoooyaayayayayayayaawhooeeeewhooooweeewooooowhupwhupwhupwhupzzeehhhwwwwaaabeeepbeepbeepbeepwubbawubbawubbawubba
(we made such noises for at least 2 minutes)</p>

<p>(#) my big monkey feet</p>

<p>($) his propensity to live chemically enhanced at night, and how
he'd rather promote weed than school</p>

<p>(%) the new styles he's picked up while living here: music, clothing</p>

<p>(^) new party/rave scene that is developing on the island.</p>

<p>I met his friend Jason, and a girl-friend(?) Amber, and enjoyed
sitting by him during which time about 10 cars either waved (*) or honked
or barked or otherwise treated him as a star.  "I like sitting here
pretending I'm a star."</p>

<p>He and Jason yammered some about local happenings and I gave him and
Jason my adventure cards then Jason rolled out.</p>

<p>Janette came up when our posse was ready to roll.  Don't tell, but
we're going to Secrets Beach.</p>

<p>(*) the sign language Y (pinky and thumb out, other finger closed)
back of hand facing the recipient of the wave. Oh and a little wrist
twist.</p>
