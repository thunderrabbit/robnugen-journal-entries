<p>I rode with my dad to get a tiller and 2 yards of dirt.  The
trailer tires needed air after the dirt was added, so we pulled into a
gas station.  It seems that when the trailer went across the (minor)
dip of transition between street and parking lot, one of the axel
connectors broke.</p>

<p>Dad analyzed it and seems we need to jack the trailer up, shift the
something and put it all back together.</p>

<p>I trust we can do it and still let me hang out with Marcel
today.</p>

<p>Took the trailer off the truck.</p>

<p>Took the tiller off the trailer and tossed it into the truck.</p>

<p>Going now to get a 5 ton jack.</p>

<p>Someone in a vehicle, looks like a drak gray brown Jeep Cherokee
type thing purchased at Copeland (here in Tomball) with TX plates F25
YPL, just threw a plastic bottle into the grass by the road.</p>

<p>They just turned onto Sandy Lane from 249.  Maybe they live back
there.</p>

<p>Have the jack from Dad's storage shed now.  Headed back to his
house where we'll get my car as well so I can leave separately if
necessary.</p>
