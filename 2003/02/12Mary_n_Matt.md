<p>On the back balcony, I learned the names of Matt and Mary who are
staying in the bunk above Janette and me.  Matt split to do whatever
Matts do and Mary and I chatted for a while.  One of her first
questions to me was "where do you go after this?" which I thought was
weird, but I'm all "back to Dallas."</p>

<p><em>Then</em> I realized why the question was posed that way.
They've been traveling for <em>six months</em> over north Africa,
southern Europe and south and central Asia.  Egypt, Greece, Turkey,
Italy, Switzerland, Thailand, Laos, Nepal, India, China, and others
I've forgotten.  Wow wow wow.</p>

<p>She enjoyed Thailand and Italy the most.  And they've found English
spoken in most places, enough for them to get around and speak only
English.  Coolest story she told me was how they connected with a
friend of her brother.  Or did not connect with her exactly, but were
invited to stay at her parents' house in India while they were away.
Only three servants were there to ensure a comfortable stay in this
mansion, but somehow they were able to make do.  How amazing to stay
in a mansion like that!</p>

<p>That's kinda like when Homer became a billionaire for a day.</p>

<p>Matt and Mary thought this adventure might satisfy their travel
bug, but the need to travel and see more has only grown.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Oh, and another cool thing is they *also* made cards with their
name, email address, a quote, their picture on it!  I haven't met
anyone else who has had cards made specifically for traveling.  Maybe
I'll put my picture on my next set of cards.</p>
