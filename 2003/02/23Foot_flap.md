<p>Went for a walk with Janette to get myself outside and off the
computer.  Had made it 4 blocks when I stubbed the ball of my foot on
a broken curb.  <em>Ow!!</em></p>

<p>I couldn't tell without looking if it was cut or not.  I hoped to
use my mantra "no blood, no problem."</p>

<p>Looked at my foot to find a V shaped rip about an inch long on each
side.</p>

<p>Problem.</p>

<p>Well not so much a problem that I couldn't walk back, hopping over
the dirtier parts of the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Janette and I continued our conversation about things I've learned
since 1997 (discussion manifested since I'm converting those entries
on my site) a bit, but this is another long walk cut short by
injury.</p>

<p>Janette had left a note to Josephine including, "I won't fall."
Maybe next time she'll say "neither of us will be injured."</p>

<p>Cleaned it up, including tweezers to get a piece of bark out;
neosporin; gauze; duct tape.</p>

<p>It still hurts.</p>
