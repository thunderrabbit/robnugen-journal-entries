<p class=date>2:26am CST Thursday 20 February 2003</p>

<p>We're home.  Jack is in Houston; Josephine is at her dad's.</p>

<p>I got a letter from Nova.</p>

<p><b><em>I LEAVE FOR JAPAN ON MARCH 26!!</em></b></p>

<p>I'm flying in to Narita airport in Tokyo, so it's looking like I
may be placed in or near Tokyo, as I requested!</p>

<p>I don't have my exact address yet, but I'll firm up exact flight
times, tell Nova, and they'll give me an address.  Whoooo!!!</p>
