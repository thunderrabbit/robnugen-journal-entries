<p>Woah.</p>

<p>This reminds me a lot of Costa Rica.  Magnificently lush vegetation
as we walk through the jungle on foot wide foot trails.  This is how
the island should be paved.  None of that asphalt crap.</p>

<br>We're at a waterfall, and Zach says the water flow is way way low.
Usually this whole thing is pouring a tremendous cascade of water.  At
the gushingest part of the falls, I tried climbing up the moss covered
rock.  Way harder than the rock climbing yesterday, for I had X pounds
per square inch pounding on my whole body, making it hard to even lift
a hand much less climb up through it.  This is what it's like to live
on Saturn, eh?</p>

<p>The water was cooolld, but I got used to it pretty quickly once my
mind was on other things like how the hell to hold on under all the
pressure.  Janette said Zach got some good pictures of me.</p>

<p>There's an old Toyota something next to the trail in the jungle.
Zach heard that it's only been here like five years.  That's
absolutely amazing to me.  I woulda guessed 30 or 50...  BUT I doubt
we'd have Japanese cars here that soon after Japanese bombed Pearl
Harbour.  Dammit, I referred to Pearl Harbour.</p>

<br>hi, i know i JUST commented on another journal entry, but i hadnt read about your "dont drown" games yet. a really funny game to play in the ocean that is actually a lot harder than it sounds, is this thing i used to do with meg in galveston all the time. you can only stand on our knees, and we pretended we were midgets, who's homeland was a tiny midget island far away where the whole population was midgets....kinda like munchkin-land from wizard of oz. some wizard (although you may pick your own foe) had thrown us into the ocean and we had to fight the waves (his minions) to get back. so we were scuffling around the ocean on our knees punching at waves and shouting curses as this evil wizard while trying not to drown. excellent fun. =0)
