<p>THE FUCKKING PERL HARBOUR MEMORIAL IS NOT THE HISTORY OF HAWAII!!</p>

<p>Jesus the fucking video that they're showing us on the bust (and
Ihave engouh problems with a vidoe on the bus at all I mean shit we
have *REALITY* outside the bus to watch and they are advertising all
this stuff to see but what, oh pray tell what gets fully TWO MINUTES
of airplay on this video?  Not about the King Hakeakeala (or whatever
his name is that I don't know because it was only said once and I
don't know the real history of Hawaii) but the damn Perl Harbour
monument with <em>footage of the bombing</em> and then two fuckin old
guys all "yeahp, that was a real good tour (of the memorial) if ya
wanna know about the history of Hawaii."</p>

<p>WHAT?  WHAT?  Good god man!  Get the fuck over it! The only reason
the harbour was bombed is cause we were taking over the island,
destroying its culture, starting with kidnapping the queen of the
island so that Mr Dole could have cheaper access to pineapples and
shit.  Argh oh jeez.  Okay .  Okay.  Okay.  I'm okay.  ish.  </p>
