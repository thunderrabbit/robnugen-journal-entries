<p class=date>10:52am CST Monday 3 February 2003</p>

<p>Was going to skate downtown Houston, but I slept too late to do
that before skating with Catherine at Memorial Park.  Great skating
with her and getting to chat for what might be the last time in a
while.  I keep saying fond farewells to my friends in Houston.
Sadness about leaving.  Excitement about going.</p>

<p>I already finished the three peanut butter cookies she gave me out
of her car.  "I don't really like them, but they're good" she assured
me.  Funny.  "Oh, and take these too," as she gave me more cookies.</p>

<p>I'm going to go say HI to Jennifer briefly at PT! and then go skate
downtown.  I have to do it for me.</p>

<p class=date>11:50am</p>

<p>Spent some time chatting with Andrea at Greenbriar and with
Jennifer at Paint This!  Andrea wasn't able to make it to my 12,000th
day party because a friend of her miscarried at 7 months.  Andrea
stayed with her at the hospital.  She told me her friend is taking it
quite well, trusting that her baby is in a better place and that this
is what's best, etc.  Andrea and I talked a little bit of world
politics; how cool is that??  And she told me she is beginning to
apply at PhD programs for political science type stuff I presume.
Awesome!!</p>

<p>Jennifer is feeling a bit sick today and will basically just load
the kiln and then roll out.  She told me Spot is getting fitter and
trimmer by running around outside, and can sit for 10 hours without
moving.  What a great cat!</p>

<p>Now I'm going downtown to skate.</p>

<p>Oh wait; I'm going to stop by Perfect Vision first to get my
glasses adjusted and say HI.</p>
