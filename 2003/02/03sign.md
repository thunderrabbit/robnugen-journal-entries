<p class=date>8:42pm CST Monday 3 February 2003</p>

<p>Went to Borders to join Chuck for an ASL class.  Fun to see him
again and see his new ear thing that allows him to hear now.  He said
he could distinguish the sounds of the guy pouring smoothies and
people walking and papers rustling...  Excellent.  He told us a funny
story about a refrigerator magnet sticking to the magnet on his head
that makes the hearing thing possible.  It took three neighbors
looking at him strangely before he knew what they were seeing.  Funny
stuff.  But not funny to one of the women (Michelle?) there who had a similar
device.  I didn't guess her to be deaf; she speaks without an
accent.</p>

<p>Got a URL from... d'oh I forgot her name..  Sarah I'm pretty sure
about these cats who had quite an adventure in Japan trying to get the
hookup on housing.</p>

<p>Walked out with Chuck, said bye to him and "see you
... whenever."</p>
