"Today" is the day the space shuttle Columbia blew up.  I'm kinda
sad about that, since the Columbia was the original vehicle.  Now it's
no longer the hardworking workhorse in my mind, proudly flying for all
these years, still performing as well as its younger brethren.

Enjoyed watching Adrien play a train construction game on computer.
He likes the game a lot.  Interesting to see him build basically with
no plan in mind, but just tossing track sections together any way they
will go.  Marcel likened it to building with Legos and having to use
every piece in the set.

I'm tired as crap.

I'm sorta kinda beginning to write just whatever I want in here and
not worry about being prim and proper, about keeping consistency in
writing techniques or HTML formatting over a period of days.
Basically not caring about the possible existance of an audience.
Eminem is helping me get that.

Adrien wrenched my heart as they left today.  He opened the back
window of their van and was all, "Rob?  Um, can you um, come over and
play sometime?"   How the fuck can I tell this little kitten that I
might not see him in multiple years, so long that he'll probably
forget my name, forget everything about today except the lump in his
stomach that his simple query was left unfulfilled.   Same heart
wrenching as leaving Sarah in West Virginia.  Sigh.
