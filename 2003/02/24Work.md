<p class=date>9:35am CST Monday 24 February 2003</p>

<p>I've got work today at the Wolf Shop!  Schlepping stuff from the
shop and warehouse to the Irish Festival.  We'll all be
Schleprechauns!</p>

<p class=date>4:50pm</p>

<p>Didn't shlepp anything at work.  Cleaned up sawdust, helped Hector
move some masonite around, hammered grommets into some fabric to hang,
went to a 6 day old Mexican cafe called Cafe El Toro I think, ate five
burritos for a dollar each, got a free slice of flan, and free sample
of their fajita meat, and talked to the owner guy who does not yet
have a license to cook food there, so he cooks at another restaurant
and carts it over here.  I spoke some Spanish with him.  Fun.  Back at
work I watched in amazement as Sergey created gray backpaint by
pouring every leftover color into one big bucket.  (No matter what
colors he poured in, it stayed gray.  Magic.) Back-painted some stairs
with Lisa, taped up a box, drove Lisa to her house, came home.</p>

<p>Today was Lisa's first day at the shop.  She seemed a bit unsure of
herself which I can understand. </p>
