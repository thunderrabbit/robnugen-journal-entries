<p>Met Matias today.  Actually Reenie and Janette were talking with
him.  He's from Germany, and is currently on a 15 flight round the
world tour for $2000 to cover airfare.  Any 15 flights he wants, under
certain mileage restrictions.  He's working on the latter legs of his
trip now.</p>

<p>He started out in New Zealand and flew from there to Tonga, which
is a set of about 100 islands, one of which is owned by Marlon
Brando.  He showed us a bunch of pictures and it all looks really
cool.  He also said Thailand is pretty phat, though he got sick
there.  (Mary, Matias, Karan all liked Thailand)</p>

<p>He works for a hostel in Dusseldorf, Germany. 150 beds so
it's for groups more than for meeting cool cats like him on trips
around the world.</p>
