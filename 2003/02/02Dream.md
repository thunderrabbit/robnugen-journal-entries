<p class=date>8:58am CST Sunday 2 February 2003</p>

<p class=dream>Driving by a big field with a large flat rock and a
bunch of guys sitting on the rock, all wearing construction outfits, i
turned around and walked up all barefoot to say HI and figure out why
a bunch of guys wer sitting on this large flat rock.</p>

<p class=dream>I got a bit good naturedly harassed for no soes and
ignored it, "Well it doesn't take shoes to sit on a big rock.  What
are you guys doing?</p>

<p class=dream>And it turned out they were all painting like
transcribing from canvas paintings, they wre painting onto newspaper
that had been layed across the rock, and the idea was they would place
colored tiles on the rock to fit the image.  There was a painting with
a little bit of landscape and a small tree and some red sky for a
sunset image and the red paint was still wet.  I acidentally touched
it and then touced the whit ground under the horizon line, placing a
red dot on the canvas, not on the newspaper.  Since the newspaper had
already been painted, it did not include the dot.  I told them, "I
fucked something p, I put a red dot on the canvas here, but it's
already been painted to the newspaper."  "Oh, don't worry about it; if
the touch up person comes back through and puts a red dot there it's
okay.  I like it better with the red dot."  "I'm gonna come back by
again in a few years and if that red dot is there, I'll be all 'I put
that red dot there!' 'No you didn't' 'Yes I did!'"</p>
