<p>I went in to work around 1pm.  Upon arrival at the Wolf Shop, I
found the parking lot like a smooth white lake of ice.  Awwwwww yeah.
Sliiiiidee Sliiiiiddee voooooom sliiiiiiiiiiide spiiiiiiiiin
sliiiiiiiiiiiide so much fun fun fun fun!</p>

<p>I kept toward the cleaner icey parts, mostly away from obstacles,
most notably Johnny's truck.  (eeeek)</p>

<p>Slid around for probaby 2 minutes before parking and clocking
in.</p>
