<p>Wow.  Josephine just described all the verb tenses she knows in
French.</p>

<p>Last night we all piled into Janette's bed to watch a movie.  I
fell asleep in about 40 seconds, according to them when I told them
the last thing I saw.</p>

<p>I had a dream that I ended up next to Josephine and we were
yammering, but I was surprised that I could possibly have somehow
shifted to the other side of the bed and thought this must be a dream,
but I looked around and everything looked correct.  Including the wall
hanging (that does not exist above Janette's bed).</p>

<p>We three are now seeking Sean and his ultimate peeps.  It's taken
us a while; they seem to have changed fields a couple times.  I dunno
exactly.</p>

<p>We've just found their field.</p>

<p class=date>1:43pm</p>

<p>As in, we just found the field where everyone had started, but
Sean's team was moved to a different set of fields due to rain.</p>

<p class=date>3:45pm</p>

<p>We got to see their last game.  Sean's team won with at hard-cap 9
to 8.</p>

<p>It was a pretty close and intense game; I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Josephine is becoming a gas pumping expert.  This is her second
time to do it.  Sean is impatiently hurried to get to see his friends
playing in the finals.</p>

<p>On the way to see <em>Grosse Pointe Blanke</em> (I forget which, if
any of these have Es on the end) Josephine was expressing a bit of
cynisim at the state of US and world politics.  I can't really blame
her; things seem pretty fucked up.</p>
