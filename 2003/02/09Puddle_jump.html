<p>We're in the airport now, and there seems to be no proof of
electronic confirmation of our tickets.   We paid $72 cash for each
ticket.  The cat here at the airport desk is trying to get us hooked
up.</p>

<p>On the plane now.  Made it through the ticketing process; the cats
at Robert's Hawai'i tours were having problems with their e-ticket
stuff.  Then Janette's bag didn't have a routing ticket. blah blah
anyway my bag got examined through the security gate thing.  Lalala
who cares; we're on board.</p>
