<p>Visited Rie at her work, where it's pretty unbusy.  She had 1
customer in the hour or so that I was there.  She taught me some more
Japanese, well she showed me some more, and then even more when we
went over to Whole Foods to chat.  She showed me the equivalent of
blessings before and after dinner, and the honoring thing to say when
entering someone's home.</p>

<p>Hugs to Rie when it was time for her to go.  I wonder when I'll see
her again.</p>
