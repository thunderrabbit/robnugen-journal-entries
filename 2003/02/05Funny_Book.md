<p>Janette was all, "eek we need passports; oh wait no we don't;
Hawaii is a US state.  But I need to get one for Josephine so she can
go to France."</p>

<p>I looked online to see how to get a new passport.  "Need birth
certificate.." and Janette pulled a book off the shelf, removed
Josephine's birth certificate.</p>

<p>It looked like a phonebook to me.  "You keep her birth certificate
in a phone book??"</p>

<p>"No this is a what-to-do-if-your-kid-eats-a-snake-book."</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHahahahahahahahahahaa!!!</p>
