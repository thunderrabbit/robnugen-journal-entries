<h1>Bibby Blowout</h1>

<p>Okay, if you know me and (Janette or Josephine or Jack), you are
invited to a party at the Bibby's house Friday night March 14 - Sunday
afternoon March 16 (and beyond if it's your Spring Break)</p>

<p>Bring some kind of food (uncooked pasta or fruit) or a present for
Colleen Crotty or Ashley Powell (the unbiological twins, assuming they
will be here).  March 26 is their birthdays, and that's the day I'm
leaving for Japan, so it's a combined party for all of us but still
time for me to get ready and freak out before I leave.</p>
