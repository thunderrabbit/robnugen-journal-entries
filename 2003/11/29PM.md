<p>oops.  okay; I've read online for longer than I wanted.  Now I'm
  going to study.</p>

<p>Today was Rachel's last day at Nova.  She had a cute voice.  I'll
  miss it.</p>

<p>I got a postcard from janette today! I've actually received three
  so far from her most recent trip to Boston with Josephine.</p>
