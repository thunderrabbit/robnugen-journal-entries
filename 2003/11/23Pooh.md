<p class=date>11:53pm JST Sunday 23 November 2003</p>

<p>Work was aight.  Many of my entries start that way.</p>

<p>Watched The Royal Tenenbaums upstairs at Rex, Lubo, and Tim's
  apartment with Dan (my (only (Matty moved out)) roommate).  Karen
  (Jennifer's sister) and Grace (Jennifer's roommate) showed up for
  part of it.  Tim wasn't there.</p>

<p>Not the great movie that I had heard it is.</p>

<p>I haven't heard back from Maggie on a slight crisis, but the good
  news is that I'm mostly over it.  But not 100%, I think.</p>

<p>Gotta go to bed.  I think part of my sour mood comes from me not
  being able to get a sub for tomorrow (on one day's notice) to allow
  me to see Nami's performance.  Sigh.  If I leave work *immediately*,
  I can travel for 1 hour to see the last 20 minutes of the
  performance.  Assuming I don't get lost.  After the show there will
  be no time for me to say HI to her.  That's my
  judgement/understanding. ..  I think if I had someone to go with or
  if I could go for the whole thing (2 hours) I would go.  Part of me
  wonders why I don't want to make the effort to see 20 minutes worth.
  I have all the assumptions about how lost I might get while feeling
  pressure to get there quickly..  just a nightmare for
  scheduling.</p>

<p>Ah, here's the rest of it: I've not seen Nami for some months
  (since we went to Fuji-Q Highland together) and I was really
  looking forward to seeing her.  And I felt embarassed for saying I
  can go when it turns out I can't.   BUT, no I never consciously
  knew the time of the performance.  I think the Japanese style of
  not doing anything to make other's lose face is part of my pattern
  here.  I'm not blaming Nami for not telling me what time the show
  is; I'm taking the blame myself for having assumed something and
  not having verified the information.</p>

<p>Okay; I'm going to bed.</p>
