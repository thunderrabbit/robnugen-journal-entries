<p>D'oh.  Now webquarry sorts its files in case-insensitive order so
that flocks up how they appear on my journal.  I've been careful to
name the files so they show up in chronological order when they're
sorted in ascii order, not case-insensitive order.</p>

<p>I aksed the sysop about that too.  Barring a fix, I'll see if Fred
can help me build a fix into my journal.pl.</p>
