<p>Amazing.</p>

<p>In the shrine at Fifth Station up Mt Fuji, I stood in front of the
money dump box, unzipped the change pocket on my wallet, turned it
upside down, and released my fear around money.  Came to the mantra,
"I am financially wealthy."</p>

<p>Some money got caught by the folds in the pocket; I declared that
must mean it's still for me to keep.</p>

<p>Ma gave me 2000 yen to tide me over until payday in 2 days.  In 31
hours (midnight tomorrow tomorrow night)</p>

<p>Took the shinkansen home to Shin Yokohama, paid for as part of the
tour today.  Talked to Jana and Sharon in the *last* seat on the
train, which was the first three vacant seats in a row.  Talk talk
talk, ate chocolate.  Traded emails.</p>

<p>Got off the train, went downstairs, recognized I had no proof of my
ticket.  No receipt thing; I had left it on the train.</p>

<p>Cost to get out of the train station: 1900 yen.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>Train to Kikun from Shin Yokohama, (which I hoped would be rolled
into the shinkansen ticket) cost: 110 yen.</p>

<p>Thank you, ma, for covering my dumb ticket losing dumbness.  (all
but 10 yen, that is)</p>

<p>I'm walking from Kikuna to my apartment (1.5 local stations away).
Started walking at 7.  Oh, I called Shin to say I could meet him
tonight.  Wonder if we can meet and allow the universe to provide me
with some cash.</p>

<p>It's 7:25 now.  I've written these two entries on a swingset near
the train line.  Near the intersection of Tokyu Toyoko line and the
shinkansen.</p>

<p>walking again.</p>

<p>Home.</p>

<p>Shin cannot meet me tonight.</p>
