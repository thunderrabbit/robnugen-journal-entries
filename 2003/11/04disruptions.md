<p>When I got to the bike parking lot (after over an hour train ride),
I found that I didn't have my keys.</p>

<p>I used them to retrieve my bag from the locker at the park; maybe I
left my keys attached to the locker key.</p>

<p>The most troublesome thing: how will I ride my bike home from
Matrix in 24 hours if my bike is locked to the bike parking lot?</p>
