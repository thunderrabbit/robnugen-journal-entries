<p>This morning I sent pictures to the Justin G-something, the editor
of First Drop magazine, the bi-monthly mag of the European Coaster
Club <a
href="https://www.coasterclub.org">https://www.coasterclub.org</a>.
He's the cat that asked me if he could use my pics of Hamu-Hamu
Kingdom coaster at Fuji-Q Highland.</p>

<p>Of course yes, and those pics will be published soon.</p>

<p>I sent him the higher res, but rainy pictures of Surf Coaster at
Hakkeijima Sea Paradise today.  I'll write something about it
soon.</p>

<p>Maybe it can be my first published coaster article.</p>
