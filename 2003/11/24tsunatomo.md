<p>I understood my first verbal Japanese joke today!</p>

<p>I am "つなとも" with ひろ, one of なみ's tomodachis.  Wow I spelled
  tomodachi out without noticing that it's not English.</p>

<p>The performance was not exactly amazing at first; I was like "meh"
  but then it got better and better, with my favorite tapdance move
  being tatatatata back and forth on toe tips.  Sweet.</p>

<p>Okay, I've turned off my screen so I use less battery.   I'm on
  the train going home now.</p>

<p>So I was in line 45 minutes before the show, and actually 15
  minutes before the doors opened so I figured I could get some
  flowers for Nami, as suggested to me by Liz.  I wandered about the
  area and found myself at a park.  I wondered if I could just pick
  some flowers (not) but then on the way back along the same streets
  I had been previously, this time I saw a flowershop.  Nice.  And
  the flowers were only 1000 yen for a bundle.  The woman was just
  putting it together and I was like, Um cause I didn't want to have
  to order flowers and then have it go through some bureaucracy of
  flower making; I need them now..  but then bang she sold me the
  bundle she had just put together..  Sweet.</p>

<p>Um, so oh, so then I realized I hadn't put Nami's name on the
  flowers, so if I wasn't able to see her then I had no idea how I'd
  be able to get them to her.  But I suspected (correctly) that I'd be
  able to see her at least briefly after the show.  I found her in the
  crowd and gave her the flowers and she found her friends and
  introduced me (after they gave her flowers (yay) ). My 日本語 froze
  at first, but then I was able to get a little bit out.  Oh, and then
  Nami was like, "ひろは綱島ですんでます," and as Hiro was like,
  "where are you from," (in English) and at the same time I was like,
  私も and they were like, ほんと, すごい, and all that.  That's when
  Izu said "tsunatomo" which is shortened version of tsunashima
  tomodachis, or tsunashima friends.  I got it and laughed.  yay!</p>

<p>We got pictures and I assured Nami that I'm shy and then we left
  Nami and then they dropped me off at the train station and peace
  out; I'm alone again in Japan.  But I have a tsunatomo, who I may or
  may not ever see again.</p>

<p>The performance?  Well, it featured songs by Will Smith "Wild Wild
  West" and "Nod Ya Head" and there were some flamenco (?)  songs with
  castinets (sp) and some R & B songs, some jazz tunes, and a spoof of
  NHK programming, and it featured a cat named Chance Taylor, who's
  apparently famous in the US (on the tap scene) and he closed out the
  show with a solo, including him falling off the fucking stage as he
  was tapping backwards with his eyes closed, (I imagine, cause he had
  his eyes closed for a lot of the forward facing tappage as well) and
  I'm like, "damn G open ya eyes" and I was nervous that he'd fall off
  the stage again.  Anyway, he seemed fine and recovered as nicely as
  one can after falling off the stage backwards in tap shoes, (right
  at my feet, too; I was on the front row (open seating)) and well,
  yeah.</p>

<p>Um..  Nami appeared three times in the show, plus the finale with
  all the cast.  It wasn't like a play at all, the parts were almost
  completely disparate, with only a few segues.  From what I can tell,
  all the tappers had to buy their own outfits, as they were all just
  a bit different.  .  I wonder how much of a budget this show
  actually had; they did a lot with an apparently low budget.
  Specially seeing how I didn't pay for this ticket; I dunno how many
  free tix Nami got to give away.</p>

<p>The girls asked me if I have a girlfriend and I was like, def, in
  Texas.</p>
