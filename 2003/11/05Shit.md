<p class=date>9:38am JST Wednesday 5 November 2003</p>

<p>Woke up LATE</p>

<p>I <em>lost my phone</em> while running between trains in
Musashi-Kosugi.  That was my contact between Carla (for whom I'm
working and who called me at 9:15 to make sure I was up (I wanted to
be up at latest by 8:45) and who I then called back as was WALKING to
the train station (cause I lost my bike key last night) and told her
I'm late) and Cory (who I called after I couldn't reach Carla at
first) who then emailed me Kawasaki Nova's number which was the last
thing I entered into my address book before I lost it.</p>

<p>I imagine I'll get it back, but right now I'm visualizing the
Hollywood-esque camera watching the phone receiving a call but no one
to answer it and the caller going, "what tha hell?"</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>Okay; next station is Kawasaki.  Time to run again.</p>

<p>ps: I made the train at Musashi Kosugi, which requires really fast
runnin'.</p>
