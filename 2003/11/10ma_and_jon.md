<p>Fixed a problem with Kim Sawyer's website tonight.   For some
reason the sci-fi content was completely missing from the site.   I
had a backup and restored it.  Whew.</p>

<p>Ma and Jon are in town!</p>

<p>I'm going to see them (sneak into the hotel overnight tonight) and
go with them on their tour (not sneaking in) tomorrow.   Whoohoo!</p>

<p>Oooh gotta charge my camera batteries tonight.</p>

<p class=date>9:06pm</p>

<p>For some reason my name isn't on the tour for tomorrow, so I can't
go with them to Nikko.  Except *also*, Jon hurt his knee today so he
will forfeit is seat on the tour so that I can take his place and he
can chill in the hotel for a day. Very convenient.  Mental hugs and
love to his knee for giving me a chance to be harassed by monkeys
tomorrow.</p>

<p>I'm on Toyoko line train now, headed for Shibuya. Then to
Shinagawa.  Then to bounce over to the Prince hotel.  Rock.</p>

<p>Made it to the hotel with no problem.  Was able to make out the
hiragana and katakana on the station map to find generally where the
hotel was, read the English signage once I got near the hotel and
basically walked straight to their room though I had no conscious idea
which direction to go.  Though she told me over the phone where to go;
I didn't really draw a map in my mind as she told me; it just kinda
fell into place.  Sweet.</p>
