<p>I had a different/unexpected success today in Japanese class.  I
  was doing some grammar drills on some new grammar that seemed really
  difficult and I was like grrr and I reallllly thought あやな must be
  bored as fuck and that she was really patient with me and I could
  hardly believe it when she was like, "good job" and I was like "yeah
  right," but she kept it up and I was beginning to wonder if maybe I
  really was doing a good job (this is a huge point for me to learn as
  a teacher; I'm not good at saying good job if it's not as good as I
  hope, even if it's a good effort) and ANYWAY the point is あやな
  said がんばって and it made me feel better. Wow; how amazing is
  that?  I chugged on and got through the exercises.</p>

<p>ps: soon as I learn the lesson she'll teach next week, I'll be able
  to explain in Japanese that she said gambatte (in Japanese).
  Nice.</p>
