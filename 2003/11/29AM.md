<p class=date>8:14am JST Saturday 29 November 2003</p>

<p>This morning (and for the past couple of mornings,) my neck is
  really tight/sore/ouchy, so I'm choosing not to take my computer to
  work.  I haven't typed anything while at work recently; usually it's
  just on the trains that I type, and today (Saturday (my Wednesday))
  is quite unlikely that I'll get a seat on the train.  Wait, maybe it
  is likely; I forget. Anyway, fuckit; I'm not bringing my computer.
  I'll study flashcards that Ayana made for me yesterday.</p>

<p>Okay, see you later, computer.</p>
