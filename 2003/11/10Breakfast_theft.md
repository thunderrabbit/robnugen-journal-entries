<p class=date>9:10am JST Monday 10 November 2003</p>

<p>(btw, Becker's has a morning menu without a chicken sandwich. Bunch
of croissants and crap; I wanna sammich)</p>

<p>so instead I went to the convenience store and an old guy was
walking without watching where he was going and I was like, <em>hey
man, watch where you're going</em></p>

<p>Though he wasn't watching where he was going, the clerks were
watching.  He tried to roll out of the store with his 200 yen (*)
worth of breakfast, but the clerk pushed a button and called some cats
from the back who (gently) caught him and took his goods. I dunno
where/what is next for him.</p>
