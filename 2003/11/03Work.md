<p class=date>9:15pm JST Monday 3 November 2003</p>

<p>Work wasn't bad today.  I talked with Miki during my last lesson, a
>M&lt; no show.  Asked about her future college plans and such.  She's
not sure what she wants to do about college - go to the US or stay
here.  Lots of factors going into the decision.</p>

<p>I understand completely.</p>

<p>I offered her Satoko's email address, but she didn't seem
interested.  Fair enough.  A bit nervous, maybe.</p>

<p>Got a call during work from a woman that sounded like Miki (the
other Miki), but who I suspected was Tomoko.  I told her I'd meet her
after work at 6pm.</p>
