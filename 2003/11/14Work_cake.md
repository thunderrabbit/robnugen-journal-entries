<p>There's a student at KQ who I originally thought of as a barbie
living in a dream world bubble of wealth.  Her hobbies were shopping
and she wanted to live and attend school in LA and go to parties and
meet people.</p>

<p>Last I saw her, she was saying HI to Tomoko after I lost my keys at
Tokyo Dome City.</p>

<p>Today I mentioned that I hadn't seen her in a while (except for
that) and she was like, "?" and then remembered.  (For the briefest of
moments (not like nano and pico seconds, but maybe 1.5 seconds) I
thought I was mistaken) She was like, "oh, do you like Tomoko?"</p>

<p>"Yah; she's nice, but I have a girlfriend."</p>

<p>"Japanese?"</p>

<p>"No, she's in the US."</p>

<p>"Mm"</p>

<p>"So what's up?"</p>

<p>"mmmmm.  I have love problems."</p>

<p>And we spent the lesson talking about her relationship concerns
using the target languages "I (don't) like" and answers to "how
often..."  and "how much..."</p>

<p>I'm glad to know a bit more about her than nothing.</p>
