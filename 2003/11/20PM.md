<p class=date>5:52pm JST Thursday 20 November 2003</p>

<p>At the library (first I asked the cop where the post office was,
but I knew that wasn't the right word.  Had to look it up.
ゆびんきょうく) now.</p>

<p>Found a book for kids that shows me the stroke order for kanji and
then got kicked out of the kids area (along with several other
adults), so I got a library card and rocked over to Starbucks where I
sipped hotto cocoa and a cheezu danishi and studied more.</p>

<p>Um, roamed around Kawasaki area looking for the perfect place to
chill and study and type and found myself at Cinecitta on the
promenade thing across from the model car store on a relatively dry
wooden bench in an infrequently trafficked area.  Wrote a bit about my
adventure at Yomiuriland, intending it for an article in First Drop
magazine (coasterclub.org I think) annnnd oh, I have my cellphone on
my head (under my knit cap) so if I fall asleep, which I intend to do
soon as I'm done typin', I won't likely sleep past any phone calls or
my alarm saying it's time to watch Kill Bill, tickets for which I got
at 200 yen discount from a ticket sales place.</p>

<p>ps: the cellphone on the head trick worked well.</p>
