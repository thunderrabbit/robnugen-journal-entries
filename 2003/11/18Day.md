<p class=date>2:14pm JST Tuesday 18 November 2003</p>

<p>Grr Japanese class.</p>

<p>Got a new phone today.   Gratis if I allowed them to change my
phone number, but fuck that.  I paid 9000 yen and got all my address
book and sky-mails changed to the new phone.  Reason?   Better
camera.  egad I'm a nerd.</p>

<p>Now I'm about to be nerdy again and work on backing up my data so I
can install OSX 10.3 without concern of data loss.</p>
