<p>Funny:</p>

<p>(first, I'll say that I told our tour guide she should not say,
"very much difficult." I felt a bit uneasy charging in, but that was
the most rampant error she had been making.  (I didn't charge in while
she was speaking, but after she finished and we were on the freeway)
She thanked me; I hope she appreciated it.)</p>

<p>Then she was got on the mic, "My name is Hiromi and I'm here to
say, I rock the mic every day."</p>

<p>Oh, wait; she said, "at least one of you is an English teacher.
I'll introduce you a funny and embarassing story in Japan."</p>

<p>My version of the story:</p>

<p>The former PM of Japan didn't know English, so when he met Clinton,
he was all to his cat, "what do I say?" and the guy was like say, "how
are you?"  and then when he says "I'm fine," say "me too."</p>

<p>So Morisan was all, "Who are you?" when he greeted Clinton.</p>

<p>Clinton said, "I'm the husband of Hillary."</p>

<p>"Me too."</p>

<p>hahahahaha.</p>
