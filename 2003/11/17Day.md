<p>Yesterday I cried as soon as my mom left my field of vision.
That's when it hit me.  I'm alone again in Japan.   I wondered why no
tears were coming as we hugged and hugged then stood there in
Shinagawa station.</p>

<p>I still don't know why they didn't come then, but at least it's not
cause my tear ducts are broken or something like that.</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm not going to write a whole lot, but we went to Kamakura
and that was nice.  Saw a shinto wedding and went through the small
cave with tons of buddhas in it (and I'm getting dejavu on that
experience now, can't quite place it) and went inside the daibutsu,
but we couldn't go up to the top (roped off).</p>
