<p class=date>10:32pm JST Wednesday 5 November 2003</p>

<p>Just had my lesson with Shin.  Got fed, got paid.  Stanked like
smoke until I took off my two shirts (white undershirt and U2 concert
T) (using girl magic in the train station) and am now wearing only my
GAP hoodie.  Showin' a little bit of fur at the neckline.</p>

<p>At Miho's I put my hoodie and jacket in my backpack to hide them
from the smoke.</p>
