<p class=date>11:48pm JST Monday 24 November 2003</p>

<p>Having limited success with my homework tonight.</p>

<p>Problem 1: I'm starting the night before it's due.</p>

<p>Problem 2: I don't remember what was assigned.</p>

<p>Problem 3: I'm tired.</p>

<p>Problem 4: I'm not being graded on this, so I probably won't do
  it.</p>

<p>Unproblem 1: I see the value of doing homework.</p>

<p>Unproblem 2: I see that if I do homework, I'll probably do better
  in class.</p>

<p>Unproblem 3: I see that I have made progress.</p>

<p>Problem 5: There's not many days left in this class's semester
  during which I can execute the brilliance of my plan: do homework
  sooner.</p>

<p>I'm going to bed.</p>
