<p>Had two &gt;M&lt; lessons with what's-her-name (¤¿¤«¤³?), my Aries
  buddy at KQ.  She's 7B, and seemed to grasp well is/has and some
  descriptive adjectives and present progressive verbs.  Nice.  I
  hope to watch her progress; it's students like her that make me
  interested in staying around.  Not like to hook up with her, but
  like legitimately to just be excited for her progress.</p>
