<p>Amanda says, "say something funny?  No, it's too difficult."</p>

<p>Earlier she cracked me up with her emphasis/accent on the word
"heaving:"</p>

<p>"I went to Kyoto in April and it was absolutely heaving with
people."</p>

<p>We've been buds on this Hakone day trip.  She hates roller
coasters, skydiving and anything scary.  She's married, has no job and
is a published journalist.</p>

<p>In short, we have nothing in common until we found that we both
know a bit about the zodiac and have similar non-dramatic views of
religion.  (bad description, but meh (like our sense of religion))</p>

<p>We're about to arrive at the boat-stop in Hakone, but I don't think
we'll make the departure in 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Nevermind; we will!</p>

<p>5:00 ish</p>

<p>Boat was cold.  Big gondola up to the top of the mountain where it
was even blusterier and colder.</p>

<p>Amanda says, "I like the fact that it was beautiful and you could
see out to the Pacific and the sun was starting to set, although it
was a bit misty."</p>

<p>At the souvenier shop, I took pictures of the trick box houses that
I chose not to buy for Fred.  We did however, get him another puzzle.
I'll take a picture of it before I take it apart to give to him.  I'll
not let him have a pic of it; that cat is too good a putting together
puzzles for any hints like what the finished product should look
like.</p>
