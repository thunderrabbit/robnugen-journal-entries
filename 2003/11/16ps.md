<p>My mom and Jon are here at my apartment.  They're sleeping like
shoes in cloth sacks.</p>

<p>Got them in Chinatown and they were like, ".." and I was like, "I
dunno; I've never been here before."</p>

<p>"What???"</p>

<p>same thing that Sharon and Jana said.  "What do you <em>do</em>?"</p>

<p>fuck around on my computer.</p>

<p>At a lowpoint now.</p>
