By Jove, you're right.  Absent sock-chipping technology, though, i'm
going to bleach "1L" and "1R" into the hem of one pair of socks with a
de-cottoned Q-tip, "2L" and "2R" into the next pair, and so on,
because my sock wardrobe is tangible proof of the principle of entropy.

If they have a bit of communication, then in the dryer socks can take
turns being magnetized.  You might get all your socks stuck to your jeans
zippers, but oh, well.
