<p class=date>10:52am JST Friday 21 November 2003</p>

<p>This morning I was just getting up and just thinking how I hadn't
really studied, when ¤¢¤ä¤Ê called and was like, "I didn't get to go
home from work last night *again* this week; can we reschedule the
lesson?"  and I was like, "*cool*."</p>

<p>The lesson would just be ending, but instead, I've just woken up.
Mmmmmm.</p>
