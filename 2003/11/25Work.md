<p>HI.</p>

<p>こんにちわ。</p>

<p>The construction next to us has officially impressed me now.  The
  gray tower is suddenly tall and the crane can inchworm its way up
  and down the tower which has large (12 inch-ish) holes through which
  pins are placed to hold the crane in place.</p>

<p>Erik pointed out part of the assembly that I didn't notice before
  (the part that holds the crane above the inchworm part looked to me
  like the tower itself at first), and now it has all become clear.
  Wow.</p>
