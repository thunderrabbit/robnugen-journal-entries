<p>I'm on my way to <a
href="http://www.yomiuriland.co.jp">Yomiuriland</a>.  Took the
non-local train at Noborito, so I passed the station nearest YUL, but
it's all good now I think.</p>

<p>I coudl</p>

<p>Oh JEEZ!  I'm going to kill two things right about now.</p>

<p>A) This new OS X crap terminal doesn't fucking send a backspace
that emacs can understand.  Can't even switch it with the emulation
changing thing.</p>

<p>B) Trains in Japan.   All of them.  Especially the ones on the
other side of the station that go the same direction as the direction
I'm trying to get away from!  Japanese trains can bite my butt.</p>

<p>Well, one thing is good, if it actually works as it appears to work:</p>

<p>Nevermind. It doesn't.  I can't type Japanese characters that stay
in place.  It's a tad closer; emacs doesn't die, but the characters
don't stay on the screen.</p>

<p>C) I can't even type a tilde with this new improved terminal.  Bah.</p>

<p>(update: I'm going the correct direction this time.)</p>
