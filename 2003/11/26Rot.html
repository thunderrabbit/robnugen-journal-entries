<p>I'm just rotting in my room.</p>

<p>Anything on my computer seems easier than studying.</p>

<p>Good news is I just got 133 on an IQ test.   (I got 135 the first
  time I took it, which seems a lot higher, but oh well)</p>

<p>The bad news is that my JQ isn't getting any higher.  And I want
  to write about my conversation with janette last night where we
  analyzed my relationship patterns and tried to see why I'm never
  satisfied with what relationship I've got.</p>

<p>"It's a complete nightmare; I am always looking.  I never stop
  looking."  I'm always looking for another woman who will be better
  than the one I've got.  When I don't have a girlfriend I'm looking
  for a girlfriend.  When I have a girlfriend I'm looking for a
  better girlfriend.   This has never fucking stopped since high
  school.  I continually look for a problem with each woman I meet to
  get her off my list of possible girlfriends.  I spend all my energy
  on this.  Nightmare.</p>

<p>Logically I know I'm looking for something that must come from
  within me.  Thing is, I don't know what I'm looking for.  Some kind
  of connection with infinity and unending love.</p>

<p>grar (as Jackie would say)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>okay okay. I'm reaching into my memory that said I could see the
  value of studying Japanese, and I could see the possibility of
  learning Japanese, and remembering the angst I felt after I didn't
  study Japanese, and the pride I felt after I studied Japanese and
  got positive strokes (from women) after I used Japanese correctly.</p>

<p>Study now.</p>

<p>(where is the part where I'm studying for my own benefit?)</p>
