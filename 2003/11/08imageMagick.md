<p>On webquarry, shell1 has been moved to a new machine.  The new
machine has ImageMagick on it, which makes it trivial for me to tweak
images once they're on that machine.  (Trivial is a bit strong; it's
still a command line interface, and each file must be smurfed
individually, but) I am pretty happy about this, though I haven't
figured out how to merge this tool with an email attachment
extractor.</p>

<p>What I could do is send files to my site with a web form, though
that would require navigating a menu interface to find the files on my
filesystem instead of drag and drop like I could do with email.</p>

<p>Further, I'm going to get the new OS X 10.3 soon as I get paid (15
Nov) and get to Akihabara, which I have heard includes X and Gimp.  I
dunno how true that is, but I'm still getting the new OS.</p>

<p>It's late; I haven't studied, but I've eaten tonight and fucked
around online reading comics and trying to figure out why I still
can't send email; I have a guess that it's related to shell1 being
changed to a new machine; I wrote to my sysop.</p>
