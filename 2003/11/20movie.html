<p>Miki didn't enjoy the movie as much as I did; she left during the
Crazy 88s Carnage, told me she'd wait for me in the lobby.</p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>One time someone (Fred?) told me that Pulp Fiction is not a good
first movie to see with someone, so I didn't see it with Janis back in
the day. I don't remember what movie Janis and I saw that night
instead of Pulp Fiction.  I do remember that I ended up seeing Pulp
Fiction first with Amanda.</p>

<p>Anyway, maybe that goes for all QT movies.</p>

<p>We walked around the game center, then ate おこのみやき in
Azalea.  Same restaurant as last week or so.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I have to work; Miki is going to see her grandfather in
Fukushima.  I hope that goes well.</p>
