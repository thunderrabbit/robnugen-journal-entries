<p>Fun hanging with Miki KG tonight.  We ate at an okonomiyaki
restaurant; I was polite as possible; we served each other (she showed
the way) and chatted lots.  She asked most of the questions.</p>

<p>I showed her the Japanese I had written recently, including the
kanji for shinkansen.   She corrected one hiragana (the rest had been
corrected by Ayana) and I gave her some English grammar on 1/2 a piece
of paper that included a single "shinkansen" written on the top.</p>

<p>We walked around Cinecitta, and planned to see Kill Bill on
Thursday.  I verified three times that though there is a lot of blood,
she still wants to see the movie.  Yes, yes, yes.</p>

<p>Walked in the new building across from the movie place to see
what's up in there and were yammering a bit when she told me that the
UFO catchers had live lobsters in them a couple years ago.</p>

<p>"Miki." I said matter of factly like, <em>you know it's not polite
to lie.</em></p>

<p>But she assured me it was true.  Well, I have seen fighting betas
in UFO catchers; and in fact, that was only a few days ago (well, a
week now) right downstairs at the game center.  Kimashyou.</p>

<p>There were no fighting betas in a UFO catcher, but we walked around
the entire area, marveling at how people could be so smitten by the
games.</p>
