<p>Woah.</p>

<p>I've just spent all evening not getting much done but kinda
screwing around with hoping to find a way to more efficiently process
images and write my name on the images, put them on my site, and send
them to rollercoaster ftp sites.</p>

<p>gah.</p>

<p>AND some terminal emulation setting is different, or actually it's
emacs (?) interpreting backspace as delete now when I'm SSHed into my
server on wq.  I can change the emulation on my end, but then I have
to change it back when I'm done with emacs over there before I can use
emacs over here.  Pooh.</p>

<p>BUT, my problems are nothing compared to the people I just saw on
TV - some show (in Japanese) about Afghanistan.  That's some fucked up
shit.</p>
