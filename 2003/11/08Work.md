<p class=date>6:25pm JST Saturday 8 November 2003</p>

<p>Today work was aight.  Busy at first and then eased up after
lunch.  'cept for one class of four level 6 students, some of whom
were lower than level 6 criteria states.</p>

<p>During voice we talked about fashion.  I started off with this line
(of BS) like, "Today I thought we would...  um...  talk...  about...
fashion and the differences between um, fashion for um, younger
generations versus older generations."</p>

<p>That went over well once I resorted to splitting them into two
groups.  Most of the students wouldn't otherwise speak up in the
group.</p>

<p>After work I chowed a bit of left over lunch and chatted with Erik
about discount movie tickets and listened to Kathy (today was her
first day) talk about silliness and clubbing in LA.</p>
