<p>The cats beside me are talking about my computer I think.</p>

<p>work was aight.  I had only one class with two students, and one
class with 0 students, so I averaged out to 1 student per class.</p>

<p>The building next to us has a new gray tower crane thing that seems
quite sturdy and heavy.  We watched them use other cranes to put stuff
on top of that crane.  Big heavy orange crane parts.</p>

<p>Ah.  I see how this is formatting html.  The &lt;p> tags line are
being indented two spaces.  Fair enough.  I dunno if I like it or not,
though.  I wonder if I can switch it.</p>

<p>Um, oh the last two lessons were with Kiyomi and Morita,
respectively, so they were pretty fun.  I cracked the book with Kiyomi
only at the end, and with Morita not at all.  He said, "I can read the
book at home."  Wisdom from Physics 2.</p>

<p>This OS chews through battery power WAY faster than OS X 10.1.  Jon
was misinformed, or I misheard him or something.  Doeth.  Oh well.</p>
