<p>I'm really happy that it's raining on a day that I have to work.</p>

<p>Today I turned in to the video store a video that Frank checked out
but didn't return.  They sent us a couple notices before I found the
video and returned it.</p>

<p>I'm hungry.</p>

<p>If I go home to Dallas, what productive things could I do?</p>
