<p class=date>9:23pm JST Monday 3 November 2003</p>

<p> Called her at 5:40 (cause I got off earlier than I thought I
would) and she seemed to be not exactly awake.  So I said no worries;
go to bed kinda thing and then she said she'd be there in 20 minutes,
which would be 6:08.  Fair enough.  She would lose a point by flaking,
but at the same time I released her to flake if she wanted and she
chose not to, so no points lost overall.</p>

<p>We ate (om rice and spaghetti) then walked to Cinecitta and
inquired about tickets to Matrx Revolutions on opening moment.  All
sold out; tickets had gone on sale in mid October.  A lot earlier than
Matrix Reloaded (or was it Pirates of the Carribean?) but
understandable enough.</p>

<p>Zipped over to DICE, the new shopping megabuilding (not mega for the
US, but mega for Japan) which includes 8 screens.  11pm sold out.</p>

<p>But 11:30pm still had seats available.</p>

<p>11:30pm, eh?  Hmmm.  I guess I'd have to get a taxi home.
Hmmm.  I'll call Matty.  If he can go, we'll split the taxi price
home.</p>

<p>No answer from Matty.  (I wonder if he's out with his new love
("the only problem is....  she's a prostitute.") during his last
couple weeks in Japan.)</p>

<p>Hmmm. It's not that far to Tsunashima from here; I could get a
taxi; it's only about</p>

<p><em>oh wait!</em>; I can ride my bike!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Bang.  Got a ticket.</p>

<p>She can't go that late; she has to be up in the AM on Thursday.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Walked around a bookstore in the DICE building until they closed
around 9pm.</p>

<p>"See you tomorrow.  11:30.  Shinagawa, platform 1, at the end of
the platform."</p>

<p>As they say in Japan, "byebye"</p>
