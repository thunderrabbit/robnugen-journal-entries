<p>That went terribly.</p>

<p>Conversing happily with janette and I just had to get it off my
mind that I've been having more fun in Japan (going to Warawara with
Nova peeps, riding roller coasters, beginning to see more progress in
Japanese learnin') and I think I might stay longer than January.</p>

<p>She was like, "I'm cool wit dat, yo" and then I was all, "something
something see myself doing it alone"   I don't even remember what I
said, but the "doing it alone" words rang in my head like an ambulance
stuck in traffic.</p>

<p>mood plummetted.</p>

<p>I'm so sorry.</p>

<p>man, fuck relationships.</p>

<p>fuck being alone.</p>

<p>why oh why</p>

<p>what oh what</p>

<br>i'm sorry too.<br>
i have alot say and nothing to say.<br>
it is still a good thing to be honest.<br>
i will be ok.<br>
i will miss you.<br>
i seem to be starting everything with i<br>
i want you to be happy and healthy.<br>
i don't think it is wrong to love and be loved.<br>
i think being alone sucks.<br>
i liked having someone to come home to if only in my mind,like,ouo, <br>
i can't wait to tell rob this, o <br>
i must share this discovery/thought /feeling/sensation/ with rob.<br>
i think someday you might want that for yourself.<br>
it doesn't mean you are not alone when give your heart all the way.<br>
it's just sharing life while being alone.<br>
i really don't know.<br>
i haven't been successful in the relationship part of life.<br>
it's all theory on my part.<br>
i'm done.
