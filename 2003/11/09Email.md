<p class=date>7:47am JST Sunday 9 November 2003</p>

<p>I can send email now.  Have to use my local ISPs outgoing mail
server instead of webquarrys.  Kinda hacked that wq didn't tell me
about the change, but I'm basically over it.</p>

<p>I added a sort to my journal.pl so the files are sorted the way I
want.  ls can sort them anyway it wants and all is good.</p>
