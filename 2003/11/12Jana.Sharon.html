<p>Yammered with Sharon a bit on the way up the cablecar thing to the
freezing windy area, then yammered with her and her friend Jana after
we dropped off peeps (including my mom, Jon, and Amanda, et. al.)</p>

<p>They're good natured crazy fun lovin' American girls,
adventuresome, apparently hard working, etc.</p>

<p>But the point is they brought up a critical question for me: "what
do you do?"</p>

<p>If I haven't been to a bath-house and I don't go out, what do I do?
I could account quickly for 3 days: 3 theme parks. But what about the
months?  Studying Japanese?  Not really.  You know what it is?  this
computer.  This is my time-sucker.</p>

<p>Encouragement to get out and do stuff.  Not worry too much about
Learning Japanese; just get out there and dance.  Dance I said.
Salt-n-Pepper's here, inside my head.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
