<p class=date>8:55am JST Sunday 2 November 2003</p>

<p>I wonder if I'll make it through the day at work.   Getting up to
shower and such now.</p>

<p class=date>6:57pm</p>

<p>I made it through the day.  My throat was really ucky at the
beginning, but eating some soft food (rice and eggs and cheese
(practically Mexican!) which they call om rice), drinking hot green
tea and two liters of Pocari Sweat, and sucking on throat drops during
class helped.  During my first lesson, I spoke as little as possible,
which is certainly a trick when teaching a spoken language.</p>

<p>I wrote a lot of stuff down, and pointed to various words in
different orders to get him to ask and answer different things.  I
didn't let him ask me too many questions.</p>

<p>By the end of the day, my throat felt nearly happy.</p>
