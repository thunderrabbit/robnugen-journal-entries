<p>Went to Nikko today.  Cool temples, but not any more amazing that
Kyoto.  Actually less amazing, but definitely more out of the big
city.   Large 300 year old cedars chillin' nearby.</p>

<p>Saw a monkey try to come into the souvenir store / restaurant thing
where we were.  A woman on staff screamed "saru!" and shriek-yelled at
it until it left.  Poor guy is hungry, I'm sure.   I got a tiny
spec of a monkey walking on all fours down the sidewalk in a picture.</p>

<p>Mostly the tour was rainy and misty and cool-cold.  Not fabulous
touring weather, and still plenty of people and buses.  It might be
more fun in the spring.  But not January.</p>

<p>Nikko includes a shrine (temple?) where they conked foot-long wooden oak
conkers together and they went [CLINk] in one part of the room, but
then when he did it right underneath the dragon they went
[CLINKKKKKKKKKKKkkkkkk] reverberating for 10 seconds.  "That's the
sound of the dragon crying."</p>

<p>Took ma and Jon to the Mexican restaurant in Shibuya.  Jon lagged a
lot as we walked.  Ma kept up pretty well.  They were both tired by
the end of our adventure.  We left earlier than I would have, but not
too much so.</p>

<p>In Shinagawa station I showed ma how to get to Yokohama station, in
case that information helps her when the need to come to my area on
Sunday.  We'll see what happens.</p>

<p>Speaking of not knowing what will happen; I'm not sure how I'll get
home from Hakone tomorrow.  Shinkansen yes, but I wonder how I'll be
taken slash dropped off at the shinkansen station.  Atami?  Odawara
probably.</p>
