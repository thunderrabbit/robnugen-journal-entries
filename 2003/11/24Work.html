<p>Only three lessons before lunch today, but then only TWO lessons
  after lunch.  Whoohoo!  I taught one student twice today.  Her name
  is くみこ, which I decided I could remember cause I had her
  >M&lt;.</p>

<p>I don't remember her face really, but she was wearing a red
  turtleneck sweater.</p>

<p>I figured out how to remember ゆたか's name; it ends with か like
  a question sentence.  So I can be like, "ゆたかですか" and it
  rhymes and I'll be right.</p>

<p>(wtf, right?  I guess I am learning this shit.)</p>
