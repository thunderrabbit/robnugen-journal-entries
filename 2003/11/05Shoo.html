<p>I got my phone back.</p>

<p>Took over 30 minutes at Musashi Kosugi, but I got it back and all
is intact.</p>

<p>I told the cat I lost my phone and he snagged a phone from the back
that looked a lot like mine but he said it wasn't mine.</p>

<p>I'm like, <em>how do you know?</em> but I could only think of the
word "nande" (why) but not the full query.</p>

<p>He got an English speaking cat on the phone who was repeating in
English the same things that the first guy told me in Japanese (call
this number on Monday) and then I was like, "aight that's all good yo,
but can you ask this cat how he knows the phone he showed me a second
ago (*) isn't my phone?"</p>

<p>(*) by second I meant 20 minutes</p>

<p>And he was all, "lemme talk to that mofo," and soon enough I heard
the guy on my end say "murasaki" (purple) so he had assumed that by
saying pink (in my obviously limited Japanese) I couldn't possibly
have meant this light lavender shade.  But then the cat on the other
end of the phone was like, "Oh check it yo, I'll call it an see if
that bitch rings an shit" and sure enough it did.</p>

<p>Got my phone back.</p>
