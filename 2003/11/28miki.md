<p class=date>12:58am JST Saturday 29 November 2003</p>

<p>Hung out with ¤ß¤­ immediately after my work. Met up with her in
  Azalea and we walked to Cinecitta area (and saw / were seen by Phil
  along the way (eee)) and sat together on the steps (in the cold) to
  watch two water fountain performances.</p>

<p>She brought a tangerine, which she called a ¤ß¤«¤ó, but which some
  cat on the web says is not an exact translation; maybe there isn't a
  name for precisely what we call a tangerine.  Anyway, fuck that; we
  ate it and watched the water thing and had fun yammering about
  nothing and everything else.</p>

<p>She was a bit congested, so I suggested we send her home or go
  someplace warmer.  Went to Starbucks and had hot cocoa and more
  tangerines and a chocolate chip scone.</p>

<p>She caught the last bus home (luckily; we just left when Starbucks
  closed and walked to the bus stop and bang the first bus that came
  was the last bus that was gonna come tonight) and I fell asleep on
  the train on the way home.  Missed ÉðÂ¢¾®¿ù by two stations.  Made
  it back to ¾®¿ù before 12:30 which is basically when the last train
  comes that will go all the way to ¹ËÅç¡£</p>
