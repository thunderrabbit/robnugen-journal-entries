<p><h1>smart socks</h1></p>

<p>I don't know if they've been invented yet, but left and right
chipped-socks could react positively when near their mates.</p>

<p>I wonder if they could squirm toward their mates in a pile of
laundry.  Nah, robots would be more efficient than motorizing socks.</p>

<br>If they have a bit of communication, then in the dryer socks can take turns <br>
being magnetized.  You might get all your socks stuck to your jeans zippers,<br>
but oh, well.<br>

<br>By Jove, you're right.  Absent sock-chipping technology, though, i'm going to bleach "1L" and "1R" into the hem of one pair of socks with a de-cottoned Q-tip, "2L" and "2R" into the next pair, and so on, because my sock wardrobe is tangible proof of the principle of entropy.
