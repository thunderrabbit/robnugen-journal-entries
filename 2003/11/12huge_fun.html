Miki, Miki, Rachel, Rachel, et al, et al, were all there.  Really felt
good to be welcomed into the group.  Carla paid 2000 yen for my orange
juices and gyouza.  Kaori encouraged me to drink sake so I asked for
something sweet.  It was orangey and sweet with a little alcohol in
it.  Dunno what alcohol nor even the name of the drink.</p>

<p>Invited both Miki's to see Nami's tap recital on the 24th.</p>

used to be a kindergarten teacher, so (though no one calls her KG
Miki), I'm distinguishing her this way) thinks she doesn't know enough
English to go overseas, but she totally does and I totally told
her.</p>

<p>Made it home on the last train.</p>
