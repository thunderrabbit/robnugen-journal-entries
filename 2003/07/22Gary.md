<p>Okay okay, wait.</p>

<p>Today started poopy, but then I dragged myself out of bed and did
several of the "little" things that have collected on my list.  Buy
pushpins, mail candy to Elise', buy wide clear tape, call Rie.  I
called Chez too for good measure, and left a message.</p>

<p>Ate lunch with Jen and Olivia, saw pictures of their drunken
revelrie at the fireworks display with some Japanese we know.  I would
have enjoyed hanging with them (( but instead that night I hung out
with Matthew Cecile from OZ, which is at least as awesome cause they
know some fly places in the bush where there is *NO ONE* else.  Rock
on.  We traded hand-drawn maps of our respective countries and I was
all, "don't tell Frank" like 10 times cause I had been all, "um, yeah
a bunch of little states up here like New Jersey and all that, and
yeah Washington DC is in Maryland but I don't know where Maryland is,"
etc. We talked about the genocide our respective cultures has
committed against the native cultures and felt helpless about it.  And
we ate our 1000 yen meal in the safe comfort of the restaurant.)),
maybe next time.</p>

<p>Researched housing in Tokyo area, to see if I can get my shit out
of this apartment and move into a more immersed situation.   Emailed
Rie's friend and emailed Satoko (Nova student) to say HI and see if I
can gain a chatmate if not a flatmate.</p>

<p>(( after hearing from Frank there's a lawsuit against Nova in Osaka
because a teacher and student are like "shove off; you can't keep us
from hanging out," I'm much less scared about meeting with students
outside of school, BUT, there's a concern about letting myself fall
into old behaviors of falling in love and breaking hearts and all
that. I don't want to do that anymore, so I'm being quite forthcoming
that I have a janette at home, and I'm sometimes concerned that she
might feel hurt that I'm hanging out with others (and posting all
about it ..)  Ah well, it makes for good discussions. ))</p>

<p>I got a lovely email from janette, but I didn't call her back; it
was too late o'clock on her side of the globe.</p>

<p>Put posters upon my walls, mostly Matrix Reloaded promotional
stuff.</p>

<p>Played sega fight game with Matty, with both of us trying to use
Nina to beat Xiouin or whatever her name is.  We couldn't beat
her.</p>

<p>Matty left to get shinkansen tickets to see Fuji Rock Fest this
weekend, and then the doorbell rang.</p>

<p>Federal Express.</p>

<p>For me!</p>

<p>From Gary Scout Seven!</p>

<p>Quite dense.. what is it?   I look on the customs ticket:</p>

<pre>
         Commodity Description
           <b>REQUIRED</b>

 Granite Rock
</pre>

<p>This comes, no doubt, from his land in Colorado.  Pink and black
with gray flecks.  Like granite.</p>

<p>Gneiss.</p>

<p>But still no email address from him!</p>

Wow, Fed Ex is fast!

Conversation with Fed Ex lady:

Gary: I need to send this to Japan.
Fed Ex lady: What is its value please?
Gary: Uh, well... it's a rock.
Fed Ex lady: I have to enter a value, sir.
Gary: Uh, one dollar?
Fed Ex lady: Okay. Would you like that insured?

I thought that was pretty funny.

The chunkagranite is actually from Enchanted Rock. I know you have
enjoyed E-Rock in the past, just thought I'd send you a small piece of
it.

<br>hey, i'm not hurt about you hanging out with others.<br>
if you fall in love with someone else, well, that's when the whip comes down.(nice expression,eh?)<br>
 what hurts -sometimes- is that you are not Here hanging out with Me.  like-dude- we're wasting time.<br>
  <br>
  but i know,i know. it's not wasted and you gotta do whachu gotta do.<br>
<br>
here's what i think to  quell my doubts:<br>
<br>
                 What is mine will come to me.<br>
