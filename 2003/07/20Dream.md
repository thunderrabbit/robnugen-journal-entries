<p class=dream>I saw a funny commercial on TV about doing whatever it
takes to be successful.  Professional American football game, one
player was running down the field to score and the protagonist of the
commercial saw him, but there were too many players in the way, so he
ran off the field and around the world to plow the offensive guy off
the field just before he made a touchdown.</p>
