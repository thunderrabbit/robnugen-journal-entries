<p>Super duper uper looper special thanks to janette for getting my
computer registered with apple's protection plan.</p>

<p>Holy cow somehow I have switched this keyboard to have all the keys
in the right spot. So now I can type "quotes" and 'apostrophes' and
:colons: and _underscores_ without having to find them visually.</p>
