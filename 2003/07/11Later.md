<p>Gotta go to bed.</p>

<p>Got sidetracked reading about <a
href="http://www.mandiapple.com/snowblood/suicidecircle.htm ">Suicide
Club</a>, maybe the creepiest movie in the world.  Shinjuku is a
station I've been lost in several times.</p>

<p>Cory and I might rent it.</p>

<p>Have read <a
href="http://www3.tky.3web.ne.jp/~edjacob/saq.html">http://www3.tky.3web.ne.jp/~edjacob/saq.html</a>
which does confirm the families are charged.  Look for "Chuo"</p>

<p>Got sidetracked wondering how to win big at pachinko.</p>

<p>Wrote some emails.</p>

<p>Going to bed.</p>
