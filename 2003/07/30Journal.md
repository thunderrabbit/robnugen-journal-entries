<p>Spent some hours today messing with my 1998 journal, copying many
entries from my old static index directory so they can be used by the
new .pl format.  I haven't finished actually editing the files to
remove references to the static index, nor have I corrected some
references to images in that directory.</p>

<p>When I got to a stopping point, I looked up from my computer and
was surprised to find myself in Japan.  <em>oh yeah.  Japan.</em></p>
