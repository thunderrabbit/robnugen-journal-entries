<p>I've just done five lessons at KQ, and now, due to a tupatsu at
Kawasaki, I'm asked to roll (walk) over there to cover three lessons
while Benny stays at KQ and does lessons with the same two students
twice in a row and then one of those students a third time.  That's
fucked up.</p>

<p>At least the students he's teaching are bearable, and I'm not too
upset to not teach them; they're not particularly my favorites.   But
damn - three lessons with a body is a long time.</p>

<p>Oh, the point of this entry.  Earlier today Benny was all, "okay,
let's imagine you're the mayor of Kawasaki."</p>

<p>(blank stares)</p>

<p>"Is it mayor?  Who is in charge, who is president of Kawaskai?"</p>

<p>(blank stares)</p>

<p>"Okay, you're the <em>boss</em> of Kawasaki..."</p>
