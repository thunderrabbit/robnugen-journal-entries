<p class=dream>I had a dream this morning about kissing a woman.  I
didn't know her; just some random hottie on the street and I realized
it was a dream so I pulled her on top of me and we just started
smooching.  I was practically animal gross slobbery kissing her at
first and then I realized that wasn't too sensual, so I slowed it down
a bit and after that we stopped and just sat on the steps wondering
what to do next.</p>

<p>i dunno, what do <em>you</em> want to do?</p>
