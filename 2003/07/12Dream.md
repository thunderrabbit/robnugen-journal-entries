<p>With all the kangaroos in Japan, of course I'd have a dream about
one.</p>

<p class=dream>A young girl was waalking down a bridge, like a freeway
overpass and listening to a walkie talkie type thing to tell her where
certain people were located.  "There's a young woman walking right;
thereis a young man coming toward you," but it turns out these spoken
words were warning her where not to go, or where to go she came
running back up the bridge and then down beside it and jumped onto a
hospital stretcher next to a kangaroo.  The kangaroo was wwell
natured, and well trained enough to lie flat on his back.  I was
talking to the kangaroo and soon enough he turned and kinda was laying
on his side so I could talk to him moreasily but his huge feet were
kinda in my face and a bit uncomfortable to lie on, but we were joking
around and laughing, but his leg was kinda poking into my stomach, and
it was a combination of funny and painful and he could talk, but
didn't realize or didn't bother to concern himself with how he was
arranged.  So I was chillin' with a kangaroo when I woke up this
morning.</p>
