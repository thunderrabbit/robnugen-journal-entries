<p>I miss my bike, but I'm getting pretty good on Koko's mom's bike.
I'm kinda thrashing it a bit too hard; I think I'll need to buy her a
new one instead of giving this one back.   The back wheel is slightly
dented out of shape.  Just a slight lateral warp is all.</p>

<p>Just now a train went by just as I got off our street; still a
hundred meters from the bridge.  Previously, I have been on the bridge
while passed by a train and I've caught the next train.  This time I
was 100 meters further back.</p>

<p><em>I wonder if I can catch the next train.</em></p>

<p>I was (am) on the edge of late to meet Fumi, so I decided to go for
it.  This involved hauling butt (it's gotta be more than 100 meters)
to the bridge and up the slight incline, looking back over my shoulder
for cars trying to run me over.  Nothing beside me as I merged into
the bigger street (instead of onto the sidewalk like slow people do)
but a bus in front of me and two cars in front of it, trying to turn
left across my sidewalk, but they were blocked by the slow people
going across their street onto the bridge.  (remember these cats in
Japan drive on the left side of the road)</p>

<p>SO, I zoomed around the stopped bus between it and the next lane of
traffic (traveling the same direction as me), and past the two
vehicles just as the first one could turn left.  <em>zoom zoom
zoom</em> pushing hard up the bridge with a bus somewhere behind me
approaching soon.  head down butt up, passing the people on the
sidewalk as if they were <em>walking</em>, and crested the ascent and
then began my plan of attack on the intersection below.</p>

<p>80 meters past the bridge there's a traffic light at which I must
turn left to park my bike and visit the train station.  Usually there
are cars backed up at that light.  Sometimes there's enough space on
their left to pass along the curb, but most times that is blocked by a
scooter or the edge of a bus.  In those cases, I will usually slow
down and engage the sidewalk, if it's clear enough.  Other times, I
will slow down behind the scooter or whatever.  Rarely, I will zoom
around the right hand side of the cars and turn left in front of them,
carefully engaging traffic on the cross street and people possibly
going across the crosswalk.</p>

<p>This time, however, the curb side was clear and I hauled down it,
down the slope between the cars and guard rail (and small plant) and
checked the cross traffic, but had to stop instead of zoom into the
lane.  I zipped instead of zoomed and then accelerated to the bike
parking area and engaged the sidewalk without hitting anyone or
getting hit by anything.  Nice.</p>

<p>I tossed my bike up on the rack (4 feet up on the top row) and
scooted toward the station.  I made it before the next train came.</p>

<p>But, it was a Limited Express, and therefore didn't stop at
Tsunashima.  So I took the next train (Local train (stops at every
station)) and then transferred to the Express train at a station
called Jiugyaku or something.</p>

<p>Got a tiny bit lost by going out of Shibuya station on a different
exit than normal, but I made it to Hachiko <em>just</em> on time.</p>

ya swuusi was AWSOME. i seriously had the best week i have had in longer than i can remember.  i was so relaxed out by the lake.  i stayed up late attempting to learn new card games and dominos.  scotty forced brenda and i to meet new people the first night..although it felt awkward it was just what we needed to feel at home.  by the first real day i met a ton of people.<br>
<br>
i ummmm accidentally started to really have an intrest for someone.  Adam Lock.  yeah, you know him.  i saw him and was all "thats who colleen hooks up with....he looks like a jack ass"  but then he asked for a ride up to the store and we talked, then when to town and talked some more. i realized how wrong i was about my first impression of him.i do realized he messes around with girls...wich is a negative.. but he is a great person who has goals and who actually is still inschool and loves music.  he was dancing in my car.  singing country music and conducting an orchestra. i loved how goofy he was and how free he seemed to feel.  we had some talks about how he has changed and along the way has lost some friends.  i tried to kinda get the skinny on him and colleen and determined he doesnt have any feelings for her more than someone to  "hook up" with.  so, yeah.  i took a nap with him. and felt so cofortable. <br>
i uhhhh yeah, did more than a nap...no kissing no sex...dont worry no swuusi baby here.  <br>
i dont know rob,   it was sooo great to see a guy who actually cared to hear about you, who didnt care what you did for him and when you wanted to do something for him (bec. you were a bit drunk)  he asked you twice to make sure you werent doing it to  prove something.....(that didnt exactly come out right but you get the idea..right?)<br>
<br>
sorry i am writting to you... your the only person i know who wont gossip :)  your a good mom!<br>
<br>
geeze, i really started to like him rob. but i dont think he really felt the same way.  i mean yeah we messed around or whatnot but i THINK thats all it was.  i wanted to talk to him sometime but apparently he is always logged onto aim but isnt ever really there.<br>
<br>
oh, and i made colleen cry i think.<br>
<br>
frank walked into the room when we were sleeping together, we missed elections, and apparently...time wise... colleen balled in the kitchen.  i was going to wait a bit before i asked her about it.  and she didnt say anything to me...we drove home together.. so i think frank may have said something to her... perhaps thinking i was her....yah know.<br>
<br>
geeze rob.  but i did have TONS of fun.  such great people. it was exactly what i needed.<br>
<br>
ohhh on the other hand.  i have decided to for an extened period of time to not eat meat.  i dunno why.  but thats what i felt on the way home. and i really want to start ridding a bike again.  iuse to when i was younger...and my question for you is.<br>
what kinda bike is good?<br>
where should i look for one?<br>
and do you know if memorial park is good for bike ridding?<br>
<br>
(i am moving to memorial and shepherd by the st. thomas high school)<br>
so i will need a place to ride, or i can just drive to magnolia and ride there.<br>
<br>
i dont know.  this crazy idea came from Adam.  he rode from norman ok. all the way to camp. and his reasoning.  "because it was hard"  and i thought, yah know i just sit on my lazy ass all the time perhaps i should do something that i use to love and i know will be a challenge.  i use to love ridding when i was mad just to clear my head.  and now i plan on doing it again and gradually going farther and farther.   who knows what will happen.  and i figure if i really start ridding i could possibly meet some really gret people in houston.<br>
<br>
when you come back to houston, if you do, i doubt you will recognize me. i am totally a different person now.<br>
<br>
ohhh another thing.  when we were leaving on friday.. i went and fell asleep by the dock for a few minutes.  as we pulled out i felt like i had left everything there. everything about pat. everything about school.  i seriously had a cleansing feeling inside me. i felt totally free of all the worries i had come with.  in a  strange way it made me feel like an adult.  made me feel like all the shit from high school, the drama..all of it was just gone.  a fresh start i suppose.<br>
tomorrow i work for the first time in a week, i am looking forward to it.  i cant wait.<br>
<br>
ahhhh rob, things are great.<br>
<br>
pat and i are done.  for  e v e r.  it hurt a lot but this swuusi showed me that soooo many other people love me and will be there for me and that i shouldnt keep hurting about something i cant change<br>
<br>
wow, i wrote you a lot.<br>
<br>
much love<br>
