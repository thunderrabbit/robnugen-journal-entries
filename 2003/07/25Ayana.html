<p>Today's lesson with Ayana was pretty good; I did some cramming just
beforehand, which, in addition to some studying I had done this week,
let me squeak by with the appearance that I had been studying.</p>

<p>I seem to be back on the studying vibe, so I'll likely do even
better next time we meet.  This, however, won't be until three weeks
from now since she's going to England for two weeks to see her
friend's wedding.  Her boyfriend is in England now (Ayana has a
boyfriend?) so that makes it mo betta for her.</p>

<p>She taught me several forms today.  Te form, ta form, tai form,
something else form maybe.</p>
