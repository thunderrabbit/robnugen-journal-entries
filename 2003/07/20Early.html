the hallway and write some Japanese sentences and study vocabulary.</p>

<br>oops... had trouble sending the first comment, this may be a semi-repeat.  The comment got wiped out, don't know if it got sent.  it was something like this:<br>
<br>
Hey Rob,<br>
<br>
Thanks for allowing me to read about your life.  I always did have a soft spot in my heart for you.  I'm into September 2000, still in suspense.  I also found the BBS thingie.  I ran across a thread about the reasons you are in Japan... I skipped the entire thing!  I wanna hear it here first.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if you may have taken my original comment to you (ass kicking) wrong.  I had just read a journal entry from 92 or 93 where you had written something like "time to visit the Castle and kick Scout Seven's butt."  Believe me, the comment was written with fondness and nostalgia for those times.  Through the years, I have often reminisced about the magic we created there.<br>
<br>
For the past few months, I've been toying building my own site, and you have inspired me to go through with it.  I'll have a log for my thoughts from each day, and other fun adventure kind of stuff.<br>
<br>
Good night TR,<br>

<br>Don't worry about my real name being in the journal.  That entry brought back good memories... hence the "Dood."
