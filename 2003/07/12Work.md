<p class=date>5:55pm JST Saturday 12 July 2003</p>

<p>Work today wasn't the worst Saturday ever.   I almost had the best
class ever when none of FOUR students showed up for 10 minutes.  I
thought I was in no-show-heaven until one arrived.  So I was like cool
no problem; I like man to mans, but then another came, so I was like
sigh but I can just have them talk to each other, and then another
came so I had three students, which is generally the least favorable
number.</p>

<p>Oh god in one kid's class I was just fucking falling asleep so
hardcore; it was practically tragic.  Wow.</p>

<p>I'm reminded of this cause I'm falling asleep now on the train.  I
can't keep my train of thought.  Cecile didn't see me when she got on
the train.  She trained at Kawasaki with her main man Matthew.</p>
