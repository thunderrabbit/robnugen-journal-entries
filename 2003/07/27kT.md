<p>Called kT tonight!  She's kickin' it at a law firm up in New
England, which she's doing because she remembered the people there (at
the law firm) were nice, but now she's remembering the people there
(in Brooklyn) are not nice in general, so she has no friends.</p>

<p>Other than that, and the shooting at City Hall, everything is
fine.</p>

<br>Yo, my friend Nancy from Houston just moved up to Brooklyn in January with her husband (they got married in January). She doesn't have any woman type friends up there either (plz don't tell her I told you so) so maybe she can hook up with your friend (kim?). Her e-mail address is nancy_mostafa@yahoo.com. She is my best friend from 7th grade.<br>
