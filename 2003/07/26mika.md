<p class=date>9:59pm JST Saturday 26 July 2003</p>

<p>Hung out with Mika tonight for the first time.  Was a little
nervous at first, but everything seemed just right.   I have a
girlfriend; she has a boyfriend; she wants me to correct her English;
she likes to travel and has been around England, Ireland, Paris; etc
etc blah blah blah and it was nice.</p>

<p>Turns out she hangs out with Carla too on occasion.  I wonder if
that started before it was against the rules for students and teachers
to chill.</p>

<p>She taught me a little bit of Japanese and such.  Turns out we
missed the biggest fireworks festival of the *year* to hang out
tonight, but that's cool; it couldn't have happened any other way.  I
wasn't aware of the fest when we planned our meeting, and I was hungry
at the moment we were to meet so we munched and got to hang out
instead of having our first experience together be mushed silently
onto a train and withstanding the stress of the largest crowd in the
planet, etc etc.  Plus we would have barely had time to get there
before it started, not including the fact that there's no <em>way</em>
we could have gotten good seats unless we camped out there at least
all day.</p>

<p>ANYway, we had fun and will likely hang out again in the near
future to go scope a different pyrotechnic display.</p>

<p>Oh.  And her birthday?  March 25.</p>
