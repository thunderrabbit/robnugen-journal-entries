<p>Haha</p>

<p>Olivia just got caught buying a Child (elementary age) train
ticket.  The cat was all, "sumasen!" trying to get her attention and I
thought it was some panhandler, which is amazing cause Tokyo just
doesn't have such.   But he was dressed rather well and then the
(noun): "Child ticket."</p>

<p>"Oh, student ticket," explained Olivia, who didn't feign surprise,
but acted as if he had simply mistaken her for someone who should pay
full fare.</p>

<p>No shame.  No guilt.</p>

<p>"A girl's gotta save a dime in this country."</p>
