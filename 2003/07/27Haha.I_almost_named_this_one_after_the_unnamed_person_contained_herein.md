<p>Woo  (that's not "woo" like wow, but "woo" like yikes!)</p>

<p>I just saw someone who reminded me of _____ (thanks, JP), and I had the
following transaction in my head:</p>

<p>erruu? (thanks, Scooby).  couldn't have been her.  what happened?.
we hung out banging eachother for a while and I told her I loved her
and she took that to mean more than I did. jeezus.  language.  words
words words.  Words mean nothing.  Everyone has a different language
in their mind.  broughten.  earthquaked.  love.  Actions are where
it's at.  It takes me years to know someone.  Fuck language.  Release.
namaste.  I hope everything goes well for you.  I won't contact you
again, including not paying you mo money.  Release. namaste, YRUU.  I
have my set of relationships from that time.  Not going back.</p>
