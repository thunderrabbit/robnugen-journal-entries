<p>Had a good lesson with Aki.  Will go see Pirates of the Carribean
with her on August 6th.  I'll go buy tickets at Cinecitta in
Kawasaki.</p>

<p>I helped her develop this long sentence:</p>

<p>Kawasaki Cinecitta and Yokohama Movru are close to Tsunashima, but
Cinecitta is bigger than Movru, and you can buy tickets at Kawasaki,
so let's go to Kawasaki.</p>

<p>Now.   I'm going to study Japanese.</p>
