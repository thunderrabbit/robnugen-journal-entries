<p>I feel much better after talking to janette for nearly 2 hours.
First 20 minutes converted me from sad sad sleeping it all away mood
to genki enough to get up and call her from the freephone.</p>

<p>Talked a ton and I cried a lot about how hard it is to learn
Japanese and how I'm afraid I won't be able to do it, and I don't want
to come back and not have learned Japanese cause I would call that
failure and I don't know why I seem to have chosen a life without
physical connections with anyone, etc etc cry cry cry.</p>

<p>But then I felt better enough to read my Japanese sentences to her,
including these:</p>

<p>火曜に三島で僕のとまだちのりえさんと会いました。</p>

<p>じでんしゃで綱島からきくなまで行きました。</p>

<p>でんsひゃできくなからしんよこはままで行きました。</p>

<p>しんよこはまでたききっぷをかいました。</p>

<p>僕はりえさんとおとおさんとおかあさんと会いました。</p>

<p>僕はきんちょうしました。</p>

<p>日本ごをはなしませんでした。</p>

<p>her dad drove us around</p>

<p>僕はたのしかったです。</p>

<p>日本ごをはなしました。</p>

<p>finish</p>

accepting the risk of sounding too placating, i think you are doing beautifully, probably alot better than you realize.  you are staying steady on,allowing for occassional blocks.  you have not used old escape routes. it's ok to ride through soggy times and not be constantly achieving. you are strong enough to feel your pain and not buckle under and give up. i hope you will be as sweet to yourself as i would. i think you are learning alot more than japanese.
