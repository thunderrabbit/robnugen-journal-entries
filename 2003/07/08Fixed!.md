<p>My computer seems to be fixed!</p>

<p>New memory card, new CD/DVD, new motherboard!</p>

<p>And it was all free.  You know why?  Cause the machine was in
warranty by 11 days. <em>eleven.</em></p>

<p>So I've basically got 11 days to play A LOT on my computer and see
if it work work works super well.</p>

<p>From now on, I plan to drop my computer less often.</p>

<p class=date>4:27pm</p>

<p>He replaced the memory first, thinking that was the whole problem.
I didn't care what had been the problem, but felt relieved to have my
computer working again.</p>

<p>I was *more* relieved when it started to fuck up again while I was
there.  Oh thank goodness.  He thought it was the LCD and said it
would take an hour to fix.  I was like, "no problem des" though I
didn't think it was the LCD.</p>

<p>Ah; I figured out how to prove it wasn't the LCD and plugged in an
auxillary monitor, which also did not receive a signal.  Fucked around
with it a bit and he said "logic board"</p>

<p>Music to my ears.</p>

<p>I felt amazingly patient while watching him systematically remove
and replace and remove and replace different things (mostly screws); I
was just happy to get the computer fixed.</p>

<p>Yay Cory for encouraging me to persevere in Japan and not ship it
back to the US for repair.  It might have ended up past the warranty
deadline had I sent it home.  Whew!!!</p>

<p>Oh, make that 90 days I have to bang around on the computer; the
shop's work is warranted for that long.  Rock on.  Even janette will
be here before the warranty runs out.</p>
