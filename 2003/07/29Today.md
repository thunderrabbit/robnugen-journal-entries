<p class=date>5:14pm JST Tuesday 29 July 2003</p>

<p>Slept the hell out of this morning.  Until like 1:40pm.</p>

<p>Fixed the <a href="/travel/costa_rica/1998/">Costa Rica pics</a>
thanks to janette and indirectly Scout Seven.</p>

<p>Now I'm considering reorganizing navigation of my site.  I'll
design it on paper first.</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>I realized I've got a few more ideas in my head than I can program
<em>well</em> on my site.  I need to yammer with a regular expression
person (read Fred) before I implement it.</p>

<p>I *did*, however, tweak my old journal script for Jon, who, for
some reason doesn't like the new journal.pl  Ah well; I felt pretty
smart after figuring that out.  Though it took a bit longer to figure
out than it should have.  Whatever that means.</p>

<p>Talked to Olivia; she came down to check her email and we yammered
a bit.</p>
