<p>I forgot how to use a fork.  Tonight while eating dinner with Shin,
I forked my front tooth really hard like "conk!" and I was like "oh
shit" cause it felt really wierd and I was worried I might have
chipped it.  But I didn't.  Shin asked the waitress for chopsticks.
This is an unexpected anti-culture shock!  How will I eat in the
US?</p>

<br>wow-that's funny (since you didn't hurt yourself)<br>
hmmmm- in 4 months you've lost the ability to do, automatically, without injury, something you've done all your life <br>
uh-oh
