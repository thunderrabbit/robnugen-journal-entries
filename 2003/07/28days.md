<p>This is my 123rd day in Japan.</p>

<p>When I realized that I *almost* started working on my days in Japan
counter, but realized that would be a tangent and would not make me
really happy today cause studying nihongo would put me closer to my
goal in Japan, so I just wrote this entry to say good job me for
pulling myself back on course.  Now let's see if I can handle the
other obstacles I seem to throw in my own path.</p>

<p>To Do:</p>

<p>*) write some vocab on my flashcards</p>

<p>#) go to Kawaski, studying that vocab on the train</p>

<p>!) get food and eat and write Japanese sentences</p>

<p>$) show the sentences to Japanese staff for correction and cheerleading</p>

<p>%) good job, Rob</p>
