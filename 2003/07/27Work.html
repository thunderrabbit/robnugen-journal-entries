<p>Work was aight today.  Not fucked up busy.  No zombie students.  No
quote of the day either.  One student was a little kid who was quite
genki, but who didn't really want to speak.  But the cat was like
four.  He seemed like any other normal playful four year old.  I was
quite happy to let him do whatever he wanted.  He sat on my lap to let
me read to him as he flipped pages and pointed to various pictures and
words and when he got bored he used my outstretched legs as a
slide.</p>

<p>I wondered how much similar attention he gets with his actual
family.</p>

<p>Man I'm tired.  naptime.</p>

I am trying to read this book, "The Field" by Lynne McTaggart, but every few paragraphs or so give me the energy (or "light" as the book would call it) to trip out on an idea. An example is that it was talking about how, in quantum physics, things seem to only exist when they are observed. (Like subatomic particles) It's like the consciousness of the observer brings the observed into being. Ok. This got me wondering if it is the *imagination* of the observer that creates "things"... for example.... Does "The Planet Jupiter" have any relationship with the person it was "discovered" ? <br>
The guy had to expect to find something right?<br>
Maybe the person who discovered cancer was a deep down cynic.<br>
