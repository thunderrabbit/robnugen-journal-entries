<p>Despite my complaints that I'm too busy and not learning Japanese,
I'm beginning a new project of researching the origins of Silent
Football.  I'm going to slam together a page on the foot motions,
possibly scoop up variants on the game from other districts.</p>

<p>Man, where is Aki?</p>

<p>She didn't show up, and I didn't call her after 15 minutes, but
whatever.  I did, however, write a draft of the foot motions for
silent football and design a structure for my sf pages.</p>
