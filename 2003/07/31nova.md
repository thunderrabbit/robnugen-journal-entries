<p>My Nova experience has been a cakewalk compared to Matty's.  He has
been continuously harassed by his bosses - for his haircut, his
posture, his method of teaching.  Recently Matty told me he's being
specifically harassed whereas a different teacher had a complaint
lodged against her, but that teacher never heard anything about
it.</p>

<p>'sreally difficult to get fired from Nova.  But Matty has been
threatened, "if you ever skip the picture speculation again, you're
fired."</p>

<p>The picture speculation I think is one of the most difficult and
stupid parts of the lesson.  Look at a picture. "What are they doing?"
"What do you think they're saying to each other?"  The students never
want to speak up; they don't have the vocab, or they believe they
might be wrong.</p>

<p>Teachers who ascend the ranks of Nova are those that are willing to
lie for Nova or to accept (or ignore?) all of Nova's lies.  Those who
are </p>

<p>Train of thought stopped when my train reached the station.
Anyway, Nova bites in many ways.</p>
