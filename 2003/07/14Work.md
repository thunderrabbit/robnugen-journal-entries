<p>Just left work; I'm on the train in Kawasaki station.  Chatted with
Sumika and a perpetual 7A student who has been stuck there for eh ver.
He asked her about leveling up and as I was sliding out the door she
basically asked if I could help her counsel him and I'm thinking sure
thing; anything for you.  And I yammered with him for a bit, basically
telling him that his grammatical structure is all over the place, and
until he cleans that up, plus uses the correct tenses for past,
present, future constructions, he'll be stuck in 7A.</p>

<p>He seemed quite good natured about it, working hard to correct
errors he was making even as I spoke with him.  Then the three of us
were talking again and he continued to work hard to correct the
sentences he was messing up.  It was almost comical, well it was cause
he wasn't all upset or anything.</p>

<p>I ushered him out since Sumika was not getting any of her end of
day work done while talking with us, though apparently she had a
Japanese responsibility to yammer with us while we were there.</p>

<p>I wanted to chat with her on the train (we're both on Nambu line)
on the way home, but for the second week my plan was foiled again.</p>

<p>It's cool though; I broke up with her tonight; turns out she's only
22.</p>
