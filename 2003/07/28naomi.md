<p>I gave Naomi my number today.  She's the crazy genki student who
cracked me up so much last time: "you're *hilarious*" I told her then
and again today.  The one who operates the elevator in Tokyo Tower.
The one who mimicked an elephant last time we chatted.  She reminds me
of Sally in her genkiness.</p>

<p>Okay.  No more giving my number out to students.</p>
