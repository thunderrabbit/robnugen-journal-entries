Cors,

Thank you for your input.   I have spent the evening reading the
techniques you gave me and I've decided I can stay in Kawasaki.

haha actually that's not true.   I will stay in Kawasaki, but I didn't
read the techniques.  (promise)

I try to live my life by chasing my dream and walking through my fears
instead of seeking the easy way out.

Therefore, I have decided two things, the second of which scares the
fuck out of me, so I know it must be a good idea.

1) I will stay in Kawasaki Nova

2) I want to have Japanese roommates.  I want to immerse myself more
in the culture.  I want to move around mid-October, so Janette can
stay with me at my old (current) apartment when she visits.

I came to Japan to learn Japanese.  If I am more immersed, I'll
certainly learn more, presumably be happier overall, and intend for
that happiness to overflow into my work.
