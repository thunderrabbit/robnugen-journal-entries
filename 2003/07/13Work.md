<p>Lessons are going okay today.  No disasters.  Some good animal
flash card house building with Tomohiro after Jon's lesson with him
after which Jon wrote "he was a sugoy $#!+ today."</p>

<p>This is the same kid who had his head on the desk for fully 30
minutes after I came into the room, during which time I ignored him
and arranged and rearranged the animal cards in several possible
manners, including the magician trick of flipping over a row of cards
on the floor like a wave.   After 30 minutes he began to acknowledge
me and I offered him cards, but asked no questions and and and then by
the end he was doing flips underneath the table and had recited all
the animal card names, etc.</p>

<p>Today with Jon, Tomohiro was yelling "Ego janai!" (no English!) at
Jon and throwing shit around.</p>

<p>Today with me, we just made animal card houses and recited the
names.  I introduced the colors, but he didn't respond to that.  Ah
well; we had fun.</p>
