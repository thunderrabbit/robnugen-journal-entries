in The New York Times titled <b>White House Sees a $455 Billion Gap in
'03 Budget</b>, written by David E. Rosenbaum.</p>

Representative Jim Nussle of Iowa, chairman of the Budget Committee
told reporters, "Tax cuts do not cause deficits. When you reduce
taxes, taxes stay in the pocket of people that earn it. We do not
have to borrow money in order to reduce taxes. You only borrow money
in Washington for spending."

<br>Dear Rob,<br>
<br>
I did not get a chance to read more of your journal today, but that's okay because I'm enjoying the suspense.  I am at the part where you asked Wende to marry you.  At first, this came as quite a shock. I have thought about you off and on through the years, and, in a way, you always represented the "care-free, no-extraneous-responsibilites, live-off-the-land" kind of guy that I dreamed was the ideal mode of travel here on this earth.  So, I was like "Woah, Dude!"<br>
<br>
I know that you are in Japan as I type, so things between April 2000 and the present are a mystery. I am looking forward to discovering how everything has played out.<br>
<br>
See you,<br>
Gary <br>
<br>
P.S. I am wondering how many frisbees you took to Japan.<br>
