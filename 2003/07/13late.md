<p class=date>4:48am JST Monday 14 July 2003</p>

<p>I'm still awake.  Actually I took a nap for a couple hours, but I
wonder how I'll feel when I need to be awake in some hours.  I've been
working on my site, and have restructured how the navigation files are
called; I found out how to send parameters to indicate which page is
calling the cgi file.  So now instead of having a bunch of separate
.pl files I have one file that reads the params.. much simpler.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>ps: it's light outside.  as in, daylight.</p>

Two other memories from that wonderful day, though somewhat vague, are a red frisbee rolling on edge, and climbing onto the roof of Miller Outdoor Theater to get Shadow Dragon's ring frisbee thing.<br>

P.S. I am up to April 2000... so I really haven't figured out what you are doing in Japan.<br>

P.S.S. Perhaps it is not you that is phucking nUtZ... could it be that the entire world is phucking NutZ and you are one of the few sane ones?  Nah.  I like it better the other way. ;)
