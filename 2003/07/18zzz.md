<p>Three things:</p>

<p>(zero) Agreed with Jon L to give a level four student level up to
level three.  She was quite happy and passed the test rather well.
The level 3 test is rather difficult, according to Steve.</p>

<p>(ichi) Had a great 7C student to close out the day.  Her name is
Kazue, and she's a computer engineer of some variety.  Part of the
reason I liked her is she remindes me of someone else, but I can't
remember who.  She was quite yammerful, not like a normal 7C, all meek
and waiting for prompts before speaking.</p>

<p>(ni) Talked with Karen, my dad's wife about 20 minutes.  I talked
to her longer than I've talked to her ever before.  I'm not sure what
that means, but it's probably a combination of missing home and not
having experienced her anger anytime recently.</p>

<p>(san) Talked a long time with janette.  All was cool until I came
out with not really wanting to know her past because some of the parts
I know sorta creep me out like she has smoked and I'm like eeee gross
and her reaction, understandably, was "hey man that's all part of me"
and she was careful to not get defensive, but it did make her a little
sad.  Sigh.</p>

<p>(shi) At the very end as we were hanging up, she goes, "I hope that
your experience there will help you know what types of things you want
to have close to you in your life," and I was just CONKED in the
emotional head with it like BAM *sadness*.  But I didn't want to
extend the conversation longer; it's 1am and I've got to be at work in
8.5 hours.</p>

<p>(5) I did 1 - 4 above instead of studying Japanese.  I trust it's
all for the best, but sometimes it's hard to see what's best.   and
sometimes I realize there is no best; there just is what is.</p>

<br>i did not mean to conk you on the head.<br>
 i don't know how we got from you telling me #10 stories to where we ended up. <br>
 i got off the phone and cried and cried.<br>
 i feel -------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
 but i am going to figure this out, damnit, until i am feeling balanced again.<br>
and i wish we were together to talk it thru or at least so you could hold me  while i cry. <br>
i can't think of anyone else with whom i want to investigate these conflicting emotions.<br>
<br>

<br>
please accept that i did not mean to hurt you with my question about finding what's essential.<br>
