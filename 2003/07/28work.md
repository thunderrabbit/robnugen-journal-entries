<p>Work overall was pretty okay today.  I had four man to man lessons,
two frees and two filled lessons.  In my last lesson I got the quote
of the day.  First, the situation: I had set up a role play where the
three students were two spies and their boss.  The first boss did
well, effectively saying, "you have to go to China and check the
status of SARS."  It was fine.  Then I had them repeat back what they
had been asked to do.  "I have to go to China, " etc.</p>

<p>Then I switched their roles and got a new boss.  He then uttered
the quote(s) of the day.  To his first spy, "you have to buy me a
cake."  To his second spy, "you have to clean my room."</p>

<p>Hilarious.</p>
