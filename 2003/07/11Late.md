<p>Going home now but my train is crazy late.  We're just fuckin
chillin in Kawasaki station.  We've been here long enough for me to
type all this on my ketai. Still here.  No one is complaining but it
just got significantly more packed on the train as a new wave of
people just got on. Man, this bites. More crowded now. Oh good there's
the sigh of relief as the doors close and we are at the first station
now. Actually now we are at the 2nd station.  Okay bye.</p>

<p>The train got even more packed at Hirama as more people squeezed
on.  It was about the most packinist train I've experienced in
Tokyo.</p>

<p>Cors saw me as we arrived at Musashi-Kosugi where pushers wearing
their crisp short sleeve shirts and captains hats with trim were
poised to push people onto the trains.</p>

<p>Turns out the train was late due to what translates to Human Body
Incident.  Someone committed suicide by leaping in front of the
train.</p>

<p>It's amazing to me that people kill themselves with this particular
technique in Japan.  Reason: the <em>family</em> of the deceased is
fined for the incident.</p>

<p>Doing some research to see if I can verify my claim that the family
is charged and I found this movie review:  eeek!</p>
