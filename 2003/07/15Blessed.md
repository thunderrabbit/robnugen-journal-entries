<p class=date>12:40pm JST Tuesday 15 July 2003</p>

<p><em>perfect</em> timing leaving the lunch place to catch my train
on time.  And I was all nervous about it at first, but *bang* I was
spot on.  (I'm picking up several idioms from Cory)</p>

<p>Today was our last class with Hososensei for three weeks.  We'll
meet her on 5 Aug, 9 Aug and then again in September.  Olivia bought
her a gift.</p>

<p>I'm putting the word out that I want Japanese roommates.</p>

<p>During class I found it apparent that I hadn't been studying.   I
also see what Cory is talking about with too much TTT Teacher Talk
Time.  I used to talk too much in my Nova classes, but I'm shifting to
a much lower percentage.  We had a fantastic class yesterday that
featured very little TTT.</p>

<p>Hososensei explains stuff instead of letting us practice it.  I
have done the same thing.</p>
