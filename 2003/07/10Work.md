<p>Work started out great with a no show, during which I rebuilt the
file folder thing for level up criteria.  Everyone was quite impressed
with its goodness.  "That's a wuk of aht," Scott assured me.  Nice.
I'm glad to do something concrete and useful.</p>

<p>Everything was fine fine fine including another no show, which
would have been a no show for Guy, but we switched so he could have a
non-man-to-man class and so I could have a man to man.  But my man to
man didn't show up.  Nice.</p>

<p>Then the second to last lesson of the evening sucked butt cause
there were 4 people in it and my brain just falls to bits, and I don't
know what to do and I hate the feeling of oh fuck I don't know what
I'm doing, blah blah blah blah.  that ranked up there with a Worst
Lesson Ever.</p>

<p>The next lesson was with two students.  Well, it was scheduled to
be with two students, but one didn't show up.  The remaining student
was really low, but really wanted to learn and I really connected with
his brain and helped him understand past tense, and by the end, he
totally got it and was totally happy and I was totally happy to have
been so helpful.   That ranked up there with the Best Lesson Ever.</p>

<p>I'm on the train now; we should leave the station in about 1
minute.</p>
