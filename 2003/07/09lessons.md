<p>I can't overtly claim to have learned lessons today, but I have
learned some things that may or may not apply anywhere else in the
fabric of life:</p>

<p>Running down wet concrete steps, while not dangerous in itself, may
indicate that a slick tile floor below has been made more slick.</p>

<p>The pain of a headache is distinct from the pain of an overt head
trauma.</p>

<p>Though I left the apartment in a rush, my angels guided me back to
my lesson with Aki, which I had completely forgotten.  I arrived 2
minutes before the scheduled time to meet.</p>

<p class=date>late</p>

<p>I have pretty much just fucked around online all day.  This
internet in the apartment gives me an opportunity to test my
won'tpower and keep studying despite the internet.  and right now to
go to sleeep!</p>
