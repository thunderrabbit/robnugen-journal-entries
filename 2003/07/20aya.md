<p>Last night I also cried about Aya leaving Kawasaki; she's been one
of the nicest staff members (and one of the prettiest) here for these
months that I've worked.  Apparently she started working here just
after I did, but it's like she's been here the entire time I've been
here.  I'm on lunch now and she was just in the teachers' room and I
confirmed that today is her final day in big K.  She made tear
gestures and I was like, <em>no really; I really did cry.</em></p>

<p>She has to work tonight and cannot join us for the firework
festival excursion down near Yokohama.</p>
