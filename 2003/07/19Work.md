<p class=date>6:23pm JST Saturday 19 July 2003</p>

<p>No awesome students nor classes today at work.  The schedule was
crammed because Jon M tupatsued (I don't think this is a Japanese
term, but we use it at Nova to mean called in sick (or hungover)) and
then it got even worse cause Benny tupatsued as well.  I had two
minutes to pull files and plan a lesson for 3 people, but it turned
out okay because Carla had already pulled the files since she knew the
lesson had to be covered.  She had even selected a lesson that they
could do.</p>

<p>Some of the worst language structure came from my two level 3
students.  These fuckers should be able to speak quite accurately, but
they could most certainly <em>not</em>.</p>
