<p>Took a nice nap after teaching Aki at Subway.  She's getting
better, I'm quite certain.  Today she blurted out quite a long
sentence with no errors.</p>

<p>En route to KQ now.  Back to work work work.</p>

<p>Um..  Oh, Shin cancelled our lesson yesterday, but that's cool
cause I had already eaten instead of waiting for him to buy dinner.
Doubly cool is that he called me after his meeting let out and said
he'd take me to the local government office thing (he said Yokohama
City Hall, which it may very well be) to help me find guest housing!
That means I will be more fully engaged in Japanese culture, meeting
some new peeps and chatting up in Japanese far more often than seems
possible with Frank and Matty.</p>
