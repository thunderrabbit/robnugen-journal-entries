<p>I like being able to teach.  I just explained to Janette the
difference between storage improvements (CD -> DVD) and language
improvements (WAV -> MP3 -> MP4)</p>

<p>Next: bits</p>

<p>Done. Explained bits and bytes and different encoding systems.  I
loved being able to loop the whole discussion back around to explain
why characters from different systems show up differently.</p>
