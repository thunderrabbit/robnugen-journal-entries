<p class=date>4:48am JST Monday 14 July 2003</p>

<p>I'm still awake.  Actually I took a nap for a couple hours, but I
wonder how I'll feel when I need to be awake in some hours.  I've been
working on my site, and have restructured how the navigation files are
called; I found out how to send parameters to indicate which page is
calling the cgi file.  So now instead of having a bunch of separate
.pl files I have one file that reads the params.. much simpler.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>ps: it's light outside.  as in, daylight.</p>
