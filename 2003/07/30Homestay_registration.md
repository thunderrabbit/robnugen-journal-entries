<p>Shin helped me apply to stay with a host family, but we got stuck
when I said I wanted to stay for 5 months (mid-October to March).</p>

<p>Or maybe it was that I said I'm a Nova instructor.  Those dumb Nova
instructors, always messing it up for the rest of us.</p>

<p>Anyway, whereas, per my understanding via Shin, previously, they
were like, "yeah you can kickit for 3 months with one fam and then 3
months with another fam," soon as I wanted 2 months and 3 months, I
was encouraged to do a homevisit, where I meet with the peeps one day
or one night.</p>

<p>Seems that some people had used the families just as cheap housing
and didn't really chat with them / share ideas, whatever.  So a
homevisit is just yammering for a day.  Less time spent overall, but
likely more chatter time.  But I wonder if the chatter would be
helpful toward learning Japanese.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  So another option is to just meet some of the cats in my
apartment slash apply for homevisits in my area and see what happens.
Hmmm.</p>
