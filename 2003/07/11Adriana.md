<p>Today at work I learned that Adriana knows <em>five</em> languages.
She's my new crush.  She grew up speaking Russian, Serbian and
English.  Then she learned Spanish and something else.  She came to
Japan intending to learn Japanese, but got sidetracked and is learning
German and Italian.</p>

<p>And I had written her off as just a loud girl who wears makeup.</p>
