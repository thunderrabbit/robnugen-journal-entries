<p>I can update now, but I'm using this wacked out Japanese keyboard
with all the keys in the wrong places.  (Not all the keys.)</p>

<p>This is the second or third time I've had a problem here, and began
to get stuck in a downward spiral about how to solve it.  In this case
I was completely focused on FIX THE COMPUTER, when really I just want
to make updates.</p>

<p>Thinking around the problem, I realized I have other solutions to
this refined problem.</p>

<p>But fuck all that; I've got Japanese to study now.  When my
computer gets fixed, I may write/transcribe stories from these past
days, including my best day so far in Japan, which was yesterday.  But
that day has thoroughly ended and I want the memories to sit gently
before I write about it.</p>

<p>Thanks to janette and Fred for their help resolving this computer
crisis.  :-)</p>
