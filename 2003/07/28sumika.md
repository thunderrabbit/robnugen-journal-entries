<p>I broke up with Sumika tonight.  She's the staff person at KQ whose
got lovely long hair and has been really pretty nice to me though
other people have said she's mean to them.  (mean?)  I broke up with
her after some flirtation got like zero response.  She's obviously not
impressed with such, so.. no more effort will be expended in that
direction.</p>

<p>For the record, the flirtation happened after Benny was all,
"Sumika, what does your name mean?"  And she told him/us, and I said,
"it means beautiful flower," and she's like "no it doesn't."</p>

<p>Okay.  Whatever.  You're fired.</p>
