<p>One of the things I love about janette is the way she views the
world.  When she had to go drive back for a forgotten something, she
viewed it as an easy opportunity to love that someone, not as a huge
chore that got in the way of her day.</p>

<p>I just chatted with janette, got to tell her about getting my
computer fixed, and hear some of her personal growth stories, and make
some plans for the future like kickin' it on a beautiful private
beach.</p>
