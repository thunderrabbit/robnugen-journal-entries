<p>Finally.  Something resembling rain.  But really it was just a
heavy sprinkle for Houston.   Lasted only 15 minutes.  Maybe a 1/4
inch of rain.</p>

<p>Ironic that it's raining well after summer is supposed to have
started.  Last week they said this week.   This week they say next
week.   Oh when oh when will it get hot?</p>

<p>As we walked out of Subway, Aki began to whimper at the oppressive
heat and humidity.  I was like, "Akisan, I *love* this weather," and
she moaned some more.  I thought for a moment.  "It's like a
comforting blanket wrapped around me, keeping me warm and happy."</p>

<p>More moaning from Aki.</p>

<p>Next Wednesday we're going to see <em>Pirates of the
Carribean</em>.  I'll buy tickets on Monday so we can have great
seats.</p>
