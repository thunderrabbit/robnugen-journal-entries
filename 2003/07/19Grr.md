<p class=date>8:46am JST Saturday 19 July 2003</p>

<p>I woke up all grr this morning cause I have to go to work.</p>

<p>Grrr.</p>

<p>But I have successfully caught a train just in time this morning,
and there's a seat for me to write, so that's better.</p>

<p>If I'm on my bike on the bridge as the train goes by on its bridge,
then if I haul butt, I can make the *next* train, which is what I did
today.  Only thing is, from the bridge, I cannot distinguish which
trains will stop at my station, and if the "next" train is an Limited
Express train, then it won't stop at my station.</p>

<p>I'm a tiny bit sweaty; I hope I don't stink too much.</p>

<p>I showered this morning but I didn't shave, as my personal little
way to break the rules.  Oooh.  What a rebel.</p>
