<p class=date>8:51pm JST Wednesday 30 July 2003</p>

<p>I rode my bike to Kikuna station (SO EXCITED THAT JANETTE IS
BRINGING MY *REAL* BIKE WHEN SHE COMES!!!) to meet Shin.</p>

<p>(I think I should have janette bring my helmet as well.  Just...
because.)</p>

<p class=date>11:12pm</p>

<p>Lesson with Shin was cool; he expressed some concern about getting
a job in the US..  I thought he was going for his job.  Hmm.</p>

<p>We ate at Jonathan's, the upscale chain place where we went for our
first lesson in Kikuna.  He asked, "do you think I can meet with you
in the US?"  I was like, "um, the US is really big..."</p>
