<p>Shin called and cancelled our meeting tonight.  That's cool with
me; I can study more.  Not that I'm 100% studying.</p>

<p>Good study catalyst: internet is down.</p>

<p>I'm going to call janette.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh, a couple hours ago I called Nami, Rie's friend who lived in
Houston for 7 years.  Part of me is like, "wow - *that's* how to learn
a language."</p>

<p>Could I live here that long?</p>

<p>Anyway, we yammered a while and we'll hang out on August 2nd after
my work.  She said she gets to speak very little English in Japan, so
this may be a mutually beneficial arrangement!</p>
