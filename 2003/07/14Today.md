<p>On the train next to a cat from Tanzania.</p>

<p>He's been in Japan for 10 years.  Is taking 2 weeks off from work
cause he broke his arm in a car accident.  Talked about how safe Japan
is compared to big T and how some Japanese are afraid of foreigners.</p>

<p>A little girl with her mom on the previous train was mimicking the
announcer's voice as we approached the station: "Hiyoshi.  Hiyoshi
des."  (Hiyoshi; this is Hiyoshi)  In her little girl voice it was
really cute.</p>

<p>Japanese is a cool language cause it doesn't waste time with little
words.</p>
