<p>I have just read one single entry about SWUUSI (KBH's; it was the
first on my Friends List).</p>

<p>Feelings mushed up.  No words..  Just 12 hours ago I *decided* I
would/could never go back.  I know I can't but I want to.  All the
games; all the stories; all the lives positively lived and positively
affected.</p>

<p>And and and all the games that I won't fully grok, plus all the
stories that I won't be able to tell.</p>

<p>Things change.  Want to preserve it; want to preserve everything
*and* move on and forge new realities.   Want you to know you y r u u
ers are the best.</p>

<p>ps: ultra proud of Josephine and Amy.</p>

<p>ps not sorted: Ants and Cheese, Silent Football, Ardmore,
Applebees, talent shows, and the rest..</p>

<p>It's 1:35.  I gotta sleep.  Not that I have to be at work in less
than 11 hours, which I don't, but..  maybe it's to wash away all these
emotions.</p>

<p>I miss you guys.</p>
