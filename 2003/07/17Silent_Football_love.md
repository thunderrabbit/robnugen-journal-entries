<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I feel blessed and loved.  I got an email from Ben, asking for my
recommendation on a new possible move in Silent Football (ironic since
Fred and I were recently discussing how neither he nor I could just
arbitrarily make new rules).. Basically defining how/if an outward
facing person can Fwap the ball.</p>

<p>And Maggie wrote me a super long email transcribing some of my
old-school journal entries (<a
href="http://www.robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?date=1993/03/20">20
March 1993</a>) and has expressed that she really misses me as
well.</p>

<p>Sigh.  So much love.  Thank you, thank you.  I miss you guys so
much.</p>
