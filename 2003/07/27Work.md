<p>Work was aight today.  Not fucked up busy.  No zombie students.  No
quote of the day either.  One student was a little kid who was quite
genki, but who didn't really want to speak.  But the cat was like
four.  He seemed like any other normal playful four year old.  I was
quite happy to let him do whatever he wanted.  He sat on my lap to let
me read to him as he flipped pages and pointed to various pictures and
words and when he got bored he used my outstretched legs as a
slide.</p>

<p>I wondered how much similar attention he gets with his actual
family.</p>

<p>Man I'm tired.  naptime.</p>
