<p class=date>12:59am JST Saturday 26 April 2003</p>

<p>Crud.  I didn't realize how late it is.</p>

<p>I've been reading/writing email, listening to iTunes (working on a playlist
for a CD I'll burn for work) and I did laundry.  Didn't study Japanese
tonight.</p>

<p>I'm kinda stuck in that mode of
oh-god-I-have-too-much-to-do-so-where-do-I-start and instead of
starting just get sidetracked.  Ah well.</p>

<p>But I gotta go to bed so I can get up and embark on a new adventure
at Nova with the correct shoes which of course I'll need cause my bike
is awol.  Sigh.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
