<p>Dammit.  I knew that cat was giving me incorrect directions.  At
the bike place, after getting my bike back, and profuse verbal thanks
given to Koko's mom, Koko asked where Tsunashima was and he pointed
all over the place except where I knew the shit to be.  I went his way
anyway and now I'm 5km from Shin-Yokohama and 1km away from Hiyoshi
and dammit if I can't find Hiyoshi on the map to get an estimate of
where I am.</p>

<p>And double dammit that I don't know where it is; cause I
should.</p>

<p>I'm debating going back the way I came to prove that I coulda
gotten home without his help,or had I ignored his help but fuck that
wouldn't prove it to anyone but me.</p>

<p>I'm worth it.  I'm going back.</p>

<p>We were both right.  I had missed a turnoff.</p>
