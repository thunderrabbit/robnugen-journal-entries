<p class=date>8:33am JST Saturday 12 April 2003</p>

<p>Wandered a bit around my city this morning, beginning to memorize a
few landmarks.</p>

<p>I intend to memorize the stations between my house and work as
well.</p>


<pre>
Tsunashimia (home)
Motosumiyoshi
Hiyoshi
Musashi-Kosugi (change to Nambu line)

Musashi-Kosugi
Mukaigawara
Hirama
Kashimada
Yako
Shitte
Kawasaki (work)
</pre>

<p>The post office in my city is closed on Saturdays and Sundays.  I
need to mail in my tax form thing.  Maybe I can find a stamp at
work.</p>

<p>Has my writing become more terse since I started teaching English?
Some other instructors have described this phenomenon happening to
them.</p>

<p>One trick the trains do is arrive on different tracks in the larger
stations, so sometimes we get off on the left and sometimes on the
right.  The smaller stations aren't so tricky.</p>

<pre>
