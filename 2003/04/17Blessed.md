<p>Oh my gosh.  So amazing.  So incredible.  I'm so blessed.</p>

<p>I met with Koko (short for Kayoko) this morning; she will be my
personal tutor on Wednesdays.  I'll teach her English and she'll teach
me Japanese.</p>

<p>I was more than willing to pay 1000 yen per lesson, but she was
like "no no no no" and asked that I pay 100 yen per lesson just to pay
for photocopying materials.</p>

<p>Her mom was there (chaperoning the first meeting?) and when Koko
asked if I had any problems with my Japanese life, I was all, "um, I
wonder how I can buy a used bike," she yammered with her mom for a
second and then ... you guessed it, "you can use our bike."</p>

<p>And I'm like, "shit, dawg, I don't want to take your family's
bike!" or something like that and they explained that they bought it
for mom to use, but it's too big and has been wasting away in the
garage; they don't even know if the tires have air.</p>

<p>WHOOHOOOOOO!!</p>

<p>So Koko is going to bring it next week.  I'll meet with her on
Wednesday at 10am, and I assume all subsequent Wednesdays until
further notice.  Yahoooo!!!!!!</p>

<p>She went through the flash cards I had made, correcting a few.  She
showed me the kanji of the various trains on the Toyoku line (my local
line (and hers too)).  Told me that the kanji for different lines may
be different (which could explain why the shit seems so confusing!)</p>
