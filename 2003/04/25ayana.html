<p>Just had my first paid Japanese lesson with あやな.</p>

<p>I found that if I release my mind, the words flow more easily.
Don't think; just speak.  "Untie your tongue," me-an-Wende's Spanish
teacher would say.</p>

<p>A couple of times I untied my tongue; just letting the words flow
like a heartbeat. (*)</p>

<p>I learned shit like これ, それ, あれ, どれ are used to mean generic
this, that, and that (various distances away from the speaker) and
この, その, あの, どの are used when specifying a noun "this dog" "that
dog" この　いぬ or その　いぬ.   I'm still not really certain about the uses
of どれ and どの, though.</p>

<p>Also learned some numeric stuff like hundred, thousand, ten
thousand: ひゃく, せn, まn.</p>

<p>And more more more.</p>

<p>(*) silly Vanilla Ice thinks harpoons flow.</p>

<p>There was one more thing... um......................  Oh, I think
I'll create a pronounciation guide on my site somewhere.</p>
