<p>I seem to have more thoroughly lost my phone than the last time I
thought I lost it.  I remember using it to call Janette this morning I
think.  And I've only been to Tsunashima since then.  I wonder if I
left it at one of the shops..  I remember my phone's string handle
thing recently got stuck on my keys when I was digging out some
change.  Was that just a bit ago at Lawson's?  Or was it earlier at
the food store?  Hmmmmmm.</p>

<p>I can walk to Lawson's now, but I think the food store is closed
for the evening.</p>

<p>Ah well.  I'll get it back; it couldn't be far.</p>

<p>What makes me most anxious about having misplaced my phone is the
idea that Janette might call to chat and I'll miss the call.</p>

<p class=date>9:51pm</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm a bit stuck on this.  Sigh.  Release.  release
release.</p>

<p>My phone had turned into my umbilical cord to Dallas.  Fuckin' A,
man; let it go.</p>
