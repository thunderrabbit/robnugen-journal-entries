<p>Just had my first paid Japanese lesson with Ç†Ç‚Ç».</p>

<p>I found that if I release my mind, the words flow more easily.
Don't think; just speak.  "Untie your tongue," me-an-Wende's Spanish
teacher would say.</p>

<p>A couple of times I untied my tongue; just letting the words flow
like a heartbeat. (*)</p>

<p>I learned shit like Ç±ÇÍ, ÇªÇÍ, Ç†ÇÍ, Ç«ÇÍ are used to mean generic
this, that, and that (various distances away from the speaker) and
Ç±ÇÃ, ÇªÇÃ, Ç†ÇÃ, Ç«ÇÃ are used when specifying a noun "this dog" "that
dog" Ç±ÇÃÅ@Ç¢Ç  or ÇªÇÃÅ@Ç¢Ç .   I'm still not really certain about the uses
of Ç«ÇÍ and Ç«ÇÃ, though.</p>

<p>Also learned some numeric stuff like hundred, thousand, ten
thousand: Ç–Ç·Ç≠, Çπn, Ç‹n.</p>

<p>And more more more.</p>

<p>(*) silly Vanilla Ice thinks harpoons flow.</p>

<p>There was one more thing... um......................  Oh, I think
I'll create a pronounciation guide on my site somewhere.</p>
