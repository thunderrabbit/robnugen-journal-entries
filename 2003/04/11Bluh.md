<p class=note>(my chopsticks pulled apart perfectly)</p>

<p>On the way home from work I rode with Olivia on the trains.  Olivia
recently purchased a new bicycle and really promoted having a bike.
She loves it.</p>

<p>As she sped away on her bike I was left with myself.  No bike.  Why
don't I have a bike?  Is it better to send my bike over here from
Dallas or to get one here?  Why don't I just go get one?  (money) Why
don't I just go jump online for a sec and upload my entries? (Money)
Why don't I just get internet access at the apartment? (don't know how
much MONEY it will cost) Grr grr grr grr</p>

<p>Why am I so stuck on money?</p>

<p>Partially I'm money-blind right now.  I don't seem to know how much
is in my account at home; I don't know how much is in my account
here.  I don't know how my money here will get home and how many US $
my yen will become.  Am I wealthy here?  Am I going to be able to pay
off my debt in a year, save up enough $ to travel to Singapore when
I'm done, romp around Europe after that, pay for private Japanese
language tutoring, eat at the sushi train, drink a liter of orange
juice every night, get internet access here at the crib?</p>

<p>Go see Eminem?</p>

<p>Buy more memory for my computer?</p>

<p>What are my priorities?</p>

<p>Why did I originally come to Japan?  (It all started when I decided
I want to be paid to lead youth group tours around the world.  I
called a company and they asked if I had in-country experience.  I
didn't have it.  I decided to live in Japan for a year so that I could
call them back and say "yeah, I've lived in Japan for a year, and I
know Japanese; I know the culture.")</p>

<p>So that makes me think learning Japanese oughta be a priority for
me.</p>

<pre>
Priorities:
learn Japanese
</pre>

<p>Why am I working in Japan?  To pay off the debt I've accumulated
while driving around the country.  So that makes working slash making
money slash winning in pachinko parlors a priority</p>

<pre>
Priorities:
learn Japanese
make some bling bling
</pre>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I talked to Janette and felt much better after that.  It seems that
I'm money-blind right now; I don't know what resources I have
available.  I don't seem to be Zen enough to just say meh; I still
want to pay off my debt, and I still want to see Eminem.  And
Japan.</p>

<br>a.) money is the devil, though necessary and required for life and whatnot....HOWEVER, you know that you are not broke. I say you combine your priorities to learn japan and see eminem.  You may go to the concert if you teach yourself how to say "Excuse me sir, I'd like to purchase one ticket to Eminem. How many yen will that cost? I'd like to sit in the __th row. Thank you." SEEEEEEE?!!? PROBLEM SOLVED!!!! hot damn i'm a genius. <br>
