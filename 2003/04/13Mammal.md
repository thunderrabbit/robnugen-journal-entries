<p>Am I a mammal?  Today I've just been attached to my bed.  Each time
I try to get up I'm like brrrrr it's tooo cold.  Even though it's not
really *that* cold.  Like giant bed magnets keep me stuck.</p>

<p>My fingers are almost too paralyzed to write.  My brain goes
flitting about in different directions wondering about this and
thinking about that, all under the guise of optimizing my experience
here in Japan, but ultimately resulting in further hibernation.</p>

<p>Okay I'm *really* going to study some Japanese now.</p>

<p class=date>9:55am</p>

<p>I studied the katakana: A, I, U, E, O, Ka, Ki, Ku, Ke, & Ko.  I can
now write and identify each of these.</p>

<p>Plus I took a shower and started my laundry.</p>
