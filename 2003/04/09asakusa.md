<p>Dru writes well.</p>

<p>More like a narrator than just I did this and I did that.</p>

<p>Soaking in the sights at Asakusa, a temple close to downtown Japan.
I might say "this is the Japan I came to see" for it's the most
traditional-Japanese-lookin' thing I've seen so far... except for two
things:</p>

<p>(!) I didn't come to see a particular part of Japan.</p>

<p>(@) We're still in Tokyo.  10 or 12 story buildings overlook the
temple on all sides, with just enough space granted the temple for me
to imagine what it might have looked like 100 years ago.</p>

<p>I witnessed without real understanding people praying at a cauldron
full of sand where they stick lighted bundles of incense.  A large pit
receives probably 1000 yen per minute as people toss in coins and take
a moment to pray.</p>

<p>We took part in one ceremonial fortune-telling that had an English
translation.  100 yen in the slot, shake a shaker of sticks until one
stick comes out, match the kanji to a drawer, pull out the fortune.</p>

<p><em>Both</em> of us got "BAD FORTUNE" with specifics ranging from
"Your mind is unsetttled wondering to leave or to stay." to "Stop
marriage of any kind and new employment."</p>

<p>Verrry interesting.  I flipped a coin three times and 2 out of 3 it
said don't sweat it.  Cool.</p>
