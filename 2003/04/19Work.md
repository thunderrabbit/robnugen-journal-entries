<p class=date>6:05pm JST Saturday 19 April 2003</p>

<p>Good stuff at work:</p>

<p>!) My day started out busy and then tapered off at the end.</p>

<p>@) A couple of lessons were really funny slash really great for
other reasons.</p>

<p>#) The best lesson was one that started out badly (not in a bad bad
way, but I couldn't find a folder and when I told the student I
couldn't find the folder, he assumed I meant he was in the wrong
room)</p>

<p>$) Steve wasn't there (always true on Saturdays)</p>

<p>%) One more thing that I don't remember.</p>

<p>^) A full 170 degree rainbow greeted me as I left the building.</p>

<p>&) I got a seat on the train on the way home.</p>

<p>Bad stuff at work:</p>

<p>.)</p>

<p class=date>8:55pm</p>

<p>I remembered what I had forgotten for number % above.  In the
teachers' lounge we often play music and the music is often hip hop.</p>
