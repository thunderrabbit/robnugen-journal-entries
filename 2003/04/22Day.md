<p class=date>8:11am JST Wednesday 23 April 2003</p>

<p>Yesterday:</p>

<p>Dru and I went to Ginza, where I don't remember what we saw.</p>

<p>Then to Akihabara, the electric/electronic megopolis of Tokyo!
Coolest thing there: refrigerators with hinges on both sides of the
door so they can be opened either way!</p>

<p>We looked for an electronic dictionary for me, a Canon Wordtank
IDF-3000.  I only mention the model because I've heard from two
separate people that they are flat the best.</p>

<p>All the different stores seemed to have the price pegged at 9980
yen, but then I found it for 9500 yen and bought it there.  9975
including tax, so I paid with a single 10,000 yen note.  Nice.</p>

<p>Dru helped me look for Genki I, a book suggested to me by Ayana.
The bookstore we visited didn't seem to have it.  On the way home I
looked at another bookstore and they didn't have it.</p>

<p>Also on the way home, I rode a crowded train.  It wasn't so bad
though; I could still breathe without effort. (*)</p>

<p>I chatted with Janette on the phone and we simultaneously
dropped/spilled something while 6000 miles apart.</p>

<p>(*) Back some years ago in like 1996 or so I went to a NIN concert
and was right up next to the stage.  The crowd behind me pushed so
hard that I found it difficult to take full breaths.  Nice.</p>
