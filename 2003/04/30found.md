<p>Frank is a genius.</p>

<p>He actually <em>looked at a map</em> other than the
not-exactly-to-scale train map and noted that Kawasaki is not too far
away.  Tonight, the night I got my bike back, I rode my bike to
Kawasaki with only a river as my guide and made it to my work in 1
hour.  Once there, I stopped by the cop box to see if I could park my
bike in the area.  I could.  They gave me vague directions to get back
to Tsunashima and said it would take me an hour to ride there.</p>

<p>I got back in 45 minutes.</p>

<p>That's how long it takes to walk and ride the train to work.  If I
ride my bike, I can keep the reimbursement I get for my train pass
each month.  That's 15,000 yen, equivalent to five shifts of
overtime.</p>

<p>Plus, if I ride my bike to work, I'll be staying in shape.</p>

<p>I'm tie-erd.  Good night.  Actually I gotta shower first cause I
stink like ew.</p>
