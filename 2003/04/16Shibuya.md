<p>Shibuya is the station at the Tokyo end of my train line.  It's the
one with four tracks all beginning/ending in one room.  The trains
come in, everyone gets off on one side and everyone else gets boards
on the other.</p>

<p>Trains all start here, but they visit different stations down the
line.  Local trains hit all the stations.  Express trains hit fewer
stations.  Limited Express trains hit even fewer.  I don't know how
Commuter Express trains compare to the others.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that I can take an Express but not a Limited
Express and get to my station.  I'm on an express now.  I waited for
the previous (Local) train to leave so I'd be first in line to get on
this train (at the door very back door of the train, deepest into the
station, closest to the End Of The Line).</p>

<p>People are crowded standing in front of me but they're not
<em>packed</em>.  Basically everyone has 4 inches of space between
them.</p>
