<p>Being silly has its benefits and some apparent drawbacks.</p>

<p>I have just arrived at the International Lounge where I can get
inexpensive Japanese classes (100 yen for 2 hours = ridiculously
cheap) and classes have just ended for the day and won't happen again
until <em>Thursday</em>.</p>

<p>Now.  I <em>had</em> this information; it was given to me and
Olivia at the Ward Office on the same day.  The day we signed up for
our alien registration.</p>

<p><em>Olivia</em> (and some girl-friend of hers (who sounded like a
Kiwi)) came to the class.  I missed it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>However, it does appear that I'm doing this "Japan thing" on my own
more than she.  That's apparently a choice; I could hang out with my
roommates more, but they don't seem interested in taking Japanese
classes.  I could meet other cats, but I've not done that so far.
I've found my little internet cafe and have plugged in for my fix.
But the fix is no longer free, and I hear Japan calling me while I'm
there.</p>

<p>Olivia had a friend with her who's fluent in Japanese and English
at the Ward office.  I imagine this bridge to the Japanese world has
made it a bit easier for her to become integrated and feel settled
enough to .. for example, pay attention to the flyer and plan ahead
and come to class instead of play online.</p>

<p>The d'ohest part of this: I have Tuesdays and Wednesdays off.  I
just missed the one class that's held during my two days off.
But.... I can come on Thursday & Friday and then zip off to work when
I'm done.</p>
