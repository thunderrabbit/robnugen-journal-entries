<p class=date>8:48am JST Tuesday 29 April 2003</p>

<p>I walked to the train/bus station that I normally used but took the
bus instead of the train, as suggested on the sheet to get my bike.
Showed the driver the name of the bus stop I wanted to visit and he
was all, "ÅÕÇ¢" (yes) and I'm like, "Å†ÇËÇ™Ç∆" (thanks, chief) and then
we go on our merry way.</p>

<p>Fortunately, before we reached my bus stop, I noticed I had showed
him the name of the <em>destination</em> for this bus. Not my stop.
Double fortunately, by that time I had done enough pattern matching to
know what I was looking / listening for to identify my stop.  Just in
time, I found it.</p>

<p>Got off the bus and was like "?????" cause I had no idea which way
to walk, etc to find my bike.</p>

<p>Showed a cat the map I had and he went inside and produced another
map with my path highlighted on it.  Thank god for the Japanese
helpful society.</p>

<p>Walked to the destination and as I think I should be there by now I
see it.  Hundreds of sad bikes, locked away in the Bike Pound.  The pound was only
identifiable by me by all the bikes and all the barbed wire on top of
a strong fence.</p>

<p>Looked at the gate.  Locked.  *Now* I know what the "yammeryammer
11 yammeryam 7 yammer yammyam" meant on the piece of paper.  11 to 7 is when they are open.</p>

<p>Excellent.  I'll just settle down and practice Japanese for an
hour.  I knew I'd need a comfortable place to sit, so I began to
explore the area a bit, walking up a ramp to the crosswalk over the
street and got a higher perspective of the view of bikes.</p>

<p>Make that <em>thousands</em> of bikes filling this 2 acre pen.
They are all lined up carefully, but otherwise unprotected from the
elements.</p>

<p>And then I noticed something.  Not out there but right here on me.
Not a bug nor a snake, but something disgustingly <em>missing</em>.</p>

<p>My wallet.</p>

<p>How the holy <em>fuck</em> did I not bring my wallet?  Am I an <em>idiot</em>???  Don't I realize that I need *money* to recover my bike?</p>

<p>I cried.  I sighed.  I called Frank at home.  My wallet is not on my desk.</p>

<p>Fortunately I have enough change to take the bus back home.  I
think I'll look for an ATM and crack into my account for the first
time since I've been here.  I've not been paid yet, but they gave me
(and anyone else who requested it (and who wouldn't??))  an interest
free loan that will be taken out of my next three paychecks.   I had
hoped to leave it and its pretty zeros unblemished in my account.
Like a perfect crystal sphere, the wholeness of which *proves* that I
can live in Japan on my own.  No loans, no coddling.  Proof.</p>

<p>Well now I'm about to prove I can change my mind, find an ATM, and
shatter some fuckin' crystal.</p>

<p class=date>9:07am</p>

<p>Shit.   That was a perfect ending to a cool entry.  I'll shatter it:</p>

<p>I have to have my <em>wallet</em> before I can get the bike because my ID *and* my proof that the bike has been loaned to me is in there.  Back
to the bus I go.</p>

<p>(note: I do not have to have my wallet to get money; I can use my passbook to get cash from the ATMs.)</p>
