<p>Work has gone quite well today.  I've had three lessons so far and
am now on lunch.  My third lesson was a 7C with two students.  7C is
the lowest level and could mean they know no English at all.  At the
beginning of the lesson I was a tad worried, but by the end, I had
them simulating a customer purchasing something from a store clerk,
and the store clerk making change for the price.</p>

<p>And I'm talking *basic* stuff.</p>

<p>I would say, "okay, bananas and apples."</p>

<p>A: "Bananas and apples please."</p>

<p>B: mime giving the item</p>

<p>A: "How much?"</p>

<p>B: "one dollar"</p>

<p>A: give the play money</p>

<p>B: give play money change</p>

<p>I wonder how much of this shit they retain.</p>
