<p class=date>8:22am JST Thursday 17 April 2003</p>

<p>Am I tired?  Or is this what Annie was telling me about: an excuse
my body is trying to create to keep me from embracing the world around
me?</p>

<p>Today at 10am, I'm meeting a woman named Koyuko (I think) who
learned that I want to take private Japanese lessons.  I'll get up now
and zip over to the International Lounge and practice / write flash
cards before we meet.</p>
