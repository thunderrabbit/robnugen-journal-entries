<p class=date>6:59am JST Friday 25 April 2003</p>

<p>I practiced my flashcards.  Rode my bike to the post office and
mailed Å›Å‚Ç¨ to Janette.  Got a free lesson at work during which time I
colored kids' flash cards.  My first four cards were beautiful, with
shading and creativity.  My next eight cards were not as carefully
colored.</p>

<p>Rode my bike home zzzzzoooooooooommmm!!!</p>

<p>Studied japanese and then yammered with Janette until I fell
asleep.</p>
