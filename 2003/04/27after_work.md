<p>"Yeah I can; I just fuckin' did!"</p>

<p>That's what I said when Steve was all, "now, you can't start
drinking until everyone has a drink!" after I chugged most of my
orange juice when it arrived.</p>

<p>:-P</p>

<p>There.  I got to snap back at Steve a bit cause we're not at work
hahahahahaaha</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>fast:</p>

<p>Amazing stories from Benny who is all like telling some fucked up
stories about chasing people down who stole plastic pitchers but not
really caring about the pitchers, just the chase.</p>

<p class=date>11:47pm</p>

<p>What a totally great night!</p>

<p>I'm just now on the train in Ç©ÇÌÇ≥Ç´.</p>

<p>Oh oh oh so much fun.  I basically stayed in place at the table
where I originally sat by Bill and chugged orange juice.  Most other
people played musical chairs without any music, except for Phil who
happened to be sitting across from me.  He and I didn't talk a whole
lot though.</p>

<p>I greatly enjoyed learning / showing off my limitedÅ@Ç…ÇŸÇÒÇ≤ prowess to some of the
Ç…ÇŸÇÒÇ∂ÇÒ staff from Nova.
Started with ÇΩÇ◊Ç‹Ç∑ then expanded to
ÇΩÇ◊ÇΩ and from across the table
Ç∑Ç›Ç© saw me and was all, "hey Robsan not so
fast; you can relax a little!" cause she apparently thought the pages
and pages in my notebook had been filled tonight or something.</p>

<p>Ç‰Ç´ couldn't answer all the questions I asked, like how to explain
radicals (which I understand to be portions of kanji) nor something
about how my electronic dictionary explained kanji.  whatever</p>

<p>She confirmed for me something I guessed/knew about kanji - that
once I know some kanji, other kanji will be easier to learn because
their meanings are based on their component kanji.  Like compound
words such as rainbow.</p>

<p>And she helped me understand something about verb conjugation and
gave me a past tense form (add ta to the end)</p>

<p class=date>12:00am</p>

<p>(train has just now started moving; I hope I make it to
ÇﬁÇ≥ÇµÇ±Ç∑Ç¨ before the train line to my house goes
to sleep for the night.)</p>

<p>Ummmmmmmmmmmmmm oh I learned all the names of the Japanese staff:Ç‰Ç´, Ç‹Ç≥Ç–ÇÎ, Ç∆Ç‡Ç±, Ç†Ç‚, Ç∑Ç›Ç©, Ç≠Ç›Ç±, and I hope no others cause
that's all I can barely remember.</p>

<p>For some reason this train seems to be going more slowly than the
trains during rush hour.  Like between the stations it doesn't reach
as high of a speed as the trains I usually ride.</p>

<p>Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
. . . . .</p>

<p>I dunno.</p>

<p>Oh!  Benny and Carla are two Canadians with a rivalry of sorts
cause Benny likes sports teams from Canada and dramatically denies
Carla's Canadian Blood since she likes teams in the US teams in the
hockey, baseball, and basketball.  Of course, I'm like "dude whatever
who cares" but he obviously has fun caring.</p>

<p>On the way home I met Jonathon (sp) who has just signed his second
year contract with Nova.  We yammered a bit about Niagra Falls since
he lived near there and I was all, "oh, you know that wall on the
Canadian side that sticks out past the falls?"</p>

<p>"yeah..."</p>

<p>"I want to sit on that wall."</p>

<p>He nodded. ..  "it could be done."</p>

<p>Nice.</p>
