<p>Killa.  Finished OJT today and today went much better than
yesterday.  I think I can do this.  Steve is still too jolly for my
own good, and makes fucked up jokes, sometimes meaning to be joking,
but it came across badly a couple times..  Whatever.</p>

<p>My first lesson's timing went flawlessly; I kept to the clock so
well; Steve was my observer so that was convenient.</p>

<p>The ohter lessons varied in how well they stuck to the NOVA
timekeeping schedule, but all went well.</p>

<p>Benny knows a cat from Canda (he's (Benny is) from Canada) who is
DJing tonight, so we're going there.</p>

<p>Get this:  I'm going <em>out</em> to a <em>club</em> in
<em>Japan</em>.... wearing shoes, pants, shirt, and a TIE!</p>
