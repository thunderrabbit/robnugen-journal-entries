<p>I took some fun photos today.  Each of us spotted different things,
Andrew with his artistic eye, Ben with his belief that he doesn't take
many pictures, me with my digital camera that turns off by itself
snapping many photos of random stuff cause bits are cheap.</p>

<p>Funny that I went up to the bicycle-taxi rider in broken English
"We photo on taxi?" and he's all "yeah sure."</p>

<p>"Haha!  He speaks English" I announced back to A & B.  I posed in
the driver's seat with them in the back.</p>

<p>The neighborhood around Harajuku has awesome shops and architecture
and the cool shrine at which we started.  Definitely worth a
visit.</p>
