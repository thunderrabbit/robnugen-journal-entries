<p>Earlier I called ‚±‚± but did not leave a voice mail.  She just now
called me back and I explained that her mom's bike got towed and I
lost my wallet and therefore couldn't pick it up.  Fun thing is that
somehow I pressed a button on my phone so that the conversation was recorded; I
could transcribe it if I wanted.  The only reason to transcribe it though
would be to capture her reaction when I told her "when I went to get
the bike, I lost my wallet."</p>

<p>It was a laugh that simultaneously said "oh jeez what else could go
wrong?" and "I feel your pain" and "it will be all good."</p>

<p>She said she will help me get it tomorrow.</p>

<p>I wonder how I can repay the favor.</p>

<p>I really really really hope I can get cash (and a new chain
wallet?) before I see her tomorrow.</p>

<p>Time to study.</p>
