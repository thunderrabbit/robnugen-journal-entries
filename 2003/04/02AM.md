<p class=date>8:35am JST Wednesday 2 April 2003</p>

<p>I'm thankful to have not required using an alarm in the morning.
I've finished my homework (second day of OJT); now I'm going in search
of a post office to snail to Colleen and snail a postage paid thing to
get the hookup on my calling card.  This will let me recharge it at
Lawson's and give me 5 minutes of free calling.</p>
