<p class=dream>My dad was at church leading the newcomers meeting,
describing what it would mean for them to commit to the church.  He
was winging his speech and I could tell he was nervous.  Afterward, he
was talking to people and I was nearby, but didn't turn around when he
exchanged nice-to-meet-yous with a couple of guys.  I didn't want to
meet them cause they were saying some bullshit about how great his
speech was and it really wasn't.  I was just going to say "man you
were really nervous and it showed" but I didn't want him to lose face
in front of his new friends or for them to lose face in front of
him.</p>

<p>am I turning Japanese?  (in Japan it's socially important to not
make anyone embarassed)</p>
