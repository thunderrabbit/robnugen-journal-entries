<p>Often, my students in Nova don't know the word "instead," and I
have not yet worked out a quick way to explain it.  But here are some
examples of its use:</p>

<p>Instead of having my wallet, the police did not have my wallet.</p>

<p>Instead of being open, the bank was closed.</p>

<p>Instead of buying a chain wallet, I did not buy a chain wallet
because instead of having any money, I have no money.</p>

<p>My money locked away in the bank instead of in my hand.</p>

<p>Instead of restraining my emotions as I understand the Japanese do
to prove their integrity of character, I yelled "fuck fuckin' fuck
fuck!" at almost the top of my lungs while outside beside loud traffic
and wind that drowned out my voice.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Now I'm at the International Lounge waiting for Koko.  I really
hoped to do some of this myself.  I shoulda asked Matty or Frank for
some cash, but I turned it down, assuming the bank would be open
today.</p>

<br>to explanin instead....<br>
its ins generally easier to say what you did do first instead of what you didnt.<br>
<br>
it makes more sense in the middle of a sentence instead of at the beginning.<br>
<br>
i dont understand EXACTLY how you teach them but .... give them an orange or something and say  "here, w ould  you like an orange?  or instead, would you like this moldy bananna?"  or whatever else you have on hand....  you should do it that way first bec. its easier to understand compare/contrast issues that way..<br>
<br>
and i dont recomend yelling fuck at them :)<br>
<br>
and i HAD an easter card for you...but forgot to send it... so i bought a new one..and perhaps it might get sent this time :)<br>
