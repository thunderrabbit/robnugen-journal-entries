<p>Oh gosh.</p>

<p>I *thought* I had finished my liter of OJ.  I grabbed the carton,
but it was heavier than I thought (i.e. not empty) and I almost
dropped it.... but I caught it before glushing its precious contents
onto the floor, which woulda really soured my mood (and carpet (pun
intended)).  I'm thankful that I caught it.  So thankful that I
finished the carton.</p>
