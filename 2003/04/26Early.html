<p>For some reason I seem to be up early.  Last night I told myself to
get up the first time I woke up because I knew I couldn't finish two
full sleep cycles before I had to get ready for work and I chose to
experience a gentle transition from sleepin' to awake instead of
shattered out of bed by my alarm.</p>

<p>Then I asked for the blessing of waking up at the exact right
moment.  Here I am, groggy but awake.</p>

<br>Hey to the Rob man, <br>
 I just wanted to take a brief moment to tell you that I met your Mother this past weekend at Spring Con at All
Souls Tulsa. What a delightful person. We talked quite a bit and I
must say that I was completely taken by her. I can see that you and Fred come by your wonderful ways naturally. Just
to repeat myself, what a delightful person. Hope everything continues well in Japan,
hope you havent lost your phone again, hope you havnt lost any of your innocents, I think I
lost mine but it was pretty small to begin with.
Good luck with your great adventure. Love,Bill(thats really bhyllx)
