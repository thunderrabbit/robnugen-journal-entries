<p class=date>10:53pm JST Monday 14 April 2003</p>

<p>Got home from work and my phone was magically on my desk on top of
a postcard from Janette!</p>

<p>I plan to get a longer string/handle thing for my phone, maybe a
retractable one that keeps it attached to me.  That might be a bit
obnoxious or look stupid, but I'm certainly thankful to have my phone
back.</p>

<p>Life is beautiful.</p>

<p>And I have the next two days off work.  Nice.</p>
