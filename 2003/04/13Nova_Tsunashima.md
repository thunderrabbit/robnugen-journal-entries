<p>The Nova office in Tsunashima is SO relaxed compared to Kawasaki!
They've got maybe four lessons max going on at once instead of at
least four plus kids classes in Kawasaki.  Man this is fantastic and I
love covering for people here!</p>

<p>Because it's so relaxed, and in my area, I have learned where my
local bank is located so I can begin the process of discerning my
financial situation.</p>

<p>My English is definitely being affected by teaching.</p>
