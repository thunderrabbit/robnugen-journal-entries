<p class=dream>Dreamt that I was old friends with Eminem and that he
was basically a nice guy who got really popular by emphasizing his
pissed off side.  We talked a bit about old times and how's the family
and stuff like that.  He asked how my mom was doing and she showed up
in the dream and tickled him a bit like she always did with us
(*).</p>

<p class=dream>I talked to Em a bit like, "man I bet you've been busy
as fuck with all this concert shit going on and all that."</p>

<p class=dream>He was like yeah and stuff and asked how things were
going for me.  I thought it was cool that he remembered my name,
etc.</p>

<p>(*) actually I don't remember her ever tickling me.</p>
