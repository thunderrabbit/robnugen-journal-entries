<p><em>Killing Me Softly</em> is a ridiculous movie.</p>

<p>Here's the bottom line: don't marry someone that you've known for 2
days.  Don't break up a relationship for someone who you've known for
an hour.</p>

<p>This character Alice is a ridiculous woman.  Who the fuck would do
what she's doing in this movie?  (Why am I continuing to watch the
movie?)</p>

<p>Andrew and I are watching it; the movie is probably half over.
This character Adam is damn creeeepy.</p>

<p>Summary: Andrew is fired from choosing movies.</p>
