<p class=dream>Dreamt that I was invited to one more rally.  Eeek!  I
felt honored and a bit weird to attend after I said I'd already
attended my last, and I wondered if I'd be able to remember all the
names of all the kittens I should know.</p>

<p class=dream>We arrived via bus at the Canadian side of Niagra falls
and saw a model of the city in the water below us, floating like a
future version of our society, one filled with glittering beauty all
around.  I realized it was a dream and ran off the edge of the bluff
and flew out over the water, inviting others to come with me.  No one
else could fly like me.</p>

<p class=dream>In a big circle of people someone said "I did something
on next Thursday ago," and I helped prompt him to correct his English.
He got it without me fully giving it away.</p>
