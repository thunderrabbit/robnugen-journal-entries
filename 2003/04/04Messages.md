<p class=date>1:04pm JST Friday 4 April 2003</p>

<p>I'm in Tsunashima train station waiting for a train to Ueno, where
I'll meet Janelle, Kevin, Andrew to ooh and ahh over cherry blossom
trees.  I expect they'll be quite lovely, but I wonder if they will
meet my expectations...</p>

<p>I chatted with Janette (& Sean a little bit (& Josephine a very
little bit)) and Marcel this morning.  Janette and I had set up an
electronic date just for chatting.  Good stuff.  Got the latest on the
Dallas-YRUU front.</p>

<p>Here's my train.</p>

<p>Okay; I'll take this train to Shibuya (one of the big stations on
the train-track-loop around Tokyo) and then take the loop to the
opposite side (almost exactly according to this not-to-scale map) of
Tokyo to Ueno (another big station on the loop around Tokyo) where I
hope I can follow the directions in Janelle's text message (the phones
here are one's dream or nightmare).</p>

<p>Haha I just wrote a message to DruDaddyG and spelled Shibuya with
hiragana instead of romanji.  Man, talk about fun!  My ideas of fun
have certainly changed......</p>

<p>I told Dru that I'm going to SHIBUYA and he's all, "why are you
going to SHIBUYA, we are going to UENO" (and the station names (all
caps here) were in hiragana) so I wrote back</p>
