<p class=date>11:26pm JST Friday 18 April 2003</p>

<p>Totally pumped</p>

<p>I'm learning Japanese</p>

<p>I've got three (3) different classes for the price of one!!!1 <! 1
is intentional></p>

<p>I'm paying Ayana 3000 yen per 1.5 hour classes, and I'm paying Koko
100 yen per 2 hour classes, and I'm paying the international lounge
100 yen per 2 hour classes!</p>

<p>Tonight I met with Ayana for the first time.  She came to the
Starbucks (aahhhh!! they're everywhere!) near my work at 7pm and
waited until 9pm when I got off.  She told me about ko and so and ah
and I can tell very quickly that I'm not going to be typing in my
journal all that I learn.</p>

<p>She gave me several nouns and how to ask what is this and where is
that and what time is it and the answers to what time is it for the
top and bottoms of the hours.</p>

<p>AND she said that if I study, I'll be speaking Japanese in three
months.  Awesome.</p>
