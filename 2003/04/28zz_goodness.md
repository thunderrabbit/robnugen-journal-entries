<p><em>FOUND</em> on the map where my bike is being held hostage.
It's not exactly walking distance away, but now at least I'll know
where the fuck I am after I get it and will be able to ride home.  I
had to do some kanji pattern matching to figure out where it was, but
I did it.  Alright.</p>

<p>Got a notice of a package from janette!</p>

<p>bed bed bed bed bedtime.</p>
