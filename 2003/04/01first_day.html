<p class=date>2:28am JST Wednesday 2 April 2003</p>

<p>First day was fine.  Little bit long at the end.  We worked until
just after 9pm.  Each new teacher (four of us) led parts of one class:
the introduction "hi; what's yer name" and... shit I just realized I
didn't do the homework we were given to do tonight.  watched a movie
instead about Michael Douglas chasing some young Japanese Yazuka
mobster-wanna-be around Japan.</p>

<p>Anyway, we led the first and last part of the lesson, which my
trainer said are the hardest parts.</p>

<p>While in training, I had a flash of when I was at KTRU being
trained as a DJ by Alexis.  How I was all nervous but kept a good
attitude and tried to keep myself calm and cool like a cool
cucumber.</p>

<p>That flash gave me solace.  I know I can do this.  I've been
nervous at new jobs before.  This is cake.</p>

<p>Gotta sleep to get up and have more cake tomorrow.</p>


<p>Oh:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We ate at a sushi train today.  (Little conveyor belt of plates
of sushis go by and we eat whatever we want, stack up the plates and
get charged by the resulting stack of plates.)  Salita is also from OZ
(Melbourne) but she "eats only chicken," so it was a stretch for her
to eat sushi.  I had a hard time understanding why she would come here
to Japan, plus here to a sushi bar.</p></li>

<li><p>Olivia is from OZ (Adelade (sp)) and lives in the same building
as I.</p></li>

<li><p>We rode the train back together after Steve helped us get our
train passes good for a month.</p></li>

<li><p>She has a boyfriend type person, far as I can tell.  She's off
the list cause she's as young as some of my ex-youth.</p></li>

<li><p>It takes about 45 minutes on the 2 trains to get to work.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Good night.</p>

<br>Rob!!! You inconceivable bastard!<br>
<br>
So the other day I decided that it would be really fucking great to instead of going back to school and spending
    even more money on classes to learn languages, just go to other countries and learn them for free!<br>
<br>
and theeeeeeen i was talking with this girl at work and she was like, "yeah, my friend went to japan and they
    actually PAID her to do it!"<br>
<br>
And guess who it was with, rob, can you guess? because bastards can always guess.<br>
<br>
So, now it seems like you are officially my life role model. I am glad you are having fun, and now i need to bug
    you alot more than my crummy website ever needed to set my short term goals for my life. I'm really happy and proud
    of you, man.<br>
<br>
Now it's my turn to be the watcher in awe.<br>
