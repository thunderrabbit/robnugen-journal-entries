<p>In a quest to meet people, we're going to a party thrown by his
homey Ben tonight.  But the party starts at 9 and trains end at
midnight.  It'll be a 2 hour party max if I want to go home tonight.

the AM.  That would be interesting.  We'll see what happens.</p>

<p>But first we're going to Dru's to watch Simpsons and I'll probably
sleeeep.<p class=date>7:54am</p></p>
