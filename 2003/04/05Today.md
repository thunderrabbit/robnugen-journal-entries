<p class=date>7:42pm JST Saturday 5 April 2003</p>

<p>Today at work was much better than I thought it might be.  I
basically would just wing every class, doing no preparation except
choosing a lesson number beforehand.  I mentioned this to one of the
guys there, like "man I got this shit <em>down</em> - just winging the
whole operation."</p>

<p>And he's like "you don't really want to say that on your first
day."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Over confidence," he said as if it were two words.</p>

<p>Dude.  Whatever.  If I got this shit down, or at least think I do,
then fuckin' whatever.  Yeah I told him.</p>

<p>Actually I didn't say anything but made a mental note to not tell
him anything interesting anymore.</p>
