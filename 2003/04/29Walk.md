<p>A coin toss encouraged me to walk to ÇµÇÒÅ[ÇÊÇ±ÇÕÇ‹ instead of home.
I did this in search of a bank.  Found a bank but it also wouldn't
take my passbook.   Information phone beside the thing revealed that I
would be able to use the passbook tomorrow.</p>

<p>Walked from ÇµÇÒÅ[ÇÊÇ±ÇÕÇ‹ to home in 40 minutes.</p>
