<p>I just talked to Janette and it was great!!  18 minutes of
yammering about everything we've done in the past week on a Brastel
phone card given to me by Nova.  Good job, Brastel, you got my
business.</p>

<p>Best news from the Dallas front is Janette's space in Austin is
selling like yummy hotcakes!  The yellow table, the something else and
that other thing are all sold, plus tons of other stuff.  Excellent!
I'm so excited for her for that!</p>

<p>Gave her the lowdown on the haps in Japan, that I still basically
can't read anything, but that it's slowly coming together every
day.</p>

<p>Told her about Eminem and Beastie Boys concerts coming soon to a
country near me!</p>

<p>That final minute on the phone card went by like ziiiinngg!</p>
