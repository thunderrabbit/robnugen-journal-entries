<p>In 4 hours, happy one month being in Japan anniversary to me.</p>

<p>Damn.  I just went to break while I had a lesson to teach.  Every
day prior to this I have worked four shifts, gotten my lunch, then
worked four more shifts.</p>

<p>Today it was 5 and 3.</p>

<p>Eric was 4 and 4, and since he's a cool cat (and has been here for
a while and seems to handle everything quite smoothly (maybe I should
get input from him about how to be a cool cat) even during the busiest
of times) he covered my shift for me with no apparent difficulty or
stress.  Oh thank goodness no AT was there today (Laura was our boss
today and she could hardly give a rat's butt about anything; she has 6
more days of Nova before she's all "sayonara suckas!" to us when she
goes back to England.</p>
