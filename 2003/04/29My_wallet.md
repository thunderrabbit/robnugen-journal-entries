<p>Magically, I got on the same bus with the same driver that I used
to get here.  He remembered me when I was all like, "maybe not same
bus" to indicate that maybe it wasn't this bus, hoping that explained
why my wallet isn't here.</p>

<p>All the explaining was done at the end of the line (we were close
to the end of the line (like 2 stops away) at the Bike Pound stop)
where I now have the opportunity to wait (study) 45 minutes (I think)
before it's time for the bus to go again.</p>

<p>I had a good cry alone on the bus (as the driver got out to stretch
and do whatever he does while scared wallet-losing bike-losing gaijin
are on his bus crying) wrote this entry and here I am.</p>

<p>Time to study more Japanese.  and I don't just mean that in the
proverbial kinda way; I'm going to study right</p>

<p>now.</p>

<p class=date>10:25am</p>

<p>Back at home.  The bus started again before I had time to fully
open my book, but on the way home I learned four verbs:</p>

<p>to eat ÇΩÅ◊ÅÈ
<br>to sleep ÅÀÅÈ
<br>to see ÅﬂÅÈ
<br>to get up Å®Ç´ÅÈ</p>

<p>I've dug through everything in my room. No wallet.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Now I'm going back to the police station to tell them what else
I've lost. (phone (recovered), bike, wallet)</p>

<p class=date>12:42pm</p>

<p>Went to the cops, told them my sad tale of woe (they had to call a
bilingual cat on the phone to get my info) and practiced a tidbit of
Japanese with them.  Like "come" "go" and "came" and "little bit"
though these are not yet committed to my memory.</p>

<p>I told them all the items I could remember that are in the wallet:
<br>70,000 yen
<br>gaijin card
<br>TX drivers license
<br>US bank card
<br>Japanese bank card
<br>proof that I can use the bike
<br>my Japan address written in Japanese
</p>

<p>Point is, they'll call me when the wallet is returned.</p>

<p>Part of me wanted to sulk and pout until the wallet was returned - 
to stop all activity and just curl up until the wallet situation fixed 
itself.  I consciously had to choose not to.  All the "success books" 
of all the "successful" people that I've read talk about their wins and 
losses.   And with the losses, the just have to start over.  Just start 
again.  Fine.  I can do it.  Release the outcome.</p>

<p>I decided to start over with a new wallet so I went to the bank with
my bank passbook (checkbook that has a magnetic strip, and the ATM
prints in the passbook my balance and such!) but the ATMs were only
happy to take cards, not passbooks.  They all have passbook slots, but
those didn't seem to be activated.  ATMs in Japan are not open
24-hours.<p>

<p>So...  I cannot yet start over with a new wallet.</p>

<p>I used 110 yen of my remaining change to take a train to pick up a
box from the post office.  The guy there asked for my ID and I
gestured that I didn't have any, but I showed him on my computer my
address in Japan which he confirmed was the address for the package
and let me have the package.  Yay for trust in Japanese culture.</p>

<p>Now instead of my wallet, I have <em>chocolate chip cookies!!</em>  
I'm going to walk home to save 110 yen and I don't think it will be 
<em>that</em> far - just 1 or 1.25 train stops away I believe.</p>

<p>The good thing, no matter how far it is to my apartment - I have
chocolate chip cookies from Janette!!!!</p>
