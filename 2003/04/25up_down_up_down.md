<p>up:</p>

<p>Grrrreat Voice Room today; we yammered a bit and then I introduced
the Opposite Game with them.   "What is the opposite of red?"
"Green."  "What is the opposite of blue?"  "Yellow."  (close enough)
"What is the opposite of an eraser?"</p>

<p>This is a great game for high level students.  Dammn it's the best
game ever.  Incredible super duper thanks to Wende for inventing it
with me!</p>

<p>I came up with a cheesy one.  What is the opposite of an Air
Conditioner?  Shampoo.  Why?  I added an H before Air.  Terrible pun.
Not even an opposite really.  But whatever; they liked it.</p>

<p>down:</p>

<p>Soon as I got into work Steve was all, "what's going on with your
shoes?" cause I'm wearing some oh-god-say-it-isn't-so!!! light brown
leather shoes.  Man fuck that.  I lied something like, "oh, I didn't
have a chance to get home and change; I chose to be here on time than
to have my other shoes."  Bite me.</p>

<p>up:</p>

<p>On the way home Clayton got on the train with one of his friends.
I tried a little bit of Japanese conversation with him.  Stuff like
what is your phone number and how old are you?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>down:</p>

<p>Fuck!</p>

<p>I've been blessed with the opportunity to live without my bike for
an unspecified length of time.</p>

<p>Fuck fuck fuck!</p>

<p>I went to the cops and they were all, "oh no pahking zone"</p>

<p>WTF???  There's 50 fucking bicycles there right now where I parked
mine this morning and mine got jacked and those all stayed?  What the
fuck is up with that?  No signs?</p>

<p>You mean this isn't a <em>bicycle rack</em> ?????   What the hell
is it then?  A length of pole to sit on?  I don't think so.</p>

<p>I'm quite interested to know what my bike did so differently from
the other bikes.</p>

<p>They gave me a sheet of paper indicating a phone number and
bankers' hours that it's available.  I wonder what adventures are in
store for me and my bike.</p>

<p>And it's not even my bike!!!  Argh!!!!!</p>

<p>up:</p>

<p>I got ice cream on the way home to indulge myself.</p>

<p>up:</p>

<p>I arrived home (which took nearly 25 thousand times longer without
a bike!!!!!!!!!!!!!), and found a letter from janette.   :-)</p>

Dude, I have to make the hateful suggestion.  Your coworkers at Nova probably don't read your journal yet, but IMO you have to assume that they will eventually as they come to know you, since it's such an integral part of your life.  You have to assume that eventually, uncool people will read your website, and, eventually, people will see how much you disdain Steve.  Steve is not he kind of guy who will support your freedom of speech, and may have the power to mangle your career.  <br>
<br>
I can't suggest any more that you "be a good boy," because clearly Steve is a micromanager who isn't capable of letting you make decisions for yourself.(*)  I can only suggest that you find a way to get away from him as soon as possible, because the longer you work under him, the more you will hate Nova specifically and your Japan experience generally.  None of us want that.  Find the cool important people and impress them.  See what magic they can work for you.  In the mean time, I think you should make private the things you say about him, lest they make trouble for you in the future.  I know you hate to censor yourself, and I'm sure you've done an admirable job so far--I'm sure that in your private journal there are things so poisonous as to get you fired.  I think you need to go further and, yes, censor more.  <br>
<br>
I've been thinking of suggesting this ever since you started talking about Steve.  This entry seems to take things a step further than you really want to go.  <br>
<br>
(*)I suggest that you think of it like this:  His criticism of you simply demonstrates his own inability to be a good manager.  He comments on every little detail the same way Karen does because he is incapable of helping people grow the way you have been doing for six years and counting.  I know it grates upon everything you base your life upon, and I'm sorry.  <br>
<br>
I hope you are getting enough satisfaction from your interactions with your students to overshadow your boss' poor management skills.  <br>
<br>
Love,<br>
