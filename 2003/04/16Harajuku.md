<p>Kickin' it in Harajuku with Andrew and Ben.  We're eating crepes
(they) and ice cream (me) at a cool little cafe thing with the coolest
C-shaped brick tunnel thing in which the employees stand while behind
the counter.</p>

<p>I've taken many pictures of funny / fucked up English on T-shirts
and signs.</p>

<p>At a shrine, I bought a souvenier or three.  (Three)  The sample
souvenier fell when the girl selected a boxed one for me.  I tried to
catch it, but instead picked up the pieces.  Shoulda taken a picture
of it first, but oh well.</p>

<p>Saw a woman wearing traditional somethinsomethin having her photo
taken by several people, including some tourists, including me.  I
overheard a bystander say that it costs $10,000 US to have a wedding
there at the shrine.</p>
