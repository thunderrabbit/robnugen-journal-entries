<p>I had a dream in Japanese!</p>

<p class=dream>Homer Simpson knew Japanese; he was wearing glasses and
asking Ned to fill out a form with the prompts written in Japanese.
Between them, a woman who could read hiragana was trying to help
Ned.</p>

<p class=dream>Homer knew English but didn't translate anything for
Ned cause, being Homer, he didn't think about it and realize this
would be helpful.  He just let the woman stumble through reading the
hiragana and wondered why Ned was clueless not understanding
anything.</p>
