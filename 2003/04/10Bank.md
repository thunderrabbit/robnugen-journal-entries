<p>Whoohoo!  I just got my bank card here in Japan.  Now I just gotta
find which ATMs I can use.  Then I just gotta get my first paycheck on
15 May.</p>

<p>I called my US bank and they said they can't request a funds
transfer from my Japanese bank.  Benny has said we have to wire them,
or maybe he said we could wire them but there's a cheaper way; I
forget; I'll ask him.</p>
