<p>There's a giant golden turd crowning a black mirrored glass curvey
building.</p>

<p>It's actualy suppoed to be a golden flame and this is a brewer
thought it looks more like an office building.</p>

<p>The sun beams glow through the clouds occassionally as mostly cloudy
skies scurry by overhead.  I'm stretched out backwards on the hard
plastic "glass bricks" comprising stairs up to the brewery.  Not
perfectly comfortable, but a nice stretch to offset my backpack.  I
could fall asleep right here but` Dru is chompin' at the bit to eat.</p>

<p>That Dru, always good for a laugh has been secretly pressing keys
while I type with my eyes shut and head back on the steps..  extra
apostrophe by but is his doing.</p>

<p>We've learned a kanji character today "kawa" which means river.
It's basically three vertical lines.  Aright.</p>
