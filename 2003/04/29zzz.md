<p class=date>1:59am JST Wednesday 30 April 2003</p>

<p>Studied for some hours and then got sidetracked with Nine Inch
Nails music in my head, specifically the end of "Perfect Drug."</p>

<p>During my sidetrackedness, I've just created a nin compilation for
Jackie, who expressed interest in nin music some weeks ago on LJ.  I
love nin so I want to encourage her appreciation of the music.</p>

<p>My intentions for tomorrow:</p>

<p>!) That I go to the police box and they'll have my wallet
<br>@) If no wallet, I'll go to the bank and get cash
<br>#) Regardless of walletification, I'll buy a new chain-wallet
<br>$) Meet Koko at international lounge and embark with her:
<br>%) if no old wallet, to get a new gaijin card
<br>^) bicycle recovery mission, no matter how many wallets I've got.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
