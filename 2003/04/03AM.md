<p class=date>10:50am JST Thursday 3 April 2003</p>

<p>Woke up feeling grrr and spiteful about going to work.  "I'll show
him and fucking spend *!<em>EXACTLY</em>!* ten minutes on each of the
four parts of each lesson" and be all BAM show you motherfucker that I
can keep to a schedule</p>

<p>or basically *skip* a section altogether but make the rest of the
lessons <em>SO PERFECT</em> that the students are leaving all
"whutwhut!" so happy and learning so much just to fucking prove to
Stevey that timing can bite the big one and still have an awesome
lesson.</p>

<p>and then I'm all, <em>breathe.  take it easy, big guy</em> etc and
then I read several LJs that I downloaded last night.</p>

<p>Now that my LJ reprieve is over, I'm all grrr again.  </p>

<p>Take it easy big guy.</p>
