<p>Dru's all, "so....   You've *never* been drunk?"</p>

<p>"Nope."</p>

<p>"My goal..."</p>

<p>I thought he was going to say "my goal is to get drunk," and I'm
like damn G there's more interesting things in life than that!</p>

<p>"..is to get you drunk."</p>

<p>I tried to bet him 10,000 yen that he wouldn't, but he said with
that much money on it I of course wouldn't do it.</p>

<p>"I'm going to get you drunk even if I have to inject it in your
arm."</p>

<p>We'll see, big guy, we'll see.</p>
