<p>Weird.</p>

<p>The staff says the bike-recovery-directions say something like, "to
get your bike back, start at Å¬Ç»ÇµÅ‹ station and follow these
directions."</p>

<p>But, they were not able to find Tsunashima station on the map on
said piece of paper.</p>

<p>They were able to find the destination on the map, near a high
school.</p>

<p>Apparently the directions include taking a bus, which will be a
first for me in Japan.</p>
