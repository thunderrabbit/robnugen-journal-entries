Tazura is a beautiful weimereiner, but I think weimereiners are beautiful by definition.

I don't yet know how to organize our android app.

I finished my first Roy G Biv hex maze today. Just need to scan it.

Tomorrow I'll attend Kevin's advanced shamanism course, day 1 of 4 of advanced practice. I guess I should practice on my own as well as attend his classes.

I feel conflicted; I want to keep working on the Android project for work.
