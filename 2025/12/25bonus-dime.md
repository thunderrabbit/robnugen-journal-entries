Wow nice!

I just volunteered to be bumped from this flight and fly tomorrow.  

When I went up to the gate, I found ten cents on the floor.  Wooo! Thank you Spirit for financial abundance 🙏 

About 30 seconds after I volunteered, the guy said they were no longer overbooked, so I will fly today.  He thanked me for volunteering, shook my hand and wished me Merry Christmas .. And I still have bonus ten cents yeah!
