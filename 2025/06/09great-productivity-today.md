After working 3.75 hours on Marble Track 3, during which I glued the S
mall Marble Saver
and documented the network of parts around the 
Lowest Small Marble Splitter, 
I went to the city tax office and confirme I've paid all my past city taxes and confirmed when I will receive the upcoming city tax bills (in August) and how to pay them online.

I got two vegan obentos from Bio c' Bon for today and tomorrow and ate lunch.

I worked on Marble Track 3 another hour during which I glued the Triple Splitter Small Feeder Inner Guider in place:

Now headed to Nathan's presentation about how to anchor emotions. I'm not sure if I'll learn anything new, but I want to support him and I'll see other men in the men's group.
