<p class="dream">I was enjoying myself in my office and just enjoying singing and being happy. Not loud but just not caring. Who could hear me? And I was quoting Steven Greer talking about the pronunciation of people saying fire tower as "far tar" In his hometown while I was working on marble track 3 and having a really good time and actually talking to Steven Greer about a mutual friend of mine who he knew and he's like "Oh yeah, I know him really well" and they used to work together in  Virginia and it was really cool to have that confirmation and before I could start to dive into those types of stories I realized that it was suddenly 7:34 p.m. and I hadn't realized the time and now I was not just "too late to leave," but The meeting in Shinagawa had literally already started and I just fell into abject terror or shock or such an abomination and was crying crying just furiously crying. I couldn't believe the situation and that was the only thing I cared about today. It was suddenly taken away and I was so sad and crying and just allowing myself to be so devastated and just expressing this huge ugly cry and that I realized maybe this is a dream and I checked the time on my other device and it said midnight and I thought "well that's not right, but at least it's different" and from there I was able to slowly wake up and</p>

realize I'm in the middle of a nap. It's now 15:55 p.m. so I'm fine not late and all that stuff is really amazing to just be so much and abject horror about the time being lost and so devastated to be missing the second meeting which was really important for me.
