<p class="dream">I was driving Mr Van across a beautiful hilly desert landscape.</p>

<p class="dream">Later I was in a library working on Marble Track 3 art project but then I forgot to put it away.</p>

<p class="dream">I went down to the restroom which turned out to be in a hotel which was running a nightly event of some kind of free love sex party, and there was a guy with two college age girls going in and it was the girls first time and they were excitedly talking about "getting lots of dick" so the host took them to the side and said "since it's your first time, let me tell you what you won't be getting," presumably as a way to gently let them down, and they said "awww" but then he continued by saying "pregnant" and showed them where to get unlimited free condoms.</p>

<p class="dream">I went down the steps to look for the restroom and there were lots of people who had all just presumably had sex but were all wearing clothes and just laying around on the floor looking happy and lovey-dovey. A few comments were made toward me as I gently walked by barefoot stepping in between them so as to not hurt anybody nor make them move.</p>

<p class="dream">I got past that group and turned left in the hallway toward the restroom area where more people were upright, but when I went into the restroom area it turned out it was just sinks and bunks for sleeping.</p>

<p class="dream">I couldn't find the restroom so I went back out and headed back the way I had come, turning right to walk past all the people who were happily laying on the floor.  This time they weren't as densely packed, so I was able to walk through easily.  When I got to the stairs I decided to go up two at a time and another woman to my right to the same thing, so I thought that was neat.</p>

<p class="dream">Arriving at the top of the stairs I had some kind of strange memory of having an affair with Anna, but I couldn't remember the details, and thought about asking her if we had done anything.</p>

<p class="dream">Then I was in the library where I had been working on Marble Track 3, and I realized I couldn't remember if I had put it away.  I was walking along the first floor of the library, and noticed they were closing.</p>

<p class="dream">There were some corporate type men coming toward me talking about business and walking out the door.  I playfully took long steps over the roughly hewn brown jute carpet and then realized I was somehow climbing up a purple rubber wall to get up to the second level of the library.</p>

<p class="dream">I thought, "oh this is handy," because I knew the library was closing I shouldn't be up there but I just happened to be able to get up there, and if I got caught I could claim that I just had not been ushered out by the staff.</p>

<p class="dream">Even so, to evade detection as my goal was to get back to Marble Track 3, I walked on all fours, (without even using my knees) so my legs and arms were just holding me up as if in a wide low plank.</p>

<p class="dream">As I crept forward on the floor, I found a pair of lost glasses, so I held them with one hand as I kept moving toward where I had been working on the marble track.</p>

<p class="dream">I got a place where I had to go down an escalator, which would have been hard to go down head first like that, so I decided I'd have to risk it and stand up, but it turned out the escalator was actually flat like a slide, so I was able to slide down.</p>

<p class="dream">At that point some of the friendly stuff down below saw me and said, "oh hey! There is some free chili over here if you're interested," which I wasn't interested in chili but I made a joke dripping with sarcasm like "oh I'm so sorry that I'm late, (because now I get free chili)" so from her perspective sounded like sarcasm as if I was happy to get the chili, while from my perspective could mean otherwise.</p>

<p class="dream">I climbed down from the second floor down onto a couple of stacked boxes and a copy machine then down to the floor, where is she and a couple of her friends /colleagues greeted me.</p>

<p class="dream">I turned in the glasses to her " hey, I found these upstairs," and she started to test them by flexing the lenses which then I noticed were cracked and broken.  I said "oh, I didn't realize it was broken," not realizing that flexing the lenses could have broken them.</p>
