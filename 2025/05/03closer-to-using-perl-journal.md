I've got a couple more hours of manual tweakin' to do before I can begin to merge my journal entries from my previous journal into my current journal entries so they can all be presented by my previous journal presenter.

* Previous journal entries were written by hand in HTML.
* They were shown by my awesome index with a calendar written in Perl.
* In an attempt to upgrade my website, I switched to Wordpress (horrifying), Ghost (meh), Jekyll (slow), Hugo (fast)
* Somewhere along the line, I started writing a story, backwards, one word at a time in my journal commit messages.
* Hugo processes markdown files and can pass-through HTML files
* Current journal entries are written by hand in markdown.
* They are shown in my boring Hugo journal.
* My Perl journal couldn't handle markdown, and I couldn't handle writing in HTML anymore.
* I tried to upgrade all my old HTML files to markdown which required adding frontmatter.
* Now that ChatGPT is sufficiently capable to write in Perl, it helped me write a markdown parser.
* Now my awesome old journal with a calendar can parse markdown.
* The backward story *MUST* be retained, so the HTML files need to be converted back to HTML in my current journal
* This could be a simple as stripping the frontmatter, but I'm also manually restoring and redacting comments at the same time.
* Almost there...
