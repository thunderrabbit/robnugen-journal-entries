I haven't had consistent access to Ye Olde Worlde Wide Webbe while chilling in Riverdell with Jess.

It's only been slightly disruptive to my schedule as I'm primarily supporting her Transforming Trauma retreat, not working online.

The unique part: I don't know why I don't have access.  My laptop can access the web through the local wifi but my phone cannot consistently do the same.

Is it because my eSIM recently ran out of days it's allowed to work?  I turned it off, but still wifi ain't doing its thing.

I tried renewing my eSIM but used a different email address so it didn't extend my current subscription properly.

I wish their info would say something like (use you's same address) on the Top Up page.
