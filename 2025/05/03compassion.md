It's 14:28pm as I start writing this.

About 15 minutes ago, Jess asked that I have some compassion for her. 

In my mind I've had compassion for her since 8:30 a.m. when we found out some surprising news.

14 minus 8 is 6.

So for about 6 hours I have been supporting and listening and sitting and encouraging self-care, practicing self-care, checking in on Jess, monitoring her recovery. 

About 15 minutes ago after she expressed herself and her situation, she asked how I was feeling. 

I said I'm feeling concerned for her because the situation has impacted her more than I expected it might. 

Then when I felt deeper into it I said something like "I'm feeling frustrated because I thought this would be a 'couple time' so I would love to walk with you and in hand in the sunshine before it gets dark."

She said she hopes I can have some compassion for her. 

She then said that there's no reason for me to be concerned.  She's just processing her emotions.

*don't ask me how I'm feeling if you can't hold space for the answer.*

### 15:30

When I got back to the room, Jess was awake from her rest.  She apologized for not holding space for me after asking how I felt.

I cried saying "I felt so sad to hear you ask for compassion after I had been expressing compassion all day," 

Then she did it *again*, saying "I just thought it could have been expressed differently."

What the actual fuck.  I felt anger and was able to own it and said, "even just now when I'm crying, it seems like you're defending yourself."

She then really held space for me and I felt acknowledged.

We're good again now.
