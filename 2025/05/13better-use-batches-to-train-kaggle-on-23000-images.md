Can you write a poem about the situation in this screenshot?

Absolutely — here’s a poem for this dramatic moment:

---

💔 **Ode to the Fallen Kernel**

**Twas hour one, a noble quest,**
To train a model with our best.
Images lined in tidy rows,
URLs and labels — off it goes.

**Each byte was fetched with earnest pride,**
From CloudFront's vaults both far and wide.
Twenty-three thousand, queued and true,
Until… the RAM it *overgrew*.

**A quiet snap — a puff, a sigh,**
The memory bar had climbed too high.
Kaggle’s whisper: *“You asked too much,”*
And shut it down with just one touch.

**A box appeared, so cold and flat,**
“Kernel Restarting.” Just like that.
No tear, no beep, no drawn-out fade —
Just dreams reset and work unsaved.

But we, undaunted, shall not yield.
We'll batch, we’ll split, we’ll stay the field.
For files live in code and flame,
And models rise — despite the blame.
