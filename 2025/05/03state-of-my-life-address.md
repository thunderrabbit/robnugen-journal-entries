# Jess and I are in Hillier, Australia near Adelaide, chilling in Riverdell
# Over the past couple of days, I've been helping her with her Transforming Trauma retreat 
# It has gone really really really well 
# It was very easy for me to be of service and Jess said it really helped to have my support
# This experience has really brought me and Jess closer together
# Last night we had a nice chat with one of the participants because all the others had gone home or out 
# This is my first time in Riverdell, so while I can see the loft is in two smaller buildings, I had never seen it all as one unit as Jess had
# It's 4:30 a.m. as I write this while on the loo
# To get here, I streaked across the gap between the two little buildings.
# The moon was just recently new  and I've enjoyed watching the dark sky
# During Jess' workshop I expressed a huge amount of anger, guilt, sadness and despair, as to why I never got to finish my relationship with janette.
# (it's because I stayed in Japan after moving there in 2003)
# Quick (https://github.com/thunderrabbit/Quick) can edit existing entries but adds an extra year to the tags each time an entry gets edited 
# Quick reliably adds a single word to my backwards story but can't handle words with apostrophes in them
# With AI support I was able to get my perl journal to handle markdown 
# I'm in the process of editing the old HTML entries which got converted to markdown back into HTML, basically by stripping the front matter.  
# I'm going through them one by one because I'm adding comments and I need to fix the text encoding for some of the entries
# This process has let me know what I gave up when I moved to Japan, and how much I had forgotten about how hard that was
# I will be back in Tokyo on May 8th 
# I told Lin, "Well I miss my friends but I'm not ready to be immersed in Japanese language again"
# I'm still working on AB, and recently got their image server under  my purview 
# yikes It's on an old server that needs upgrading
# I'm hoping when this entry is parsed by my perl journal, it will show up with hiragana as the counters 
# I just created an Issue for that https://github.com/thunderrabbit/Perl_driven_calendar_journal_from_2012/issues/24
# I'm nearing completion of I'M FINE (the version that stays scientific and focuses just on the personal value of noticing emotions)
# Deneys just turned in his thoughts after reading my draft but I haven't parsed them yet. 
# I expect to get some notes from Jacob as well. 
# I reached out to Hassan who's on standby for my final manuscript #wooohoooooo 
# I'm not sure when I'll be back in OZ, but I'll be back
# I want to continue creating Marble Track 3 construction video
# I plan to attend Parklands I Group meeting on Monday; I've really enjoyed attending while being in Adelaide
