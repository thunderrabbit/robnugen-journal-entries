#### 4:26 Saturday 3 May 2025

1. Jess and I are in Hillier, Australia near Adelaide, chilling in Riverdell
2. Over the past couple of days, I've been helping her with her Transforming Trauma retreat 
3. It has gone really really really well 
4.  It was very easy for me to be of service and Jess said it really helped to have my support
5. This experience has really brought me and Jess closer together
6. Last night we had a nice chat with one of the participants because all the others had gone home or out 
7. This is my first time in Riverdell, so while I can see the loft is in two smaller buildings, I had never seen it all as one unit as Jess had
8. It's 4:30 a.m. as I write this while on the loo
9. To get here, I streaked across the gap between the two little buildings.
10. The moon was just recently new  and I've enjoyed watching the dark sky.
11. During Jess' workshop I expressed a huge amount of anger, guilt, sadness and despair, as to why I never got to finish my relationship with janette.
12. (it's because I stayed in Japan after moving there in 2003)
13. Quick (https://github.com/thunderrabbit/Quick) can edit existing entries but adds an extra year to the tags each time an entry gets edited 
14. Quick reliably adds a single word to my backwards story but can't handle words with apostrophes in them
15. With AI support I was able to get my perl journal to handle markdown 16. I'm in the process of editing the old HTML entries which got converted to markdown back into HTML, basically by stripping the front matter.  
17. I'm going through them one by one because I'm adding comments and I need to fix the text encoding for some of the entries
18. This process has let me know what I gave up when I moved to Japan, and how much I had forgotten about how hard that was
19. I will be back in Tokyo on May 8th 
20. I told Lin, "Well I miss my friends but I'm not ready to be immersed in Japanese language again"
21. I'm still working on AB, and recently got their image server under  my purview 
22. yikes It's on an old server that needs upgrading
23. I'm hoping when this entry is parsed by my perl journal, it will show up with hiragana as the counters 
24. I just created an Issue for that https://github.com/thunderrabbit/Perl_driven_calendar_journal_from_2012/issues/24
25. I'm nearing completion of I'M FINE (the version that stays scientific and focuses just on the personal value of noticing emotions)
26.Deneys just turned in his thoughts after reading my draft but I haven't parsed them yet. 
27. I expect to get some notes from Jacob as well. 
28. I reached out to Hassan who's on standby for my final manuscript #wooohoooooo 
29. I'm not sure when I'll be back in OZ, but I'll be back
30. I want to continue creating Marble Track 3 construction video
31. I plan to attend Parklands I Group meeting on Monday; I've really enjoyed attending while being in Adelaide
32. The first time I wrote this I used hash marks instead of numbers for each numbered item in the list.
