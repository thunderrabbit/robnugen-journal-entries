<p class="dream">Lin and I were still married and I was walking near our house where a guy had some nice vehicles parked.  I noticed that my friend had not removed his belay line from the wall, although when he put the line up he specifically said it was easy to remove.</p>

<p class="dream">I tried to remove it with the few shakes I had seen him do but I didn't know exactly how to do it and had some trouble getting the rope down.</p>

<p class="dream">By the time I got the rope down there were some people wondering what I was doing including the owner of the property, who thought I was up to no good.</p>

<p class="dream">He and his friends work questioning me and trying to figure out who I was and such and how I had gotten into this situation.  I simply stayed silent, not letting them know that I could pretty much understand them.</p>

<p class="dream">The owner was hypothesizing that I may have been in jail and the other one said "well how did he get his ID and he looks perfectly clean and fine, not like a vagrant."</p>

<p class="dream">At one point I finally spoke up in English because one of them could speak English.  I asked, "what do you think I did back there?"</p>

<p class="dream">When they had no idea, I said "I did literally nothing," which was not literally true because I had undone the thing that my friend did, but in total the final result was we had done nothing.</p>

<p class="dream">I then continued saying, "as for the mystery of my identity, I live right over there and you can come talk to my wife if you want, and she'll freak out so she might have a panic attack and that's on you because I haven't done anything."</p>

<p class="dream">They let me go, locking the door so that I couldn't go back onto their property, so I went down the hill and just around the other direction, and back home to Lin where she was making chocolate in the kitchen.</p>

<p class="dream">She asked if I had any news, so I characterized the situation by saying "I left my wallet at a neighbor's house so I'll go get it later."</p>

<p class="dream">She asked if there was a problem, so I said "well, they thought I was doing something wrong but I wasn't, so there's no problem."</p>

There were a few signs which I didn't notice this was a dream:

<ol>
<li><span class="dream">The rope didn't come down easily even though it had been tied to do so</span></li>
<li><span class="dream"> The neighborhood wasn't quite right: it was basically a small version geographically and the cliff was down below the house instead of just above the house</span></li>
<li><span class="dream"> I was still married</span></li>
<li><span class="dream">I wasn't wearing clothes while out in public</span></li>
</ol>
