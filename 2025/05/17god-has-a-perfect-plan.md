This morning I woke up with a vision of incorporating my written journal into my book by giving book readers a glimpse into my world. 

After reading the book there will be a post script of the book that says "I'm just a silly old man who is trying to write a book after stumbling through life and you can see that life at my website" and give the URL to my website and journal. 

Then welcome people to come along with me as I have a plan to write three more books culminating(?) in the fact(!) that we are living inside a quantum computer and say there's possibly a big reveal (universe is a quantum computer), but the literal reveal is that your body is a quantum computer (and the science is backing that up). 

I won't talk about it at length because I don't know quantum physics but I am on this adventure of writing my book and my marble track and my journal and I'd love for you to come along with me.

If you're the kind of person who has enjoyed this book and wants to tune in for more, reach out to me for a safe place to talk and we'll go on this journey together.

If you just want someone to listen to you as I'm not a therapist but I'm a  good listener and I love you and if I can do it you can do it so let's do it together, brother.

Oh yeah, I titled this "God has a perfect plan"

Last night I went to bed after midnight knowing that today was going to be a rainy day. But for some reason I couldn't be fucked to bring my laundry inside. I thought I would have a few hours before it actually got rainy and perhaps I did because I woke up (sans alarm) at the crack of dawn at 4:47 a.m. 

Having energy to do so, I brought my laundry inside, and noticed one of my shirts had fallen. It was a Beastie Boys shirt (that may be retired soon because) I'm trying to wear nicer clothes to signal to others in my world that I'm not just a kid anymore who's slowly learning not to only wear Snoopy, Nine Inch Nails, and Beastie Boys shirts.

Pretend I'm a man who has his proverbial shit together which I definitely don't always. But anyway I bent down low to pick up that shirt and lo, I noticed hiding underneath the edge of my house was the water bottle that I've been low key looking for for a fair few days and couldn't really find it because it was hiding underneath the outer edge of my apartment and I had no idea it was there. (since I went "camping")

I hadn't written in my journal that I've been looking for my water bottle, but this entry is going straight into my journal now. 

Oh, and speaking of journal, right now my journal is available at its rightful home at https://www.robnugen.com/journal/, which currently refreshes to https://www.robnugen.com/journal/journal.pl (with an extra `journal/` in `/journal/journal.pl`), but that's only because it's 
(res|h)iding inside my Hugo website which doesn't know how to make the cool calendar index and is slow as shit to compile my journal.

In some kind of alchemy, I want to reduce the extra `journal/` directory from the path, but I haven't yet figured out (meaning I haven't given the time to figure out how to do that while the journal resides inside my Hugo website).

Thank you Spirit 🙏 for helping me bring together the disparate parts of my life.  Books, coaching, journal, AB, Marble Track 3.  😊 Let's gooooo!
