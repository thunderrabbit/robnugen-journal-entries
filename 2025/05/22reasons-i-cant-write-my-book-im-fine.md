Reasons I can't write my book I'M FINE:

People won't like it. I don't know how to get it right. It's too confusing. I have bad memory. It's too personal. People will judge me. It will be a waste of time. It won't sell itself. I didn't do it right from the start. I should start over. I hate writing. They'll judge me. I cannot write fancy words. I don't know what to say. They'll know I'm just a hack. I'm just copying other shit I heard. I don't have a degree or license or enough experience. I'm a failure. No one will listen to me. What do I know? The book is too short too long too boring too dry too personal. I'll never get it perfect.
