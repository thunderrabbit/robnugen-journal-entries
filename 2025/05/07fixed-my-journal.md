This morning I pointed Quick to the new directory for my journal:

`~/robnugen.com/journal/journal/`

The first `journal/` is my code written in Perl to do the fancy calendar stuff.

The second `journal/` is the actualy repo with my journal entries and backwards story in the commit messages.

Quick can save new files, but there's been a regression as it cannot commit the changes anymore.  I'm not sure why not.

I don't yet know if Quick can still edit existing entries.  Let's see...

Yes it can!  Yay!
