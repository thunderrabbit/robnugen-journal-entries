Today is the day I'll meet Soness for the first time since her Big In Japan comedy show last year.

I'm looking forward to catching up and enjoying some vegan gluten free yum yums, probably at Ain Soph.

代々木上原駅 (Yoyogi Uehara station) now

It's rainy so I have my umbrella ☔ which I bought last year.  I've been writing the dates on it each day I use it.

I was in a rush so didn't take a photo after I wrote today's date today, but then my neighbor Aika offered me a ride to the station yayyy!

I'm on time but still no photo yet.
