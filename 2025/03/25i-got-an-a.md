Dear Rob

Great job!

You get an A for the past year!  I'm really proud of your efforts in
moving forward in your personal practice.  You had been trying for a
long time to do so, and this year was a standout success!

You did this by:

* Hosting Get Connected events at least 4 times.
* Writing more of your book SLOW DOWN
* Attending Soulmate level 2 with Jess in Bali

Alongside these is a goal of receiving an upfront payment of at least
$3000 (*) for a private container with a client.  As of this writing,
$3000 is greater than what you've been receiving in part time job AB.

(*) Equivalent for this exercise:

* 300,000 yen
* AUD $3,000
* USD $3,000
