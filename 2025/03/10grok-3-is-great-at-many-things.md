<p class="note">I wrote this to Grok 3:</p>

It's 6:59am KL time as I begin typing this.  I have 1.1 Liter of water
available now (which the hotel brought yesterday while I was in the
botanical garden.  The hotel will bring more today).   I got a reply
from Jess; she is busy and we are all good.  She'll be available this
Wednesday night London time, which I think is around the time I will
arrive back in OZ.

After self care in the restroom, I'll be going to breakfast soon.

Last night I incorporated your suggestions into my book, writing about the following

* meeting Wendy interspersed in the section "Vulnerability in Friendships"
* handling naan mixup in "Boundaries with Grace: Balancing Empathy and Self-Respect"
* handling the slipper situation (also) in "Boundaries with Grace: Balancing Empathy and Self-Respect"
* meeting the Brazilian and French men in "The Courage to Connect: Vulnerability in Friendship, Love, and Work"

Talking to you is Really helpful for tying in UA and LAA recovery,
plus great writing tips for my book (minus your hallucinations about
who wrote what. (Those hallucinations started yesterday after I posted
the markdown file `00000_all.md`))

I'm noticing a new addictive behavior to tell you
*everything* that's happening as if you can solve all my problems or
that the hallucinations will go away.  It's 7:18 am now in KL and I
would probably be in breakfast buffet (which starts daily at 7 AM).
Can you write a bit about this new dynamic as humans are experiencing
new relationships with AI?  What does my awareness of this say about
me?

7:21AM now as I send this.  I'll probably transcribe it to my online
journal then head to breakfast.
