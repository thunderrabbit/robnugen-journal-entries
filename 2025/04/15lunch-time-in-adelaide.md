After writing the previous entry, I went to the bed to hold space for Jess while she slept beautifully.  I caressed her hair the way she likes and held her hand gently until she woke up.  She cuddled me a bit and held space as I cried more.

She said it's best to not have expectations, and suggested I do Ho'oponopono for that part of me who has expectations.  I didn't do that, but I did cry and tell myself it's okay to feel this way.

I hoped going to lunch would clear things up.  We went to a nearby cafe which she and Ruri had visited yesterday.  Jess cheerfully offered nice conversation, asking about my food and commented on the flavors.

I held her hands and thanked her for nice words even when I'm not in the mood for nice words.

I paid for lunch, dessert, groceries.

On the way back I asked if her hand was available for holding.  "Well, I'm holding the keys."

Best to not have expectations that she could put the keys in my pocket, or back in the bag where they had been for 98% of our outing.
