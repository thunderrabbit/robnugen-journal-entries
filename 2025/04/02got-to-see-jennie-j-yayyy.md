So great to see Jennie J today!

Hilarious stories spanned decades across Yokohama, Bell Wisteria, London, Adelaide, Perth!  Really funny times and so great to hear about The Crazy Texan, who I hadn't heard of!

Thank you Nugget for taking the photo!

We got to see Jen's apartment and she showed us a nice park from where we can see the bay. A pink Hummer arrived before us, and a bunch of middle schoolers hopped out.  They must have had a great time!

Big hug to Jennie J and looking forward to another visit while we're in Perth!
