<p class="dream">I came into the bar area 15 minutes before the show was scheduled.  No MC was there so I announced myself.  "Hey everyone my name is Rob and I'll be doing stand up in fifteen minutes so I'm going to go think of some jokes."</p>

<p class="dream">That got a laugh.  So far so good.</p>

<p class="dream">Then a young woman came up to me and asked if I'd be running another Cuddle Party.  'Yes; it will be Sunday April 27th from 1pm to 4pm in Crafers.  Would you like to join us?"</p>

<p class="dream">She hugged me closely and our lips were slightly touching as she spoke.  "I cannot attend then, but we're having a Cuddle Party at the" and she proceeded to tell me a place I don't yet know.</p>

I felt excited about the new possible event as I woke up.
