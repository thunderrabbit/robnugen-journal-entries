Today Keith and I went to check out the materials available for the weekend.  Nice to get to know him more and talk about travel.  Neither of us lives in our home country.

Google Maps took us the wrong way at one point but we were able to have a laugh about it later.

Afterward we did a bit of shopping; I forgot the third item Jess asked me to buy: mushies!  Pesto, pasta, mushrooms, yay lunch coming soon!  Thank you, Hunbun!
