If I just focus on the phone screen, it looks basically like a video game.  But when I think "I'm controlling a camera in 3D space," I felt nervous like *omg I hope I don't hit a tree!*

I successfully circled a couple of trees, flew it through his bicycle's frame, through a few Y shaped branches in a small tree.

While I flew it toward a larger tree to explore it, the RTH (Return To Home) activated due to low battery and the drone immediately bonked itself into a tree and crashed.  It's only 185 grams and the props are surrounded by the frame so no damage occurred to the tree.

We laughed a bit and Ryan put it back in its case.  Pretty fun, but not sure if I'll get one.
