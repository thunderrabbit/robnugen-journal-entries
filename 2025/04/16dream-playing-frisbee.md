<p class="dream">In a very large tall grassy field there were some guys playing frisbee with some frisbees that basically looked like big hats that had strange shapes.</p>

<p class="dream">I wasn't sure if they would be open to me playing, but I basically went to get the frisbee and looked up as a way to ask and got no response. So, I picked it up, threw it and it went perfectly to the guy so I was thereby welcomed into their game. They had a blue disc that looked like Indiana Jones hat, but with the crown all the way to one side of the disc. They had a yellow disc with extra curves on the rim.</p>

<p class="dream">I threw the yellow disc while they weren't looking and it got lost in some bushes so I went over to where it landed but I couldn't find it. I said "the yellow desk is over here" and then one of the guys immediately found it. I was surprised because I didn't see it in the same area.</p>

<p class="dream">One of the guys was standing in a concrete doorway and I threw the blue disc which got lodged up in the upper left corner of the doorway.  I think he could have reached it by jumping, but his friend lifted him up on his shoulders and then the guy bumped it out of the corner with his head.</p>

<p class="dream">After retrieving the blue disc, one guy said, "if you don't break it, we're going to leave this disc here."</p>

<p class="dream">I asked if it was due to its weird shape and they agreed.</p>

<p class="dream">I was surprised because I thought it was a fine disc with just a bit of a strange shape and throw.  They apparently experimented with it today and chose not to keep using it.</p>
