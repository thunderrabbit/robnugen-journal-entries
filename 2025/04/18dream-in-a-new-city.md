<p class="dream">In a new city Jess and I were jogging toward the botanical Gardens. She went left around a school and I continued going directly through the school building because it was a more direct route to the garden.</p>

<p class="dream">Inside the school building were lots of students and I tried asking them if I was heading the correct direction.</p>

<p class="dream">Climbing inside a large construction site, I was discovering empty rooms in a large 3D maze of buildings.</p>

<p class="dream">I was standing with some of my peeps next to a food truck when Jeff called and asked me if I could bring him a sandwich.  I asked what kind he wanted and he said "anything" so I headed to the back of the school to go up and realized I was going up the wrong building but I knew they were connected at the lower levels so I went to the uppermost connected level, into the building toward the front, and then turned right to go into the correct tower.</p>

<p class="dream">Lots of people were in the building which offered a nice view of the fields below.  I found some gummy bear crackers that could fly in circles if thrown like a boomerang.</p>

<p class="dream">I threw a few and could even get a cracker to fly two loops before I caught it again.  The loops got smaller each time so I would just walk forward a bit to catch them after three or up to about five loops, at which point the cracker would have ended up flat and drift spinning straight down like a maple seed.</p>
