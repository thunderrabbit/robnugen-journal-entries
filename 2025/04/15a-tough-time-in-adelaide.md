Amazingly(?), I'm having a tough time in Adelaide with Jess.

Last night upon arrival from Perth, I paid for a taxi to quickly go where we'll be staying.  Great time talking with the taxi driver and even exchanged numbers on WhatsApp.   She greeted me and showed our room where I put my bags.  I asked for a hug and she demurred, saying we can hug after I have a shower.  Ummm okay, so I took a shower, imagining there were actually two people; one who greeted me, and then I'll get to see Jess after my shower.

I finished my shower and ended up sitting on the corner of the bed ostensibly in meditation and to ground myself; releasing expectation for physical contact.

Jess came in and I asked for hug.  She gave me one, saying she had wanted to protect her energy from anything I may have picked up while traveling, so had me shower first.

At the dining room table, I shared about my weekend while Jess wrote notes on what looked like scratch paper she uses for to do lists.

Jess shared some of her recent wins, after which I offered to give her a kiss as a celebration.  She said, "it sounds like you want a kiss.." and gave me three kisses: two on the forehead and one on the lips.

She helped me soak my left foot which has a stubborn skin condition, and then I headed off to sleep.

I woke up early and pet the cat who was meowing for attention.  He had dry food in the bowl so I just pet him a bit.

Jess got up later and gave wet food then showed me how to clean one of the litter boxes.  I took the lid off the other to help her clean it and Jess said, "you don't do it that way."

Instead of escalating, "yes I do!" I left the room, while she said, "you turn it like this."  I didn't have the capacity to watch Jess's suggested way of rotating a cat box.

I walked away wondering what the heck happened.  I was trying to be of service and received unexpected (unwanted) correction on how to access a cat litter box.  I've had cats for far(!) longer than Jess, so I think I can handle cleaning litter.

After she finished with the litter, Jess came into where I was standing, facing out the window.  I tried to explain why I did it my way (defending myself).  She escalated self defense with "you don't have to take the lid off.  The owner even showed me, but you just walked away," and I just cried.  "I'm leaving," I thought, and went to pack my things, crying, sobbing into my clean laundry (which I washed yesterday in Perth).

Jess came in and I imagined she might be holding space for me, so I looked up to face her so we can put this behind us.   But she was sleeping so I left her and wrote this as a catharsis.
