<p class="dream">I was skating on a highway in the city and Jess wanted to come with me so I had her sit on my lap as I sat on the skateboard and I used her shoes to touch the pavement as necessary to help us turn one direction or another and add stability. So we were able to flow down one highway hill and then back up another at least one full time and navigated through some other skateboarders until we got to a part of the highway that was under construction. So we went through the construction zone until we got to some stairs and we had to get off the skateboard at that point.</p>

<p class="dream">I went down the stairs a little bit and saw some construction workers down there so I held still so they wouldn't see me and then went down the stairs where I got to see all of their equipment that was in this workshop and I went through the next door which had hanging plastic strips to allow humans easy access but to keep air conditioning on one side of the door. I made sure to close the plastic carefully which took extra time and someone saw me so after I went back up the other stairs a security guard came up behind me and holding a gun so I realized it was a dream.  He said "stop right there; get on the ground."  I said "it's okay" and woke up.</p>
