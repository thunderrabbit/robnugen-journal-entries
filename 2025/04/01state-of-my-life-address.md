1. Jess and I are house sitting Milo the greyhound in Bateman, a suburb of Perth.
2. I'm the MOS coordinator for the NWTA weekend training coming soon!
3. I enjoyed attending North Perth Integration Group last night.  Lloyd drove me there from Bateman.  11 men were in the meeting.  One of my mates from 8 years ago was like, "I can't believe I'm seeing you face to face; where did the time go?"
4. We got to see Jennie J while hanging out in Freo (Fremantle) last week.
5. I've been playing with AI, and just got Plandex 2 installed on my Lemur laptop
6. I wrote to the author of a dream journal software (project that got abandoned because it was too complex) because I still want dream journal.
7. I am considering using Plandex 2 to tweak Quick to allow dream entries.
8. Quick is the software that I wrote to replace Quill to work for PHP 8+ and write journal entries to my journal
9. It now also looks up the next word in my backwards story to use as the commit message.  https://bitbucket.org/thunderrabbit/robnugen-journal-entries/commits/branch/master  (as of now it says "Millenium House was so much fun ...")
10. Jess and I had a nice walk in the park while walking Milo.  Then we walked to the local IGA.
11. I've finished more than half of this Australian adventure Q1 2025
12. I liked the manager of Hougoumont Hotel; he was friendly and very positive!
13. I've got AB web server on Ubuntu 22 running PHP 8.1.  Almost caught up to latest Ubuntu 24 (I think) and PHP 8.3 Yay!
14. The image server still needs to be upgraded.  I gotta talk to Nate about that.
15. This morning I woke up crying from a dream which I just posted from my phone but haven't cleaned up yet.
16. Now it says ("nicely. Millenium House was so much fun ...")
17. Nina killed herself in Thailand.  I'm sad she didn't reach out to me, though I also didn't reach out to her, but I did leave her nice notes in her luggage when we met in Nagano.
18. I've been working on my book which was Book One, then a whole monster of four or five parts, but now is Book One again.  Almost done coming through it to prepare for professional editor.
19. Tomorrow I'll meet Karen Langston for our weekly book writing accountability call.
20. Tonight, I'm gonna shave, too.
21. I used a ChatGPT I called Dr Defi to write a script to look up the price of SOL every 5 minutes.  It's working nicely!  Draws a graph and everything.
22. I've been telling people I'm going to start closing up shop in Japan.  When I get there though, I dunno how quickly that will happen.
23. I can now edit journal entries on Quick! (^-^)V  yayyyyy!
