<p class="dream">After walking down a flight of stairs that led nowhere, one of the women from acroyoga climbed onto me to give a big front-facing hug and thanked me for supporting her and helping her come to a better relationship with her partner.</p>

<p class="dream">I told her and Miyako P the story about me and Jess from a couple days ago, with some details that I couldn't remember well.</p>

I would say the details I couldn't remember well are those that didn't happen in real life.

<p class="dream">At one point Miyako asked, "but how did you get through it all?"</p>

<p class="dream">And I said "I'm just about to get to that part."</p>

And I woke up in physical reality.
