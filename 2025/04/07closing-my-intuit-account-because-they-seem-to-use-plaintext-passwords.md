[![2025 apr 07 intuit dot com pissing me off 1000](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2025/thumbs/2025_apr_07_intuit_dot_com_pissing_me_off.png)](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2025/2025_apr_07_intuit_dot_com_pissing_me_off_1000.png)

It all started when I received an email alert that someone was trying to log into my account at 00:08 AM last night.  

Fuck.  They must be using compromised credentials.  APPARENTLY INTUIT DIDN'T DISABLE ALL BREACHED PASSWORDS AFTER THEY GOT HACKED

I saw they offered a way to report it.

"If you didn't make this request, [contact us.](#simulated-link)"

The "contact us" bit had a long-ass link with enough identifiers to prove exactly what I was reporting.  But click that link dumped me on a generic contact page.  fffs.

I logged in easily enough because Intuit didn't disable breached passwords.

I then tried to change my password.

Here are the stated requirements:

* 8 or more characters
* Upper and lower case letters (e.g. Aa)
* A number (e.g. 1234)
* A symbol (e.g. !@#$)

So here is what I tried:

```

```

Seems strong enough! It's even described as STRONG

Intuit rejected it with a vague message: “Invalid password.” No explanation. I tried 64 characters. Then 53. Finally, they accepted a password with just about 30 characters.

[![2025 apr 07 intuit invalid password 1000](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2025/thumbs/2025_apr_07_intuit_invalid_password.png)](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2025/2025_apr_07_intuit_invalid_password_1000.png)

Is Intuit still saving passwords in plaintext??

How do I close my account???
