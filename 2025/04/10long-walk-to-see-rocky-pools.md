Yesterday Jess and I took an allegedly 34 minute walk to see Rocky Pools, a swimming hole near here. Before we got very far, we learned there is no water in them.  That's good to know!

The 34 minute walk must believe the road is flat and smooth, but our experience was lots of dangerous bits with gravel beads on smooth stone which could easily allow for an uncontrolled slipperoo, bruised bum, and scraped up hands.  Fortunately we were super careful and made it to the Rocky Pools easily enough.

We didn't see any kangaroos, but we saw some kangaroo's poos.  Close enough.

We did see some fire-scorched trees along the way.  The undergrowth had all grown back so it must be at least a season since the fires.

We decided *not* to go back up the way we had come down, so we walked a much smoother longer route out, taking about 2 hours I guess.  Along the way we saw some black cockatoos!  Wow I had never previously heard of such!

Back home gratefully safely with a bit of headache from lack of hydration.  ooopsy. Gotta have (more) water when bush walking!
