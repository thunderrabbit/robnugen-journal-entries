It's been approximately twenty-two years since I ended up ending
things with j and to be honest, I'm still not over the loss of the
incredible connection we had.  Why did it have to be this way?

In related, news, I have been manually reverting my old journal
entries in my markdown journal (powered by Hugo) *back* into HTML
entries for use in my older journal (powered by pure perl) which
couldn't, but now can, parse markdown.

Parsing that sentence, I can find some issues, but the main issue with
my Perl journal not parsing markdown has been solved enough that even
if I cannot keep all the URLs working the way I hoped, Imma go back to
using my Perl journal at `/journal`.  That means the new perl powered
URL mightttt end up being https://www.robnugen.com/journal.pl instead
of https://www.robnugen.com/journal/ but that's okay with me because I
love love love the calendar, That Guy love(s|d) the calendar, and it's
so much better with the calendar.  Plus, it's meant for humans, not
bots, so I only write it for present Rob, future Rob and my forever
fans.

I love you guys and am so grateful for our connection.
