<p class="dream">I went to dinner with some of my friends for our mutual birthdays and  all decided to write down desired birthday gifts on the back of a piece of paper.  I transcribed the first gift that someone mentioned and then the second gift was something that I didn't understand so I asked him to write it.  Instead of what he wanted, he wrote down what he didn't want and told me the other person will understand what he does want.</p>

<p class="dream">I just wrote simply "lunch" because that's what I was already enjoying with them.</p>

<p class="dream">After coming down some stairs into a room with water flowing and then cascading down a waterfall, I was standing on a log with someone with the idea that we could go down the waterfall while on it, but it just looked too scary and foolish to try such a thing but apparently many people had done it before.</p>

<p class="dream">The water flow was preceded by some very mucky water that was kind of gross and muddy and I ended up stepping in that mucky water and getting my bed sheet a little bit dirty with that water and so I put the bed sheet into the nearby flow of clean water and some YRUU youth were grateful for the sheet because it kept them warm and comfortable in the water.</p>

<p class="dream">I needed the bed sheet to act as a pillow so I rolled it up and tried to put it behind my head but my hat kept blocking me from putting the sheet behind my head because I couldn't lift my neck far enough to make the brim of the hat come off the ground where I could put the sheet under my neck.</p>

<p class="dream">Once I realized what was happening and knowing what I wanted, I made an extra effort and I was able to get the sheet under my neck as a pillow.</p>
