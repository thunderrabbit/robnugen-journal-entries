One of the staff men at the NWTA said I can sleep at his place if I'm
okay with an air mattress.

The house was amazing, with modern floating stairs leading up to a
balcony bridge inside which connected bedrooms on either end of the
house.

With his family and two other guests, we enjoyed making pizzas and
prepping them in the pizza oven (2 minutes per pizza) which helped us
connect over various preferences and sharing the workload.  I made a
pizza featuring trail mix, apples, and bananas.  It was great!

I watched a construction process the next morning, digging trenches
for waste water plumbing and preparation to grade the surface with
sand.

I enjoyed using this literal vision of construction represent
construction of a new house for me and Hunbun.

Alas, I had to head out toward the airport for my flight to Adelaide
to see Hunbun in Glenelg, our preferred neighborhood in Adelaide, our
preferred city in OZ.
