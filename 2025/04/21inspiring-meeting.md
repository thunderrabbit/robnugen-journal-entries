Thank you men for great MKP Parklands meeting last night.  I was glad to be on the couch team and selected to help facilitate.  Great piece of work and  I'm glad my idea to switch places with the glass mirror helped unlock something.

Thank you men for the ride and inspiration to finish my next draft this week!  I'M FINE v5 coming soon to a computer near me!
