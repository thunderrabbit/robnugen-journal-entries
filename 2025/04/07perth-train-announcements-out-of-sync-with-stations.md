Yesterday Jess and I left (Milo in) Bateman and came out to Gooseberry Hills

We had to change trains in Perth underground and we were getting off the train when I heard the announcement say it was Elizabeth Quay.

"Jess wait!  This is the wrong station!"  I called to her as she got off the train. 

She was confused and we got back on the train but then a guy on the train asked " do you want to get off in Perth Underground?"

"Yes."

"This is Perth Underground.'

"But the announcement was Elizabeth Quay."

He nodded his head and shrugged like _yep_

We got back off the train as Jess thanked the man for helping us out.

To satisfy my confused brain, I found this posted several months ago:

I tried to post this one on the same group but it wasn't accepted.
