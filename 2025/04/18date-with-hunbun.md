Today Jess and I went shopping and discovered nearly all the shops are closed on Easter Friday! 🐰 

Close to the beach more things were open and we were able to get a great Indian vegan samosa and pakora which we ate at the beach. 

I saw a pigeon with some fishing line stuck to his foot but I couldn't do anything to help him because I'm sure it would take a net to catch him, plus gloves, and possibly scissors  to safely remove the fishing line. 

I made a football shaped triangle out of the bag and tried to toss it into the trash can but it didn't make it in.

Jess wanted me to get up and put it in the trash can but I decided to throw it in, just for the experience.

I missed, but just barely!

We got some tea at a tea place, where I lamented not asking for "no ice" because they specifically have "no ice" as an option.

We stayed until the place was overrun with teens, one of whom wore fuzzy pajama bottoms... Reminds me of YRUU!
