<p class="dream">I walked along the street and then turned left into a parking lot where there was some buses and I had to check to see which way the bus was trying to go so I could go the other direction while they was trying to park. Then a woman came out to me and I realized it was a bus driver asking if I wanted to take the bus to the beach and I said actually yes but I didn't know which stop. So I went inside the building to find out which stop and saw my mom there holding a sign that had some initials as if she was waiting for someone and that someone was me. Then I said hi to Ma and my aunt started speaking Japanese to the bus driver to find out if we could get to the particular stop. I was surprised my aunt could speak Japanese but then  I realized it wasn't my aunt but someone else possibly my niece.  The bus driver got out her list of bus stops and said this was the stop and it was only two stops away which was surprising. But then I realized that each line represented multiple bus stops because bus stop name would only be a word or a couple of words. But each line head like five or seven words in it.</p>
