<p class="dream">The family car had a vendor bender and I didn't have time at first to reinstall the new back bumper. So I had put the new back bumper inside the trunk of the car.</p>

<p class="dream">When I had time to reinstall, the new bumper was facing the back of the car and opened the trunk and saw a large piece of paper with a small wing nut on top.  I knew that Wing nut must be for something so I should keep it. But then I realized I had to poop so I wanted to go do that first before I started to get everything out of the trunk.</p>

I woke up, but I only had to pee not poo.
