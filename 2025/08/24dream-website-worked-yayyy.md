I’m glad that my dream capturing website is working pretty well for an MVP. 

I need to make a few changes, including 

1. not including this entry as a dream even though it has “dream” in its title, because it is not include any paragraph tags with the class dream or lucid. 

2. Add a few common tags like PB

3. Create some keyword merges like “my brother” equals Fred
