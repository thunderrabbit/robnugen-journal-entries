<p class="dream">Playing ball with some strangers in a large field I was practicing throwing long-distance underhand throws and at the same time they were playing something of a scrimmage by pitching and hitting the softball.</p>

<p class="dream">I was throwing them maybe 50 yards and the other players could usually catch them but I was having trouble catching their return throws.</p>

<p class="dream">As the field got more crowded, things got more dangerous and one of my throws bounced and then hit a young kid in the chin.</p>

<p class="dream">I zipped over to him to check if he was okay.  Fortunately, he wasn’t bleeding but he said it hurt.</p>

 I woke up while apologizing to him.
