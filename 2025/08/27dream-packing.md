<p class="dream">After being on vacation for a couple of weeks we were trying to pack and finish up everything before having to leave.  I was trying to figure out which stuff to leave for Lin and what stuff should go in my bags.</p>

<p class="dream">I was working alone in the process and found curious things like a pool noodle which definitely would not fit in my bag.</p>

<p class="dream">I was feeling some level of stress or unclear about the best way to finish, and wanting to be able to discuss it with someone.</p>
