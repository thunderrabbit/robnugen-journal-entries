I've been focusing on drinking lots of liquids on Sundays.  I bought four 900ml juices cartons and 900ml Pocari Sweat bottle so I can pour the unfinished juice into the plastic resealable bottle.

Bootcamp runs from 10am to noon.
Then ultimate 🥏 from 1pm to 4pm I think.

I'm grateful for cracking my clavicle this morning so I know how much pressure it can withstand!
