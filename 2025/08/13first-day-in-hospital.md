I checked in to the hospital today to get the titanium plate removed from my shoulder.  It's been there for 19 years, so it's time for it to move out to its own home.

### 14:57

A few nurses have come by to check my vitals and my awareness: 
"what's your full name?" 
"where on your body will the surgery be?"

I've been asked twice so far, and the second time I asked why she's asking.  She said it's to double check, and they'll ask me again tomorrow before and after surgery (I think)

The most recent nurse asked me if I have any questions.  "Hai~ Can y'all take photos for me during the surgery?" 

She was like "???" so I showed her the photos from when I got the plate inserted.  She said she'll ask the doctor.  I'm optimistic!

Yayyy!!  My original surgeon will be doing the surgery tomorrow.  He came by and said hello and that he'll have them take photos for me.  I'm so happy!
