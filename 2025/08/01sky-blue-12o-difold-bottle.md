I just received my 12oz bottles via Kickstarter; congratulations and gratitude to the team for following through with the design, production, shipping, and all those challenges.

I noticed inside the bottle of has the volume indicators. Nice 🙂.  

Oh interesting: 8oz and 12o (not 12oz).  Intentional?  🤔
