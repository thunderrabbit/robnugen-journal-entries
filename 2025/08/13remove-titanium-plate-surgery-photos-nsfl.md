It took the nurse a while to decide where to insert this IV.  She checked my arm for a while then went with the back of my hand.

Curious about the drip chamber, I turned it sideways, inadvertently sending an air bubble down the tube.  Oops!  I went to the nursing station and one of the nurses flicked the tube to *sort* it out.

The most unexpected part: 
The anaesthesiologist said in Japanese "okay, I'm beginning to inject the medicine.." 薬始まります (or something), I thought "okay, I wonder when.. "  and then the surgery was done!  

There didn't seem to be any passage of time.  It was weird amazing 😳 

But apparently they did it!

I took a couple of photos once I got back to my room.

One of the nurses elevated my lower arm, so it was hard to use my phone.  I guess I should sleep.

I couldn't sleep at first, but I rested without falling asleep and then I noticed the sound from the oxygen tube stopped for a second then came back on. 

It's coming from a supply in the wall, so I'm 99.99% sure it was my ears falling asleep for little micro naps.

Consciousness is fascinating!
