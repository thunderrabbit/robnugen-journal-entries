Hello Good As Usual 

I saw your post about how you became a man, and wanted to confirm if you wrote it, and if I can quote you in my book I'm writing about emotional awareness for men.   

Here's your quote 
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/s/jShFUkO3UR

One of my chapters is about initiation rites, and the lack of them in my culture.

Questions or Turing test is welcome to prove I'm human.  ;-) 

Blessings
 - Rob
