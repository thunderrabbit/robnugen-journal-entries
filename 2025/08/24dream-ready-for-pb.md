<p class="dream">I was on public transit with other passengers and we turned to the left at Shin Yurigaoka Station so that we faced the ocean. During the turn I noticed my woman friend standing facing away from the bus in a perfectly aligned photo but I missed the chance to take the photo. I thought about running back to get it but I didn’t want to risk missing my public transit.</p>

<p class="dream">I was excited to see the ship, so I jumped off the bus and flew ahead, basically Skating along the street down to get to the ocean then turning left and then left again where the harbor was.</p>

<p class="dream">I was excited to see the shape of the cruise ship standing hugely above me and then realized that it was a different ship.</p>

<p class="dream">Skating along the sidewalk I could see it slowly sunk down into the water ahead of me, so I stopped before I got to that point.</p>

<p class="dream">The other ship was gone and I looked around to see but didn’t find anyone else.</p>
