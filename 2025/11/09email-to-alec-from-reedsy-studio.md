Hi Alec

My first book has been published! https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FYNH5WNC  

I'M FINE! invites men to begin their inner journey exploring the emotions within.  It shows how being in touch with emotions makes life better.  Don't buy it yet unless you want a rare First Printing with errors!  There's a second printing coming soon which fixes the errors and allows each copy of the book to have a unique life of its own.

My second book is yet untitled, but the concept continues with the inner exploration of emotions and how emotional awareness enables more authentic relationships, making *relationships* better.

My third book talks about how these emotions are coming from a source greater than us, guiding us toward goodness in our lives, and how letting go of the attempt to control everything allows things to flow more smoothly.   This third book will bring in some science that basically notices similarities between quantum physics and esoteric knowledge of spirit and stuff behind the scenes of physicality.

My fourth book in the series says yes AI is coming inexorably, but it's good to retain connection with pure consciousness instead of filtered through the machine, regardless of how fancy it looks.  There's no better connection to consciousness than the quantum computer in which you reside (a.k.a. your physical body).

Thank you Alec for your offer to bring resources to this project! Just by articulating the above, I'm better able to focus on the way forward.

    - Rob!
