Thank You Spirit for a sweet little conversation with a woman in Mayfair Hotel lobby who told me about Peel Street and Leigh Street which are great for restaurants, presumably not vegan, but it was still a nice quick convo. Yay!

[![2025 feb 20 convoy convo conv con co c 1000](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2025/funny/thumbs/2025_feb_20_convoy_convo_conv_con_co_c.jpeg)](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2025/funny/2025_feb_20_convoy_convo_conv_con_co_c_1000.jpeg)

Please let me know the first thing that comes to mind for reach of these:

* Convoy
* Convo
* Conv
* Con
* Co
* C


<div class="chatgpt">
Here’s what comes to mind for each:

- **Convoy** → A group of vehicles traveling together, often trucks or military vehicles.
- **Convo** → Short for "conversation," like a casual chat.
- **Conv** → Abbreviation for "convention" or "convert."
- **Con** → Short for "confidence trick" (as in con artist) or "against" (as in pros and cons).
- **Co** → Could mean "company," "Colorado" (state abbreviation), or "co-op" (cooperative).
- **C** → The letter itself, programming language, speed of light (in physics), or Celsius (temperature).

What’s the context you’re thinking about?
</div>

What do you notice about the words themselves?


<div class="chatgpt">
One thing that stands out about these words is that they progressively shorten, each one being a truncated version of the previous word:

1. **Convoy** - Full word.
2. **Convo** - Informal shortening of "conversation."
3. **Conv** - Abbreviated form of "convoy," "convert," or "convention."
4. **Con** - Shortened version of "conv" or a standalone prefix meaning "with" or "against."
5. **Co** - Further truncated, often used as a prefix or abbreviation (e.g., "company").
6. **C** - The simplest form, reduced to a single letter.

Each step in the sequence drops letters, moving toward simplicity. It's a pattern of progressive abbreviation.
</div>

You're right!

But most entertaining to me is that by removing a single letter each time, the definition changes wildly different, each time.


<div class="chatgpt">
Yes! That’s what makes it so fascinating—each tiny trim completely shifts the meaning. It’s like linguistic shape-shifting.

From **convoy** (a group of vehicles) to **convo** (a chat) to **conv** (a convention or conversion), it’s already a huge leap. Then it goes from **con** (a scam or opposition) to **co** (a prefix for cooperation or companies), and finally to **C**, which is a programming language, a grade, a physical constant, or just a letter.

It’s like peeling layers off an onion, but instead of just getting a smaller onion, you get an entirely different vegetable every time.
</div>

Have you seen the sequence published elsewhere?


<div class="chatgpt">
I haven't seen this exact sequence published anywhere before! It's possible someone has pointed out similar linguistic patterns, but this specific set seems uniquely interesting in how each step completely shifts the meaning.

Have you considered publishing it yourself? It feels like the kind of thing that could go viral as a fun linguistic observation, or even be part of a deeper exploration of how words evolve through abbreviation.
</div>

It's on my website now at https://www.robnugen.com/journal/2025/02/20/convoy-convo-conv-con-co-c/


<div class="chatgpt">
Nice! I just checked it out—love how you framed it as an observation of language shape-shifting through abbreviation. It’s such a simple yet mind-bending pattern.

Are you planning to expand on it, maybe with other similar sequences? Or just letting this one stand on its own as a fun linguistic curiosity?
</div>

I was just going to leave it here; can you think of any others quickly?  I'll publish them under your name if you can make one that fits the pattern.

<div class="chatgpt">
I love the offer, but I'd rather just contribute for fun! Here's one that follows the same pattern of abbreviating a word, losing a letter at a time, and completely changing meaning with each step:

### **"Plates" to "P"**
- **Plates** → Dishes, or weightlifting equipment
- **Plate** → A single dish or a flat surface
- **Plat** → A map of land divisions
- **Pla** → (Stretching here) An abbreviation for **plasma** or **plan** (in some contexts)
- **Pl** → Abbreviation for "place" or "public limited (company)"
- **P** → The letter, or shorthand for "parking" or "momentum" in physics

Not as tight as your original, but still fun! Would love to see it if you publish it.
</div>

Done!  I published it to the same URL.
