I'm procrastinating writing my book and found a cute distraction.

I read Gary Larson's book *There's a HAIR in my dirt!*

[![2025 oct 14 it should be releasing the toad 1000](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2025/thumbs/2025_oct_14_it_should_be_releasing_the_toad.jpeg)](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2025/2025_oct_14_it_should_be_releasing_the_toad_1000.jpeg)

Funny enough, there is an error in the pictured page of his book because a couple pages previous, we learned the frog is actually a toad.

So, dear me, it's okay to write my first book and get it done, not *perfect*.
