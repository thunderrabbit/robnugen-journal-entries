I finished writing my book a few days ago and sent it to my guy Inam
to get it formatted.  The first version had an error (my mistake); the
second version had an error (his mistake), so I'm looking forward to
getting the source and producing my own PDF and epub if possible.

### 15:00 or so

I ended up not being able to edit it locally; I don't have the correct
software to even edit the .doc file (and keep the page numbers working
correctly) nor the software to convert from the .doc format to .pdf
for the paperback and .epub for the Kindle version.

So Inam did it all and I'm grateful for his support!
