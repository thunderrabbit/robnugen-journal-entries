Yesterday Jeremy picked me up at T2 in Perth.

Chris from Perth who I know from 8 years ago lives nearby so he came over at 7pm when we had curry, rice, deep fried shredded onion, and roti.

We watched cricket last night (I learned a lot as I knew nearly nothing about the game before.)

Chris and I are both in IT so we had a shared topic as opposed to cricket 😂

It's 6:30am here now; I did meditation and ate granola and oat milk Jeremy bought for me last night 😄

Last night I slept well with a heater in the room.  
I enjoyed taking a shower with lots of hot water and water pressure!
