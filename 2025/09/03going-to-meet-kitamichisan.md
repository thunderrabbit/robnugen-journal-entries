In Malaysia I met a Japanese couple from Yamanashi who came to visit me and Marble Track 3 at my apartment.

They asked if I'd be interested in meeting their, um, spiritual person named Kitamichi.

Ummm, yes(?) sure yes I'd be honored! 

My friend said: 

<p class="note">If you participate, it will be a "soul exchange meeting" where you will ask him questions and he will answer them. His assistant will interpret for you. I will pay for the expenses as a memento of your stay in Japan.</p>

Wow, so they're covering the cost to meet him and the cost of an interpreter, so I'm grateful and cautious because it seems almost too good to be legit..

I asked an LLM if it had heard of this guy, but it seems LLM hasn't and everything seems okay.  Anyway here's the guy's website.

We're meeting at Meguro Station West exit today.  Yay for all good things! 🤞
