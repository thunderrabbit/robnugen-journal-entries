During the meeting Kitamichi-san was talking basically non-stop and repeating himself to sick a degree that it made me think he must be nervous. 

Then at the very end, when we got up to take a picture,
I ended up standing in the middle of three of us.

Before the photo could be taken,
Kitamichi-san specifically asked my friend to 
move so Kitamichi-san was in the middle.
