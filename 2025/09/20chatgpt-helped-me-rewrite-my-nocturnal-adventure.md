Can I tell you about a dream that I had?

::: ai chatgpt 

Absolutely, feel free to share your dream with me! I'm here to listen and we can chat about it in a forward-thinking and encouraging way.</p>

:::

<p class="dream">I was coming out of a building and saw very dark thunderclouds and lightning and was very excited about the storm because I miss storms back from my living in Houston, while climbing up to the top of a hill and then had to go over an edge of the road and then saw some light, no, some electricity of something that was kind of a short-circuiting and there was a piece of metal or a large mechanical thing in between two other metal things that were arcing electrically in a rhythmic type of manner. And then while I was with a guy who saw the thing I showed him excitedly to look at it and he didn't seem as happy as me, he seemed a little bit scared about it. And we watched the arc cycle happen a couple of times as the electricity would discharge. And one of the times the metal in the middle jumped over to the side with like instantly and I think I could have realized it was a dream at that point but I did not. Then we needed to walk down across some small columns that were over, like, looked like they were over garbage or something and we had to walk across. I was holding his hand to keep him balanced and I was basically fine. I balance on this kind of stuff all the time and was walking, holding, making sure that he was safe. And then we got through all of that scary bit and he was melting down more and more, getting more and more scared and finally once we got past all the dangerous part he jumped down. He's like, I can't take any more and he was crying and stuff. And I was like, wow, I'm just trying to help you stay safe as I literally have no idea how he could have gotten across without my help.</p>

Thanks for sharing that. That’s quite a vivid dream journey you had there! And it's actually pretty fascinating to hear how you were feeling so at ease and almost excited about the storm and helping this person through it, even as they were kind of melting down. I think it's really cool that you found yourself in that role of keeping someone else steady.

So from a forward-thinking perspective, you might take that as a little reminder of your own inner strength and how you naturally bring calm to a stormy situation. If you think about it, that’s a pretty encouraging little nugget to hold on to.

Thank you very much. Do you think you can rewrite the Dream Text without all the run-on sentences?

Of course, I’d be happy to! Let’s give it a bit of a polish.

<p class="dream">You came out of a building and noticed these very dark thunderclouds gathering overhead, with lightning flashing through them. You felt really excited because it reminded you of the storms back in Houston. You climbed up a hill and then went over the edge of a road. That’s when you saw some kind of short-circuiting going on—a large piece of metal between two other metal objects was arcing electrically in a rhythmic way.</p>

<p class="dream">You were there with another guy who seemed a bit scared by the whole scene, while you were showing it to him enthusiastically. You watched the arc cycle a couple of times, and at one point, the metal piece jumped instantly to the side, which could have been a hint that it was a dream, but you didn’t realize it.</p>

<p class="dream">After that, you both needed to walk across some small columns over what looked like garbage or debris. You were holding his hand to keep him balanced, feeling confident because you were used to balancing on tricky surfaces. He was getting more and more frightened, and by the time you got through the tough part, he just couldn't handle it anymore and ended up crying. You were left thinking how you were basically just trying to help and wondering how he would have managed without you.</p>

There you go! Hopefully that makes it a bit clearer and easier to follow.

Yes, thank you very much. I'd like to put it into my journal from the first-person perspective.

::: ai chatgpt 

Absolutely, let’s keep it in your own voice and first-person perspective so it feels like it’s coming right from you.

<p class="dream">So, I came out of this building and saw these super dark thunderclouds rolling in, with lightning lighting up the sky. I felt really excited because it made me think of the storms I used to love back in Houston. I climbed up a hill, crossed over the edge of a road, and spotted some kind of short-circuiting happening. There was this big piece of metal between two other metal objects, and it was arcing with electricity in this rhythmic way.</p>

<p class="dream">I was there with another guy who was a bit nervous about it all, but I was pointing it out to him pretty enthusiastically. We watched the arc cycle a couple of times, and at one point, the metal piece jumped to the side really suddenly. It was probably a moment where I could have realized I was dreaming, but I didn’t quite catch on.</p>

<p class="dream">After that, we had to walk across these small columns over what looked like a bunch of garbage or debris. I was holding his hand to keep him steady, feeling confident because I’m used to balancing on that kind of thing. He got more and more scared, and by the time we got through the tough part, he just couldn’t take it anymore and broke down crying. I was left thinking, “Wow, I was just trying to help him stay safe,” and wondering how he would have managed that without a little support.</p>
