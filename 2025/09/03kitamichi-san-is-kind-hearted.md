Kitamichi-san in Meguro is kind hearted and didn't try to sell me on anything.

He basically just said "follow your heart" over and over in different ways.

He said he began his recovery by asking Y/N questions of his heart instead of his head, thousands of times each day for four years.

I'm inspired to do more automatic writing.
