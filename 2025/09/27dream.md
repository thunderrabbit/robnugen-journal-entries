<p class="dream">In my apartment a little girl and some guy rode bicycles into my room up on the second floor which was really surprising for me because it was clear they were in my area and couldn't easily get there by bicycle without coming through the door and up the stairs.</p>

<p class="dream">When I went to Bootcamp, Justin was there and was leading everyone  to karaoke instead because of the weather but the day looked fine to me. So I didn't join them because I just wanted to work out and play ultimate.</p>

<p class="dream">Standing at the top of the deck of a ship. There was a long staircase with a slide down the middle and the Navy guys accidentally let a round manhole cover slide down the ramp which tripped a lot of people unless they could jump out of the way and some people jumped off the ship into the forest below.</p>

<p class="dream">The device they were using was some kind of mysterious clear plastic box. We didn't know its use but there were plenty of theories about it being used for teleportation or time travel.</p>

<p class="dream">Then I saw a video of two 70's looking disco black guys planning to inhale the entire box of vapor.  One was filling each tooth around the outside of the box with liquid that would be vaporized while the other was doing interviews about his plan to inhale the entire thing.</p>
