<p class="dream">After having traveled back a long way by train, I got off the train and then realized I had left my bags back at the location.</p>

<p class="dream">I wandered around the train station a bit but eventually forgot about the bang and met my old friend Meredith who seemed to have just had her own letdown so she was hanging out with me and being flirtatious.</p>

<p class="dream">She offered to take me to a cafe but I could tell none of the food was vegan. So I asked the guy behind the counter if they had vegan options but they did not.</p>

<p class="dream">I apologized to Meredith that she couldn't take me out, but we kept walking around the area and eventually met my dad and his wife Karen plus my friend Yuki.</p>

<p class="dream">At one point I was sitting on the edge of a bed, with Meredith on my right, Yuki laying down on my left.  I had my left hand on Yuki's stomach and my right hand on Meredith's left thigh.</p>

<p class="dream">We were in a car driving somewhere and my dad some caterpillar that was in the middle of becoming a chrysalis.  Meredith thought it would be funny if I ate it so she was trying to make me eat it and I utterly refused, feeling really righteous and blocking her from feeding me the chrysalis, plus blowing out through my mouth, but eventually my breath ran out of my lungs </p>
and I woke up.
