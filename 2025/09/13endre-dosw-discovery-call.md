During my first call with Endre, he asked some good questions and helped me feel safe enough to cry about some recent abandonments that have happened in my life (Joe, who was gonna write a foreword, and Paul, who was going to  help edit my book)

After the call, I did my dishes, which have been waiting to be done for weeks.

I appreciated that Endre offered 30 more minutes than we originally scheduled.

I'll see him again in a week and then every two weeks on Saturdays.
