<p class="dream">Last night I had a dream.  I was walking with 4 or 5 different girls.  I had been
working in a Target-like store and there was a beautiful female customer and I asked her if there
was anything I could do for her.  Anything.  She told me that her new job was skydiving.  I fell at
her feet and began to kiss her feet.  Then she was sucking my balls and licking and it was
orgasmic.</p>

<p class="dream">Then I was walking with 4 or 5 different girls and french kissing each of them in
turn.  Each of them watched as I kissed the others and they all wanted to kiss and kiss.</p>

<p class="dream">Then there were 3 brothers sitting cross legged &amp; they were Buddhist (sp) and
they thought themselves into flight.</p>

<p class="dream">Then there was a huge box of lids from the pharmacy that were being recycled.
There were so many that they were sorted by color &amp; still filled several huge containers.
Then there was an organization like SPB and they recycled all the lids.</p>
