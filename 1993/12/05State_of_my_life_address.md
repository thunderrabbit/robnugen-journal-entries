<h1>State of my life address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Though my sign on my wall says &quot;Stop Looking (for a girlfriend)&quot; I still kinda am
but not entirely.</p>

<p>Cathy has said no because I won't have sex.  Diana is too religiously inclined for me.  She said
she's thought about becoming a nun so she could simply serve God.</p></li>

<li><p>My camera has been stolen.  In it were pictures of Thanksgiving activities and shit.  That
really upsets me - I can't trust the UH campus as much as I'd like to.</p></li>

<li><p>I learned a new fresh frisbee move from Danny, the light dude from the band Catherine
Wheel.</p></li>

<li><p>I have read <em>Journeys Out of the Body</em> by Robert A. Monroe.  It will take much
practice, but (I see my hands therefore I am dreaming) the first step he says is to let your body
fall asleep while your brain stays awake.  So far I have only <del>succed</del> succeeded in
falling asleep with my body.  However, my dreams are either bigger or somehow more vivid or more
memorable or just all around more.  I'm not sure what it is exactly.  I don't remember my dreams
any more than normal but I have a feeling that my conscious brain knows I'm dreaming but just
doesn't remember it.  I will keep trying.</p></li>

<li><p>My house is a fucking mess but I'll get it better.  I've built or otherwise installed small
shelves.</p></li>

<li><p>I've gone CD crazy.  I'm signed up with BMG music services &amp; I signed up Heather and I
want lots of CDs.</p></li>

<li><p>The days are getting shorter.  I look forward to the approach of Fred's birthday.</p></li>

<li><p>2 More weeks of school.</p></li>

<li><p>I have really hated Database this semester.  I hope to pass.</p></li>

<li><p>Eva the babe TA with braces kissed some guy in the hall.  Fuck.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm not looking for a girlfriend - just someone to kiss.  This changes daily.</p></li>
</ol>
