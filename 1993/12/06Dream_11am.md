<p class="dream">I just had a long dream about Melanie Barr we were in her room and some dudes ran
by outside naked &amp; we turned off the lights to <del>wa</del> see who it was and Melanie &amp; I
didn't kiss or anything, but she acted as if she were a much closer friend to me than in 'real'
life.  She accepted my suggestions &amp; hugged me and inquired about little scars or other
features on my ear or face.  She was genuinely interested in me.  wow.</p>

<p>Maggie called &amp; does not need me to take her to school today.</p>
