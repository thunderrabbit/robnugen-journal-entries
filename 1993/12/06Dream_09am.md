<p>I fell asleep instead of doing a Shamanic Journey.</p>

<p class="dream">This morning I dreamnt [sic] that I was with Madonna and that she was living with
me in dad's house.  She did my laundry for me and interacted with me as friend and lover.</p>

<p>I don't remember actually kissing her, but I bet that's how I met her in the dream.</p>

<p class="dream">We flirted &amp; almost went skinny dipping in the pond behind dad's house but
there were other guys there so I didn't.  Madonna drove Fred's bug around the Peden
&quot;block&quot; <del>)</del> and almost got busted for speeding.</p>
