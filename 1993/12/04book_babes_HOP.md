<p>I am tired.  I read Illusions by Richard Bach today, the day of Lori's going away party which I
didn't attend because Nathan was going to be there.</p>

<p>I determined that I am intimidated by Lori and other females in their (Lori &amp; Suzanne's)
group.  My upper left jaw is fucked up.</p>

<p>I am tired.  I have been trying several times this weekend to practice astral projections,
starting with simple &quot;remain <del>conssi</del> conscious while your body sleeps. I so far have
not remained conscious.</p>

<p>I went to Ultimate and we played keep away &amp; then one game of 4 on 4.</p>

<p>I think talked to Diana (the babe) in OB &amp; she was talking to James &amp; frank.  It turns
out that Diana is a bit more religiously oriented than I want. Oh Well.</p>

<p>Then Jeanine &amp; I went to House of Pies &amp; a <del>do</del> drunk dude named Dave sang the
Barney song at two different tables.  I flirted much with Angela and when I hugged her at the very
end, she did not smell like smoke and she gripped or <del>gropped m</del> groped my bicep and she
was like, &quot;&lt;moan&gt; I better get out of here.&quot;</p>

<p>Check you Later.</p>
