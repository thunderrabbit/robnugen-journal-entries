<p>&quot;Today&quot; I wrote Lori a letter describing how I feel (impressed,
intimidated) <del>by</del> <ins>about</ins> her.  As I hugged her so big when I gave it to her, I
noticed something about her.. Later Suzanne asked if Lori had been crying when she came back down.
Crying?  suzanne said Lori misses me.  I am floored shocked amazed delighted ecstatic thrilled.  I
would never have guessed.</p>

<p>Carol, who has a cool voice said she would love to play disc golf with me out at a park near her
in Austin.  Dude.</p>

<p>I want to make a trip to Austin for a weekend sometime.</p>

<p>I did a lot of screwing around <del>fod</del> today.  I almost got all my household bills &amp;
letters to Monner &amp; rent &amp; shit taken care of.</p>

<p>Oh to be out of school...</p>

<p>Suzanne &amp; I <del>had</del> did grinding kissing sex play but the pants stayed on.</p>

<p>She gave me a tape of drum beats designed to allow one to make a Shaman Voyage into the lower
earth.  I'm going to try it now.</p>
