<p class="date">1:35 AM Tuesday 16 November 1993 (Day 53)</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I remained awake through Automata.</p>

<p>I was late to database, but I got <del>some</del> my doubly linked list sorting algorithm
done.</p>

<p>Fairly soon after I announced to Molly &amp; Sabita &amp; Dave that I was not going to chase
Lisa anymore, she came in with Jason, her &quot;interest.&quot;  I was glad I had just &quot;turned
her down&quot; before I was non verbally essentially dissed when they walked in.</p>

<p>On the way out through OB, I hugged Janice, Jeanine, &amp; Diana all in sequence while they were
in line at Late night.  I showed Diana that I still had Catwoman that she gave me out of her Happy
Meal a few weeks ago.  I gave her a kiss on the hair when I hugged her again.  Jeanine got me a
Hawaiian Punch &amp; Janice disappeared. I think Diana's number is 7270.</p>

<p>I tutored Heather for 2 hours.  She owed me 10 bucks alrady, so I got 30 plus a dollar tip.  Bad
Ass.</p>

<p>My graphics project kicks butt.  It's almost done.</p>

<p>Later.</p>
