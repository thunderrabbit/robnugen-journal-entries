<p>&quot;Today&quot; I had trouble waking up since I was so tired.</p>

<p>After graphics, we ate lunch.</p>

<p>Today was our gymnastics finals, up for which Christine showed.  I did a perfect vault by my
standards and a pretty crummy parallel bar routine.</p>

<p>I ended up with a bar burn on my arm.</p>

<p>I spotted some of the girls on their balance beam routines.  Heather spanked my ass when I was
leaning over on the beam.</p>

<p>I tutored Tanya for 3 hours and she fed me &amp; gave my [sic] 5 bucks per hour.  At the end of
our time, a dude gave us each a <ins>Pizza Hut personal size</ins> pizza since they
were <del>leaving</del> closing for the day.  Cool.</p>

<p>I worked on SQL &amp; I should be able to finish it.</p>

<p>We showed off our graphics projects.  The presentation was absolutely stupid.</p>

<p>The specification of the project is designed to manipulate &amp; rotate 3 dimensional objects in
space &amp; project them &amp; perform hidden line, &amp; hidden surface removal.</p>

<p>The presentation said draw a fucking 2-D pussy Christmas tree &amp; rotate it about its axis
&amp; end up with intersecting surfaces &amp; all sorts of shit.</p>

<p>In class we were told not to worry about plane intersection problems - that they would not occur
in our projects.</p>

<p>How</p>

<p>Stupid.</p>

<p>There are just so many better things they could have had our projects do.  It
was <del>shittl</del> shitty.</p>

<p>I wrote a long e-mail message about my skating adventure &amp; mailed it to everyone.</p>
