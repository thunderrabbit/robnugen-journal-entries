<p>Yesterday I worked on graphics all day and I got excellent work done.  I have rewritten the
entire project and got the thing working as it should have for the first project.  It now uses
doubly linked lists everywhere and the code overall is much more flexible &amp; more tightly &amp;
consistently written.</p>

<p>Molly came over for a while yesterday and worked on Numerical Methods &amp; napped in my blue
recliner.</p>

<p>My project is really kick butt now.  The object names are like &quot;dave&quot; &amp;
&quot;molly&quot; instead of 1 &amp; 2.</p>

<p>I am really pleased.  Oh- and it is not restricted to objects with <del>a certain</del> the same
number of points in each face.  So I can have objects like</p>

<p>with no problem.  Very cool.</p>

<p>I did Castle of Dreams stuff for a couple hours.  Scout told me there are 188 Billion ways the
first 4 moves (4 by black 4 by white) of a chess game can occur.  1 X 10^116 ways a 40 move game can
occur.  Dude.</p>

<p>I would like to be able to play chess.</p>

<p>There is a giant food fight going on in the Castle and Elsbeth asked me my ral name.</p>

<p>Jack Dracula is hanging out with us and is his old self again.  And Tammy is back as The
Hobbit.</p>

<p>Christine &amp; Suzanne came over and we talked and had a standing tickle fight in the hall.  We
were friends and that was cool.</p>

<p>I slept then woke up at 4:35 AM in a fit of coughing.  I'm kinda sick. Bleah.</p>
