<p class="date">1:25AM Thursday 18 November 1993 (Day 55)</p>

<p>Tammy's birthday is today.</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I joking told Maggie, &quot;I'm not going to Automata today.&quot; She
accepted my decision and we hung out at her house &amp; she gave me a wonder back &amp; body
massage and worked on my ears &amp; it was fantastic.</p>

<p>We talked a lot about Cathy and my relationship in general right now.</p>

<p>Weather wise today was beautiful.</p>

<p>We went to school in time for Maggie's 2:30 racquetball class.  On the way across campus, we saw
Diana, who was watching a squirrel &amp; stuff.  I accidentally scared the squirrel though; I didn't
know it was there.</p>

<p>I hugged Diana really big &amp; talked to her at length.  We discussed growing up &amp; older
&amp; nothing.  Cool.</p>

<p>I cruised to computer scince [sic] library &amp; worked on graphics on X_Windows.  I didn't
quite get it working but I think (hope) that's cause I didn't have the correct input data.</p>

<p>I turned in my petition for writing proficiency waiver thing.</p>

<p>I strolled into database late as usual.</p>

<p>Database lab was held in the terminal room and we worked on SQLforms.</p>

<p>We filled out evaluations for Eva and I wrote in the comment section that she is really
beautiful and I want to kiss her.  (Now it's 2:45 AM)</p>

<p>While Eva was out of the room, I cracked everyone up by doing my impression of Dr
Eick. &quot;Okay let's say we have an employee named Miller and we want to change the name of the
company to Miller...&quot; He uses the name Miller for everything.  And his thick German accent
pronounces it like Millah.  It's hilarious.  and <em>I</em> was hilarious; the whole class cracked
up.</p>

<p>I went to Molly's room on my way off campus and then by Britt's room.</p>

<p>At home, Suzanne gave me a Fucking Bad Ass article about a Fresh Kick Ass roller coaster called
Kumba in Tampa Florida.  It is 3978 feet long with 7 loops.</p>

<p>The initial incline pass through on of the loops.  Fucking Bad Ass.  i will ride it.</p>

<p>I WILL RIDE IT.</p>

<p>I got around to working on graphics and holy shit the problem of Stereo Projection is suddenly
way harder than I expected.  I had to rethink a lot of how I did my functions.  However, I
carefully top down designed the changes I would have to make and as I talked to Cathy on the phone,
I implemented them.</p>

<p>I have to basically carry around an extra global matrix just in case we have the stereo
projection to do.  And then I have to be prepared to buid [sic] not one, but two new objects if
it's a stereo projection.  The object builder has to keep asking &quot;are we doing stereo?&quot;
&quot;do I need to do this twice?&quot;  The code is a big ugly patch across the beautiful tight
code I had before.</p>

<p>Cathy and I talked about stuff and how we're doing &amp; everything.  She does not have a
boyfriend, and she is independent &quot;almost to a fault.&quot;  I told her that I talked to
Maggie about her at length.  I balked a bit when I began to tell her that she is meeting the
&quot;qualifications for my ideal partner&quot; list.</p>

<p>Intrigued, she asked me to get it and we went through it.  The only ones she doesn't totally fit
are those that are not amazingly important to me.  We got to the point that we agreed there is an
attraction between us.  I think I may be more attracted to her than she is to me.  I don't know if
that makes her more attractive...</p>

<p>I did realize that if there was another guy like me also interested in her then I would be much
more likely to strive for her favor.  I specifically did not ask her about the existance [sic] of
such a guy.</p>

<p>At 1AM or so she let me go.  I typed in all the final changes to my program and.... The only
errors were a few logical errors.  EXCELLENT!!!</p>

<p>I was like BAD ASS!  You are bad Ass, Rob!  Dude!  It works it works it works.</p>

<p>Then at about 2AM as I was writing in here, I heard my computer beep.  Marcel had set [sic] me a
Talk request.  After working 12 hours straight on his program, he was having a hard time of it.  I
watched him bitch about it and he got that out of his system &amp; was left with dispair [sic].
&quot;What to do?&quot; There was a stupid error he was having with his program.</p>

<p>I told him to mail it to me and I compiled it and debugged it and after a few tries, I found the
error.  Simple - one of his lines of code had been deleted and the value of one variable was not
being initialized.  I found it.</p>

<p>Marcel has saved my ass on programs so many times that I was thankful to be able to return the
favor.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.</p>

<p>I expect him to try to Talk to me again in a bit to see how it worked out.</p>

<p>That's everything.  I'm heading for bed.</p>
