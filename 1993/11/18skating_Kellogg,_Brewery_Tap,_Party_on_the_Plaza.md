<p class="date">11:15 AM Friday 19 November 1993 (Day 56)</p>

<p>Skating was bad ass yesterday.  I first went to Christine's.  This is the first time that I have
seen or talked to her since the day she moved in below me.  (She moved out a couple days later to
1203(?) W Gray.)  She didn't go; I didn't expect her to but I wanted to see her.</p>

<p>I skated to downtown &amp; found some dudes playing frisbee in the bank drive-through of First
City Bank (I think).  That's by the &quot;Kellogg&quot; parking garage.  We played disc for a while
&amp; then did Kellogg garage twice.  Then me &amp; a dude named Ed, who was wearing a jester
looking hat and had a cute girlfriend wearing an oversized purple Jamaican hat went to a garage
called First City which is near The Park Shops.  We skated back &amp; met everyone and then we all
skated to &quot;321&quot;, the address of a bar on Richmond near Bagby.  I got some water &amp;
hung out for a bit &amp; then I cruised.  Alone, I skated back to the original spot where I saw
more skaters.  I joined them &amp; it was Beth &amp; Carrie (sp) and some dudes all who I met at
4th of July at Allen Parkway.</p>

<p>Beth has braces now. I am certain that she didn't back then.  I talked to her &amp; a dude named
Chris for a bit.  They looked somewhat together, thought.  I saw two people skating up the Kellogg
garage, so I took that opportunity to say 'see ya' to Beth.</p>

<p>It was Heather &amp; a dude maybe named Chris.  I joined them &amp; Chris wanted to race me down
the garage.  Heather didn't want to go down.  We raced &amp; Chris won, though I found out later
that he's a pussy because he can't turn right down a garage.  Pussy.</p>

<p>We did the garage again &amp; Heather was at the bottom this time.  Her wheel was fucked up so I
told them 'See ya' when Carrie &amp; some dude skated by.  They were going to Brewery Tap.  I
skated with them until we got to Party on the Plaza, where I did the stairs once &amp; one of the
tallest ramps there.  It was the ramp that I was too afraid to go down when I first went there.
Bad ass.  I cruised to Brewery Tap &amp; got some water &amp; sat with Carrie &amp; whoever it
was.  I cruised after a while &amp; skated to the Chronicle to watch the newspaper printers.  I
skated home &amp; got back at 1:20 AM.</p>

<p>Suzanne had requested hot tea to fix her throat so I brought some down to her.  I told her my
story &amp; subsequently fell asleep on her couch until 7AM this morning.  I cruised to my bed
&amp; slept &amp; now here I am.</p>
