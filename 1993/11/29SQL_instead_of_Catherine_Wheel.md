<p>&quot;Today&quot; I did SQL stuff &amp; looked for Cathy at SPB but I didn't find her.</p>

<p>SPB sponsored Catherine Wheel in concert in the Houston Room.  i was security, but only 30 or so
people came so I cruised to work on SQL.</p>

<p>I came back at the end of cleanup and helped take down the equipment.</p>

<p>I met Danny, the lighting guy who can throw a fucking fast overhand frisbee.  It is a fresh
maneuver.  I can't draw it right now so I will just have to remember it.</p>

<p>He &amp; I played disc out in the parking lot after the show &amp; everything.</p>

<p>I flirted with Janice, Rosa, Jeanine, &nbsp;Lisa on the way outside through OB on the way
home.</p>

<p>Got Tanya's &amp; my gymnastics routines printed and now we're all set.</p>
