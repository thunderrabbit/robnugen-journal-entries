<p>&quot;Today&quot; while I was working on my graphics, Laura O showed up looking like a drowned
rat.  I took her in &amp; dried her off &amp; gave her clean clothes &amp; hopped in bed with her
to warm her up.</p>

<p>She syaed for about 5 or 7 hours probably, while I worked on <del>datab</del> graphics &amp; we
napped &amp; ate pancakes &amp; had a good time.</p>

<p>I'm getting my graphics done kick ass.  I have all the projections done &amp; the hidden
surfaces are not drawn.  The visible suraces are drawn in an arbitrary order though.</p>

<p>I watched _Orchid II_ with Suzanne &amp; then we engaged in mutual oral sex but we didn't
actually have sex.  I think we did more than I'll be happy with in the morning.  I won't do it
again.</p>

<p>Cathy, the cutie from SPB called.  I will call her tomorrow since I was too late to call her
tonight.  Dagnabbit.</p>

<p>Maybe she'll be my girlfriend.  We'll see.</p>
