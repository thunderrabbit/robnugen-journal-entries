<p class="anger">10:55 PM Sunday 21 November 1993</p>

<p class="anger">Build it up now take it apart
<br />Climb up real high now fall down real far
<br />Wish there was something real
<br />wish there was something true
<br />wish there was something real
<br />in this world full of you.</p>

<p>That's enough of that.</p>

<p>I just got off the pone with Cathy.</p>

<p>She really thought about how she felt about me and she finds me quite handsome &amp; a great guy
but she is not ready for a relationship.  We talked bunches about stuff and I don't even remember
what.</p>

<p>We talked about past relationships &amp; why she's not ready for one now.</p>

<p>I somehow felt a sense of relief when she said no.  For the perfect girl, that should not
happen.  My committment [sic] to my perfect girl will be so perfectly desirable that it will be my
freedom.  Given the choice, I'll choose her.</p>

<p>Then she said that if I look for a girl then I won't find her.  I don't believe that <em>per
se</em>, but I think it's the watch pot syndrom [sic].  If I <del>wait</del> continually anticipate
something, it will seem to take longer to arrive than if I just let it come and not specifically
wait for it.</p>

<p>ANYway so I changed my message to myself.  Now it's &quot;STOP LOOKING&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So what do I do about my desire to kiss?&quot; I asked her.  She said,
&quot;either <del>surp</del> supress [sic] it, or go out with girls who are right for you now, instead of
looking for that perfect girl.&quot;</p>

<p>So there I have it.</p>

<p>So I <del>ask</del> told her I was very hypocritical:  &quot;I want to kiss you, then.&quot;  (I
had previously said something to the effect of the opposite.)  She aid it was quite tempting but
that</p>

<ol>
<li>she would want more (sex)</li>
<li>I have made my decision to not have sex</li>
<li>She doesn't want to drive herself crazy to uphold my decision against what she wants.</li>
</ol>

<p>Perfectly logical, dammit.  Shit shit shit</p>

<p>I told her that was quite logical and well thought out. Everything was cool and then at the very
end she got me.</p>

<p>&quot;It's just that the timing is wrong...&quot;</p>

<p class="anger">AAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHH!!!!!! FUCK The fucking timing which always bites my butt.</p>

<p class="anger">Shit.  So Nine inch Nails went on really loud and there <del>youg</del> you go.</p>
