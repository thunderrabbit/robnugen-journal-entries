<p>&quot;Today&quot; I went to graphics and then met Christine and we talked out by her car.</p>

<p>Apparently she still really loves me and I really touched her &amp; Nathan's lives.  Nathan now
knows he has feelings and can understand them and act upon them.  Christine can now sleep when &amp;
where she needs to instead of only in the perfect environment.</p>

<p>Cool.  She is worried that she will never find someone as cool as me ever again.  Dude.</p>

<p>After gymnastics I played Frisbee with Rita and Keisha while Wasseim talked to Tanya.  Then
Wasseim drove me to my car &amp; I cruised home.  I'm feeling somewhat sick so I slept for 2 hours
&amp; then accidentally skipped the Simpsons and I wanted to get a lot of my graphics asignment done
but I didn't get a lot of work done on it.</p>

<p>However, Fred &amp; I used our similar voices to trick Caryl (my dad's girlfriend) and it was
pretty hilarious.  Suzanne feels bad since Lori is moved and I helped her feel better.</p>

<p>Goodnight -</p>
