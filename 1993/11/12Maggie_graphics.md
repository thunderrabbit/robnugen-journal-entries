<p>&quot;Today&quot; Maggie came over for a while &amp; read while I worked on graphics.  I am
entirely rewriting my graphics assignment.  It is not too terribly big compared to Database, and it
will be much better written if I rewrite it.</p>

<p>I worked on graphics _all day_ &amp; then I went roller blading by myself.  I cruised down to
the Marble Slab area by River Oaks &amp; then back down W Gray to Cecil's bar via Niecy's house,
but I didn't knock on her dor.  I got water at Cecil's &amp; then cruised home.</p>
