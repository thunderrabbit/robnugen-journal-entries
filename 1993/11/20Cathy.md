<p>I only remember barely answering &quot;I don't know (who I'm talking to)&quot; and then she
said, &quot;let me give you a hint: &lt;something&gt;, SKI Trip, ..&quot; I immediately woke up,
&quot;Cathy! How are you dear friend?&quot; She totally made my day by calling, and I told her
so.</p>

<p>She briefly told me about her day and her plans for tomorrow.  Oh she is wonderful.</p>

<p>She apologized for being brief with me at SPB, but I told her it was totally okay and I totally
understood.  She had to cruise to meet Linda and she was &quot;within 5 minutes&quot; of on time.
Very good.</p>

<p>Tomorrow she is getting up early to exercise and I told her I would be thinking of her.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm taking my dad to the airport.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where's he going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know.  There's a joke: for all we know he stays at the airport all week.&quot;</p>

<p>I think she thought it was funny.  With that I let her go.  Oh Cathy is wonderful!</p>
