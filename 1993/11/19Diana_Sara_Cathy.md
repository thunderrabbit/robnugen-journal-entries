<p>&quot;Today&quot; I slept till <del>noon</del> <ins>11</ins> &amp; then farted around till I
went to school to take Sara to work.  I saw Diana out by PGH.  She was en route to pick up her
test.  She got it and then came back by.  I inquired about her grade but she wouldn't show me.  I
asked, &quot;do you have a boyfriend?&quot;  &quot;No.&quot;  Dude!  &quot;I'll give you a kiss for
each point you got on your test.&quot;  She got 8 (out of 20).  No more was said about kisses, but
we hugged big and she cruised.</p>

<p>Sara was with a girl named Gwen.  We went to Sara's house where we kissed a little, but she had
to quit because (I think) she couldn't handle it emotionally.</p>

<p>We drove her to work and then I went to SPB to see Cathy.  I hugged her and talked to her
briefly. Then she had to cruise.</p>

<p>I went to Comp Sci Library and farted around with graphics; I didn't get anything done.</p>

<p>Cruised home &amp; read the database chapter on SQL. Sigh.  Fuck.  Shit.  Here come database
again.</p>

<p>I played with Suzanne some.  She gave me bread.  Later.</p>
