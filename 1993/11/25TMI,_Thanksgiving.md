<p>I see my hands - therefore I am dreaming.  I'm going to start working on having lucid dreams.  I
see my hands therefore I am dreaming.  I see my hands therefore I am dreaming.</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I cooked Maggie's turkey and Molly came to hang out with me for a while.  I
did SQL for a while &amp; then Castle of Dreams.</p>

<p>Laura O didn't come to Maggie's with me.  Molly &amp; Will and John &amp; Maggie were together,
so I kinda paired up with Debbie.  I sat by her &amp; rubbed her and lay my head in her lap and
piggy backed her and everything.</p>

<p>Dinner was fantastic.  Turkey, gravy, rolls, broccoli, creamed corn, oyster casserole, cranberry
sauce, cauliflower, and pies.  Cool.</p>

<p>I read in Omni about a guy who can induce altered states of consciousness in people by using
sound.  The first state is mind awake / body asleep.</p>

<p>When I told Laura W in Chicago about it, she reminded me of lucid dreaming, which seems a likely
stepping stone to mind awake / body asleep  MABA heh.  or BAMA.  Cool.  I talked to her for about
an hour during which time Maggie &amp; John fell asleep on the couch.</p>

<p>Laura told me of a cool Windows based Usenet reader available via FTP.  I'll maybe try to snag
it.  It's a Trumpet software by NSCA (maybe) National Super Computing Association or NASC.
Something.</p>

<p>I woke Maggie up even though they looked so peaceful &amp; made me want a girlfriend.  Sigh.</p>

<p>I see my hands therefore I am dreaming.</p>
