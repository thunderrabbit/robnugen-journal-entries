<p class="date">2:05 AM Thursday 25 November 1993 Thanksgiving Day 62</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I cruised to EAG meeting at 11:30AM and Shenan sat beside me.  Cool.  I
rollerbladed to and from the meeting.  Jeanine came up and hugged me big during the meeting.</p>

<p>I got some munchies and said HI to Cathy at SPB.  I told her we need to get married after she
told me Reces Pieces are her favorite candy.  She said maybe in 10 years.</p>

<p>She agreed that Disney World will be a cool honeymoon.</p>

<p>I took her paper to SRII &amp; turned it in for her.</p>

<p>I cruised to Database and took the test, <del>though,</del> though not with flying colors or any
shit like that.</p>

<p>I <del>cra</del> cruised to the dorms and me &amp; Sachine (Marcel's roommate) went
rollerblading &amp; terrorized campus.  The best part was <del>cr</del> skating down in the parking
garage of the Hilton. It only has two levels though.</p>

<p>We played 'Lean Your Head Way Back &amp; Wath [sic] the Pipes on the Ceiling' That's a cool
game.</p>

<p>We skated in PGH, (1st, 3rd, 6th <del>)</del> floors) and AH (3rd, 6th &amp; Ground floors) Then
we rode the bus to lot 12 and the beautiful comp sci major Lisa (not Sabita's friend) rode &amp;
talked with us.  We played with the idea of her pulling us with her car, but she said nah 'cause
she didn't want to get a ticket.</p>

<p>Sachin &amp; I skate to McDonald's &amp; got water.  We couldn't get the drive through to
respond.</p>

<p>Cruised to the dorms &amp; then I drove to Party on the Plaza &amp; skated around.  Cops &amp;
stuff were setting up for the Foley's Thanksgiving Day Parade &quot;tomorrow.&quot;</p>
