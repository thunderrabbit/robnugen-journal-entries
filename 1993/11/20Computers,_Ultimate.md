<p>&quot;Today&quot; I took dad &amp; Caryl to <del>the airp</del> <ins>Hobby Airport</ins>.  Dad
gave me a bunch of software - Norton Utilities 7.0, Visual Basic, Harvard Graphics, Flight
Simulator 5.0, <ins>and OS/2</ins> and more.  I installed Norton &amp; Visual Basic.  The screen
went blank during my Visual Basic installation, but I kept pressing return and it installed itself
apparently to default values.  Cool.</p>

<p>I did Castle of Dreams for 5 hours.  I uploaded a good message addition to the food fight by
spraying a fine mist of peach nectar everywhere, thinking that Darius had yelled &quot;juice!&quot;
when he yelled, &quot;Truce!&quot;  Heh.</p>

<p>I also <del>built</del> <ins>compiled</ins> parts of me &amp; Scout's RIGHT!!! Handshake &amp;
got that put together.</p>

<p>Then Darius was a jerk acting toward Magic, a new user.  I explained to Darius the way things
are.  I'm going to get mad at him if he doesn't cool it.</p>

<p>I did my dishes &amp; got my budget caught up.</p>

<p>I called Cathy &amp; left a message for her to call me.</p>

<p>Then I cruised to Ultimate Frisbee and the ground was muddy.  Muddy &amp; wet.  Today was the
first day I've ever worn shoes at Ultimate.  I wore McCleod's, and they were great.  He'll sell
them to me for 5 bucks.</p>

<p>Wearing shoes in Ultimate really helped.  I may do that more often.  McCleud [sic] had a camera
and we got before &amp; after pictures of those who played.  Cool.</p>
