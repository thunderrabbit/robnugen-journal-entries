<p class="date">3:05AM Wednesday 24 November 1993 (Day 61)</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; Maggie &amp; I took her car to Goodson Pontiac for a check up.</p>

<p>My car started making a thumping sound on the way to school.</p>

<p>Marcel was not in graphics.  Neither was my chair.  I grabbed one from a nearby classroom.</p>

<p>I was spotted by Christine T so I talked to her for a while.  Then I worked on SQL until
gymnastics.</p>

<p>In gymnastics, I spotted Laura in <del>handsta</del> cartwheels on the beam, and I caught her
several times, including once where I basically <del>hefted</del> held her over my shoulder. </p>

<p>Today <del>we</del> Graeme had the stabilometer for some experiment he was doing.  I did it
first and did pretty well.  You stand on the thing &amp; try to keep it balanced.  It was pretty
cool.  Kiesha did it for 18 out of 20 seconds.  That is bad ass.  Excellent.</p>

<p>Laura took Heather &amp; I to American Cafe and fed us.  That was great.  I enjoy being friends
with Laura.  Lisa &amp; Sandra (Law, Astronomy) &amp; JohnEdward were there.  I hugged the
girls. Laura got me a shitload of food.  Wonderful.</p>

<p><del>I tutored Heather Hea</del> For an hour I tutored Heather, who is doing excellent on
integration by substitution.  Cool.  I had an urge to kiss the shit out of her when we were
there. I <del>surpr</del> supressed [sic] it.</p>

<p>I cruised to VAX SQL for 7 hours or so.  Greg was an amazing great help with SQL.  With his help
I'll be able to get this shit done.  Cool.</p>

<p>Night.</p>
