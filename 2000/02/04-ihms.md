<p>I am so disgusted with microsoft.

<p>I just want to cry that they make bajillions of dollars marketing shitty 
software.

<p>I'm at work, trying to install Win NT 4.0, which I have done 
successfully 3 times previously, with nearly identically hardware.  This 
time it's reporting invalid BS after it boots for the final time and I 
can't log in as administrator, the account that it specifically creates at 
installation.

<p>I tried to reinstall it to wipe everything out and make sure I didn't 
miss something, but it won't give me the option to low level format the 
drive and start from nothin'.  It will only allow me to update the current 
installation.  I did that and was not give the option to recreate the admin 
account.  I just want to start from scratch.  Please microsoft, please let 
me just start over.

<p>Grrrr
<br>- Rob
