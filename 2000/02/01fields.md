<p>I'm very excited about <em>The TIGGER Movie</em> coming on the 11th!!

<p>I've recently taken apart some hard drives and found some kick ass 
magnets in them.  As a result, I suddenly have the following questions:

<ol>
<li>Are magnetation and time related?

<li>Aren't gravitation and time related?   I think so if time gets warped 
around black holes.

<li>Isn't light "more closely related" (as far as we know) to magnetism 
than gravity?
</ol>

<p>I asked my smart friend John these questions.  If his answer is 
interesting, I'll put it in here.

<p>A couple of nights ago I was practicing on my (borrowed) unicycle, and I 
was able to go from behind my apartment, down the driveway ramp and into 
the street!!  The ramp is a significant slope - 20 degrees for about 20 
feet I'm guessing.  I'm getting better!!!!

<p>With Love
