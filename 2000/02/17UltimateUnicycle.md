<title>Ultimate and Unicycling</title>
<p class=date>1:57am CST Thursday 17 February 2000</p>

<p>Ultimate was great fun tonight!  Now I know how some of the guys (John) who play Saturday night have gotten so much better!  On Wednesdays the field is huge and everyone runs!  The structure of play is different, too: instead of playing a game to a certain number of points, we just play one point at a time.  We maintain 7 or 8 people on each team, and as people get tired of play, they swap with people on the sidelines.  That way we don't waste time picking teams between games, and it's a bit nicer to not worry about score.  We just don't keep score at all.

<p>On Saturday there's an ultimate tournament, "Huckin' For Love," sponsored by <a href="http://www.strayconesports.com">www.strayconesports.com</a>.  I just found out about it tonight, and am on the edge of late turning in my registration!  So I shall drive it to the downtown post office tonight and save one mail hop.

<p>After ultimate, I somewhat randomly stopped in the large movie theater parking lot and rode my (borrowed from Scott) unicycle!  It had been suggested by Scott that using a shopping cart would be a perfect way to help me learn!  So I found a cart that had been left out for the night and tried his suggestion.  It didn't work worth crap for me.  So I just tried to ride it.

<p>The huge flat expansiveness of the parking lot did the trick!  While I had previously been able to uni one block (on not totally flat sidewalk), about 300 feet, this time I was able to uni 112 wheel revolutions, and then a bit later, 145 wheel revolutions!  Lemme do the math - 1 foot radius wheel ~= to 6.2 foot circumfrence, * 112 and 145... I rode 703 and 911 feet!!!  Super awesome!!!  Those records of mine included some directed gentle turns as well.  Great!!

<p>(I didn't do the math above in my head - I used dc, the reverse-polish desk calculator that came with Linux.)

<p>With Love
