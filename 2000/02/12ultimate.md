<title>Ultimate</title>
<p class=date>2:04am CST Sunday 13 February 2000</p>

<p>Just finished taking a shower after playing Ultimate.  I play
barefoot, so they call me Wonderboy on the field.  This also means
that when I shower, large muddy streams flow from my feet to the
drain.  Kinda fun for the 5 year old in me.  I'm all clean now,
though.

<p>I got a surprising email recently from a woman named Dreama.  She
was doing genealogical research, looking for the middle name of her
GGGrandfather.  Turns out he is my GGGGrandfather, and she found his
name on my Geocities site.  Funniest thing is that I didn't know I had
genealogical stuff on my Geocities site!

<p>I'm guessing it was simply a reference to his name from a few years
ago when Laura and I were doing lots of research together.

<p>Super exciting news!!  I got the days-old counter working on my
site!  It was already <em>working</em> but only to tell how many days
old *I* am.  I wanted for anyone to be able to enter their birthdate,
and have it show their age in days!  And now, you <a
href="/cgi-local/days/day.cgi">can do it!</a>

<p>I also updated my <a href="/rings">webring links</a>.  I like the
new format for The Spirit Ring!  I will probably try to join one more
(or more) online journal rings.

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
