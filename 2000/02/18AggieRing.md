<p>A month ago or so, someone broke into Wende's apartment and stole most 
of her jewelry, including her Aggie Ring.  Of all the items, she says, 
there's only 4 that she really really wants to have back.  Her Aggie Ring 
is one of them.

<p>Yesterday, she got a call from the Aggie Ring Office; her ring has been 
found!

<p>A (homeless?) woman tried to sell it so she could feed her kids.  Took 
it to Sears and at first the guy was all, no, he wouldn't buy it.  But then 
he saw it was an Aggie Ring.

<p>"I'll give you twenty dollars for it."

<p>He bought the ring, called the Ring Office; they tracked down Wende. 
 She'll meet the guy and get it back on Monday!

<p>In awe of the Aggies
