<title>Year 2000</title>
<p class=date>11:28am CST Sunday 13 February 2000</p>

<p>I am super duper enjoying my new website and domain!

<p>My journal.cgi script makes it SO Easy to add entries to my
journal.  I just create the entry in the correct directory and
<em>bang</em> it's indexed!!  Perl rules.

<p>Just today I added a cool feature for YOU! To read my latest entry,
<!-- OLD: just use this <a href="/cgi-local/journal.cgi?dir=latest">link</a>. -->
just use this <a href="/journal/">link</a>.
Feel free to bookmark it; I intend for it to work indefinitely.  (Used
to be that ya had to specify a directory and it would automagically
find the latest file in the directory.  Now it automagically finds the
latest of both!)

<p>I would say I'm about halfway done moving my site to this domain.

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
