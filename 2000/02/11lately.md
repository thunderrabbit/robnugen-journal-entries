<p>If I remember correctly, I haven't written in a week!!!

<ol>
<p><li>Dallas Rally was great!  I will still write about it.  Highlights 
were Ultimate frisbee, and a entertainment by a professional magician!

<p><li>I've been working on a perl <a 
href="/cgi-local/coasters.cgi">script</a> to allow easy viewing of pictures 
with thumbnails!  Currently it draws thumbnails on the screen with links to 
the larger image.  Nothing technically fancy - it just matches up identical 
file names in different directories.  When complete, it will draw the 
thumbnails in a nice table, along with descriptions of each one!  AND when 
user clicks on thumbnail image, it will show the big image with a longer 
description below it.  Nice.

<p><li>I've been learning about PGP!  Some time ago I downloaded PGP and 
created keys for my home computer, but I never used them; I didn't really 
have a good sense of what all the terminology meant.  Yesterday and today 
I've been messing with it again.  If you have PGP ability, my key is 
available on the public key servers under "Rob Nugen at work."  There is 
also an entry for Rob Nugen at home, but don't use it.

<p><li>AaaAAannd I have just downloaded the <a 
href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@Home</a> software to use 
here at work!  I just found out about it, synchronistically twice 
yesterday.  Once at home and once at KTRU, in apparently unrelated events!

<p><li>Last thing: Today is the opening of <a 
href="http://www.tiggermovie.com"><em>The Tigger Movie</em></a>!!!  I'm 
super excited about it. I even plan to leave work a tad early to see a 
matinee showing with Wende at one of the big stadium theaters! 
 Wheeeeeee!!!!
</ol>

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
