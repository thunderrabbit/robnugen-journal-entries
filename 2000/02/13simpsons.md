<title>Simpsons and Futurama</title>
<p class=date>5:43pm CST Sunday 13 February 2000</p>

<p>Fox rules.  For a long time I watched no TV at all.  I still tell people, "I don't watch TV."  Sometimes I even say, "I don't have a TV."

<p>These statements are actually not true.  Not that I'm <em>lying</em>, but that it's been so long since I've <em>Really</em> watched TV.  I had no TV for 10 years.  That is true.

<p>I just forget that I love the Simpsons and Futurama!!!  And the most exciting thing is that Futurama is back on the air starting tonight (<em>in 12 minutes!!</em>)!!!!!

<p>I even purchased a VCR tape to record episodes.

<p>See, Wende and I wanted to be able to rent movies and watch 'em, but neither of us owned a TV.  Or a VCR.  So I bought a 13" TV/VCR combo for $119 or so from Target.  It works well for movies, and I found that by sticking a spool of floral wire into the cable connection thing, I get pretty good reception of FOX!

<p>Lovely.

<p>Wende is preparing chicken tonight.  Yay!!!

<p>With Love

<p>9 minutes!!!
