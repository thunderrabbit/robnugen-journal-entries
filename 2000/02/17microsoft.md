<p>Microsoft is dumb.

<p>I just installed Win NT 4.0 on a machine.  The OS comes with IE version 
3 or something.   I want to upgrade the browser.  I opened the browser and 
it defaulted to www.msn.com  The msn.com website detected that I need a new 
browser and sent me to an <a 
href="http://www.msn.com/help/upgrade.htm">upgrade page</a>.  Nice.  Very 
convenient for the customer.  Except for one detail.

<p>All the links on the page are broken.

<p>I emailed webmaster@msn.com to let them know.

<p>Then I visited <a href="http://www.netscape.com">netscape.com</a>.  The 
same type of upgrade alert came up.  I selected download 128-bit security 
version 4.7.  Got it no problem.
