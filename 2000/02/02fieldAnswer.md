Rob -

Magnetism and time have no first-order relationship.  

Magnetism is exactly the vector cross component of the electric field - the
forces are inexorably tied to each other, and it is virtually impossible to
have one without generating the other.

Gravitation and time are tied via General Relativity.  Most folks are
familiar with Special Relativity, the "speed of light and you don't age"
idea.  General Relativity describes the distortion of space around a large
gravitational body or field.  Distortion of space, by the constant nature of
the speed of light, requires a distortion in time as well.

Light is photons (energy), which neither have mass nor force (not completely
true, but it has to do for now).  Light isn't directly tied to electricity,
magnetism, or gravity except as energy released by the first two. 

Magnetism and gravity ARE related in some as yet undetermined way.  We have
not been able to generate energy levels high enough to unify these forces.
For example,

Electricity + Magnetism = Electromagnetic force ("room temperature")

Electromagnetic Force + Weak Nuclear Force = Electro-Weak Force 
(very high energies)

ElectroWeak + Strong Nuclear Force = Unified Force 
(very, VERY high energies)

Unified Force + Gravity = Grand Unified Force and Theory of Everything
(basically you need an accelerator the circumference of Saturn's orbit to
get this).

Combining the Grand Unified Force and General Relativity, the possibility
exists for a tenuous relationship between time and magnetism... but don't
count on ever being able to calculate it.

Hope this answers your question.
