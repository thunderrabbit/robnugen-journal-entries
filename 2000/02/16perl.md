<p>phat!

<p>I have just created a perl script that will allow one of my webpage clients to create pages on her site.  Basically it presents a textarea field so she can type text, press go and it will create the HTML for the page and write it to her site!

<p><form>
<p>filename <input type=text>

<p><textarea cols=30 rows=8>
</textarea>

<p><input type=button value="submit">
</form>

<p>The fake form above doesn't do anything, but that's the idea.  Super great!  It's a tad more complicated than what I've described, but not too much. (option to create file or append to it)

<p>I've spent longer than I had expected on it, but I'm pleased with the results!

<p>Scott and Shawn (from Tyler and OKC respectively) called me last night on 3-way, just to say HI and stuff; I talked to them for a bit about nothin' until some cop cars drove wailing down Shawn's street and he decided to go investigate the entertainment.

<p>This morning Scott called me at KTRU and I totally encouraged him to record a CD with his songs and send it in to the station!!  It'll be cool to hear his stuff on KTRU!

<p>ps  I just added an option to include your name in my <a href="/cgi-local/days/day.cgi">days old</a> counter.  If you have created a file already, but would like to add your name, email me at <a href="mailto:thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom">thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom</a> and I will delete the existing file so you can recreate it with your name! (tell me your birthdate too! ;-)
