My initial assertion about solving the 5x5 is now valid.  I have
solved it down to the point of needing to switch two side edge pieces
(as opposed to a center edge piece), as in:

c  se ce se  c      c: corner or center
se cc cs cc se     se: side edge
ce cs  c cs ce     ce: center edge
se cc cs cc se     cc: center corner
c  se ce se  c     cs: center side

This was the same place I was stuck at on the 4x4, only now I have to
find a solution that preserves the center stripes as well as the rest
of the cube.  That additional constraint shouldn't be so hard to get
around, though.

So I really am only one trick away from solving the 5x5, though that
trick is a hard trick which I'm not likely to figure out any time
soon. (Uh, well, it may be more like two tricks: I may have to
position them, and then orient them.)  Obviously, once I've gotten it,
I'll've also solved the 4x4.  At that point, it's off to the 6x6 and
7x7.  Though I don't expect to find physical versions, there's a nice
java app at <a href="https://www.tdb.uu.se/~karl">https://www.tdb.uu.se/~karl</a> I could expand to simulate
them.

Let me know when you've figured out how to get the 3x3 center squares
solved, and I'll tell you how to put the edges together.  Or, if you
like, I'll let you figure it out for yourself.

All right, time for lunch.
