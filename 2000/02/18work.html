<title>Today at work</title>
<p class=date>9:44pm CST Friday 18 February 2000</p>

<p>Today at work I got to install a Cat 5 cable for Karla's new machine!  Just like my job before this one, where cable installation was a common practice!  This time I got to purchase all the equipment and parts to make it happen.  Great fun!

<p>Had to borrow a ladder from building management; I don't know if we'll purchase one or what.

<p>Funny: I needed a small dense weight to drop down the wall so I
could easily find the hole at the bottom.  I took apart an old 340 meg
hard drive and used its little motor!  Tied the motor's wires to a
length of the string used to strip open cable (like the little string
in Band Aid wrappers).  Very innovative!

<p>I did forget to purchase one thing - snips.  Invaluable
tougher-than-scissors things to cut the cables!!  Wende brought me her
wire cutters and I used those.

<p>Tomorrow:  Huckin' For Love, the ultimate frisbee tournament!!

<p>With Love
