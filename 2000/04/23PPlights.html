<title>Lights (not!)</title>

<p>The ceiling fans in our new place had no light kits attached to
them.  In fact, the builder said they threw them all away cause they
were 'throw-away' kits anyway.

<p>Yesterday Wende and I bought a light kit at Home Depot.  I hooked
it up, screwed in a light bulb, but no light.  John is guessing they
didn't wire the fans correctly for lights.  Hmm.  We'll find out soon
enough.  

<p>Bedtime!!
