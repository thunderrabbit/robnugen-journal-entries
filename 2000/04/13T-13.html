<p>The name of this entry is pronounced "T minus 13" as in 13 hours
until closing!!  Not that I'm excited or anything...

<p>I'm kinda feeling down on myself for not being 'productive' these
past couple of weeks.. I haven't planned out my days, creating a
Things To Do Today list.  Just been Sleep, Go to work, Pack, Sleep, Go
to work, Pack.. over and over.  I guess this whole moving ordeal is a
pretty big deal, worthy of messing up my schedule. . . .

<p>I'll be glad to be back in the flow.

<p>All my stuff is packed up, almost keeping me from feeling like I'm
in my house..  It's almost like I have nothing to do here because when
I try to do something I'm like, "oh wait - that's been packed."
