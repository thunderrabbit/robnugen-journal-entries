<p>Doh! One of my website clients, <a
href="https://www.blanketstoyou.com">www.blanketstoyou.com</a>, emailed
me describing a problem with the front page of her website.  When she
views the front page from some search engines, it's different than
when she views from other search engines.

<p><em>What?</em> I'm thinking...  That makes no sense.  Complex
scenarios ran through my head - maybe these search engines have cached
old versions of the site and are showing it.

<p>Turns out I had made a silly error.  There were two versions of the
front page on her site, in two different directories.  I deleted the
old version and created a symbolic link from it to the new one.
