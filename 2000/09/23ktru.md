<p>KTRU was so much fun tonight!!  Jesse, Jordan, Ryan were my three
trainees and they all did a great job and made some good errors and
got through and by the end of the night they all said they were having
a great time and feeling better about being at the controls and stuff.

<p>I'm glad I came in from Tomball to do the shift.  Yay!

<p>(This entry is speedy because we're about to go eat with my dad for
his birthday!)
