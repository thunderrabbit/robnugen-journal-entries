<p>Today I plan to get an early start on my day; I've felt un-balanced
in different aspects of my life..  like I've just been going to work
and going home exhausted.  I plan to skate for 30 minutes this
morning.  I haven't skated in a pretty long time.  Half of me is all
scared that I won't be able to go a fraction as far as I used to.  I
know this may be true the first time I skate, but if I keep it up, I
can get that energy and stamina back.
