<p>Wende and I have decided to get a UPS for my computer.  I went to
apcc.com and found one that I want for $299.  I visited the apcc.com auction
and found it refurbished for $95.  I sent Wende the link down below, and she
sent me the reply not so far below.  This message is so cute because Wende
wrote (cough, cough) on it.  She's been sick at home all day today.  My poor
sweet angel.

Subject: Re:

it is safe to say that you amaze me sometimes with the
channels that you think of.  if this is the way to go,
then that's fine with me.  i just want to be clear
that i wouldn't mind paying whatever for a brand new
one.  i think you just wanted to play at the auction!
;-)

i love you.  (cough, cough)
