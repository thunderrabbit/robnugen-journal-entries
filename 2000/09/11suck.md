<p class=date>4pm Monday 11 September 2000

<p>Work is sucking shit today.  We've got this crappy ass client who can't
get their shit straight and I'm working on a website that they want complete
in 4 days.  The datasets behind the scene suck and everything just sucks.

<p>I shredded my star-shaped slinky instead of throwing my computer out the
window or smashing this new lovely Skandia that Wende built for me this
weekend.

<p>I would be very sad if I smashed the Skandia shelf.  It's quite nice.

<p>And then to make it even stinkier, Wende called and said she wanted to
check in with me and I told her it was crappy and she said, "I know, so I'll
let you go."  "Nooo," I whined/pleaded.  "yes, I have to" and we said bye.
Grrr.
