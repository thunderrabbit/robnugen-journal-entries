<p class=note>(dream)

<p class=dream>Circus animals were being kept alive at a landfill by
feeding them food that was being thrown away.  All the animals were
tied up in a row - elephant, lions, giraffe, zebra, horses.. and they
had been there for a year, living off the garbage that people were
throwing away.

<p class=dream>The landfill pile had been growing for many years
previous, but the maintainers quit accepting plastic bottles and
refrigerators.  Ever since then, the landfill has decomposed itself at
a rate equal to how much was being thrown away.

<p class=dream>Sean from ultimate was out there and he simply wondered
why we hadn't played frisbee yet today.  (cameo appearance in the
dream)

<p class=dream>Then we were in a record shop, looking for little
trinkets to purchase for some reason.
