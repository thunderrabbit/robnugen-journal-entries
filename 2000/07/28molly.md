<p class=date>7:49am Friday 28 July 2000</p>

<p>In an unexpected change of events, Molly woke me up this morning, with a lovely phone call inviting me to dinner.  I had to decline since Wende and I are going to family reunion.

<p>I think this is the third time I've mentioned the reunion, and ironically all three entries are stored here in my Handspring Visor.

<p>I'm going to work now.   Yay Java!
