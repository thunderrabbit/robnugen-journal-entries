hey rob,

britt daniel (of spoon) wants to do an interview
with ktru next saturday (29), and it's most likely
going to be during your shift (7 or 8).  ted and i
will be interviewing him, and were were wondering
if you'd mind us cutting into your shift.  
is this ok with you?  may we, please?

britt is rad,
deana

Lovely Deana,

In a great cosmic way, July 29 just happens to be
a night that I will be in Virginia instead of
Houston.
 
I would *love* for you to cover part of my shift,
and I will now offer to you ... the rest of my shift!
 
Will you cover my entire shift 7-10pm Saturday
July 29?
 
Feel free to say no.  I will begin asking the list
this weekend.
 
     KTRU and you
     - Rob
