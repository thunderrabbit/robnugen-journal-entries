<p>Tonight I surprised myself in I-group.  I felt disconnected from
everything, so I presented my feelings to the group and quickly found
myself in tears that I miss Wende "so much, and it's only been 2
days."

<p>The core was fear that I wouldn't be able to take care of myself
without her around.  I then recognized that I was hungry, and hadn't
eaten dinner.  So I checked out of the group and came home to eat.

<p>Read some Java In a Nutshell book, and now I'm going to bed.
