<p>Elise and I just sorted all the CDs by artist name.  They had been
sorted by genre (and not by artist at all (except that artists tend to
stick to a specific genre)), which Wende and I decided was not the
optimal way for us, considering how relatively few CDs we had for so
many genres.

<p>Now they are sorted: first soundtracks (movies and TV) sorted by
name, then artists, then various artists compilations, sorted by name
of album.
