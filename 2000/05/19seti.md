<p>I'm not sure if this will work correctly, but I'll try it.

<p>For the last 90-few days, my computer at work has been helping with the <a href="http://setiathome.berkeley.edu">Seti@home</a> project.  The idea is that astronomers have collected a lot of data, hoping to find signals from alien life.  To help the search, people can volunteer their excess computer resources to dig through the data.

<p>I'm putting this snapshot of my ranking in my journal because I have just found that I can use my linux machine at home to search data as well.  AND, my linux machine does it a lot faster than this machine.

<p>I will encourage Dude to use his machines at home to do the same.  We can start a team called MR Laboratories!!!
