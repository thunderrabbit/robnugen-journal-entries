<p>Great news!!!  Today I am 11,000 days old!!  Molly has organized a
lovely incredible afternoon!  The plan (as I know it): 
<ol>
<li>Ultimate tournament in the late morning, 
<li>meet the gang at UH entrance 5 at 1pm,
<li>play a round of disc golf on UH campus,
<li>watch <em>Gladiators</em> (oh, that reminds me; I'm s'posed to call my dad when we figure out when the movie is; maybe he can go!)
<li>dinner, etc, whatever
<li>Ultimate with Saturday Night Specials at UH entrance 5
</ol>

<p>Wow!  Can I play enough frisbee in one day?
