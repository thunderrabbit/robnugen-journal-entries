<p>As of yesterday, according to Symantec Antivirus Center for the <a href="http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/vbs.loveletter.a.html">loveletter</a> virus, there are 13 known variants of the loveletter virus.

<p>Excuse me while I rant.

<p><b>You fucking copy cats are a bunch of pansies!!!!  Changing the source code of a well written virus is spineless wussy baby bullshit pansy crap that Anyone could do!!  The sourcecode is freeware, sending itself around the world, and you think you'll be famous for adding your line of code?  You're a fucking idiot!!!  If you're gonna write a virus and destroy a bunch of someone's data, write your own fucking virus!!!!  Or at the very least, port it to another OS or MAYBE just maybe use your fucking head and DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!</b>

<p>And to whoever wrote the original virus (female or male): good job, motherfucker, it worked. Now use your brain to figure out how to repair all the damage.
