<p>ACK

<p>All day I've been doing great coding here at work (all day after KTRU) 
and then I was asked to reboot a machine.  I rebooted it properly I 
thought, but turns out I mis-chose one of the startup options.

<p>Ack ack ack ack

<p>30 minutes in mental agony standing behind my boss as he tried to figure 
out how to fix it.  I had no idea how to help, AND I'm supposed to be 
somewhere at 6:30.

<p>I called my 6:30 group and told them I'd be late; they were okay, but it 
didn't fix anything here.

<p>Ack ack ack

<p>So he fixed it temporarily, and now I'm asked to figure out why it broke 
in the first place.  The registry is corrupted, and some environment 
variables have no values.  causally related?  or just stupid microsoft?

<p>With Love anyway...
