<p class=date>9:39am CST Thursday 9 March 2000</p>

<p>This will be an ongoing entry describing my contacting Microsoft
for help with NT 4.0.

<p>Yes, yes, I do not like Microsoft.  However, I will make a best
faith attempt to objectively describe what I experience.

<p>Current situation: Last night it was deterimined that the registry
got corrupted, and some environment variables were not set up
correctly.  My goal is to repair the registry, fix the environment
variables, and store the profile on our Primary Domain Controller so
that this will not happen again.

<p>I'm about to visit support.microsoft.com to find a phone number to
call.

<p class=date>10:15am</p>

<p>erp.  Found a number that costs $295 per incident to call or $1225
for a 5-pack of Incident Calls (my capitalization).  Boss has asked me
to visit online knowledge base on registry corruption first.

<p class=date>11:03am</p>

<p>That was anti-climatic.  Although I've not fixed the problem yet.
I read on knowlege base that I can set the USER Environment variables
manually through System Icon in Control Panel.  However, when I try it
on the afflicted machine, it says "Cannot load USER Environment
Section of registry" Looked up that error message in one of our admin
books, which suggested rebooting and pressing spacebar to select last
known good profile.

<p>I had suggested that to my boss last night.  Really.

<p>The machine is busy now during the business day, so we'll mess with
it again (reboot it) tonight.
