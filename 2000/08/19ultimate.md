<p>After KTRU, Wende picked me up and drove me to ultimate!  Very low
turnout this night, but we played 4-on-4 anyway.  Unfortunately, I had to
leave after the first game; I had stepped on a shell and kinda sliced my
heel.   Cut is about 3/16ths of an inch deep and 1.5 inches long.  Mostly
callous, but it did bleed some.

<p>Fortunately, Mark L just arrived as the game was ending so he presumably
took my place.
