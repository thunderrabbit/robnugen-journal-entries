<p>fast version:

<p>We're working on a project that allows users to select the language they
want to use.

<p>Used to be that the datasets for the languages was really poorly written.

<p>With Kevin's SAS skillz and my programming skillz, we are revamping this
system.

<p>Should be a lot smoother soon.
