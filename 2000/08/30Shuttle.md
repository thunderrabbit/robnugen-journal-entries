ATLANTIS LIFTOFF SET FOR SEPT. 8 TO OPEN DOORS TO NEW STATION MODULE

     Following a thorough review of mission preparations 
yesterday, the launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis has been set for 
Sept. 8, on a mission that will open the doors to the 
International Space Station's new living quarters.

     "This mission begins a series of Station assembly flights 
aboard the Shuttle during the next year that will be as complex 
and challenging as anything NASA has ever done, including landing 
a man on the moon," Space Shuttle Program Manager Ron Dittemore 
said. "I believe these flights will be as impressive as they are 
complex. The team has done a fantastic job preparing Atlantis for 
this mission, and we're excited and ready to get started."

     Atlantis's liftoff from the Kennedy Space Center on Shuttle 
mission STS-106 will be targeted for 8:45 a.m. EDT at the opening 
of a launch window that will be less than five minutes long. 
During the planned 11-day flight, the crew of seven will spend a 
week docked to the International Space Station, unloading more 
than one and a half tons of equipment and supplies from both the 
Shuttle and from a docked Russian Progress cargo craft. 

     This mission will set the stage for the arrival of the first 
resident Station crew, planned to launch and begin living aboard 
the outpost later this year.

     Terry Wilcutt will command Atlantis and Scott D. Altman will 
be shuttle's pilot. The crew also includes mission specialists 
Edward T. Lu, Richard A. Mastracchio and Daniel C. Burbank. 
Atlantis will also carry two cosmonauts from the Russian Space 
Agency who will server as mission specialists, Yuri I. Malenchenko 
and Dr. Boris V. Morukov. 

While Atlantis is docked to the Station, Lu and Malenchenko 
are scheduled to perform one spacewalk to conduct assembly tasks.

            Atlantis is scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space 
Center at about 4 a.m. EDT Sept. 19.
