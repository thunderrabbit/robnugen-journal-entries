<title>House planning</title>
<p class=date>11:53pm CST Sunday 9 January 2000</p>

<p>This evening, after Taco Bell, Wende and I drew out some house designs.  We've jokingly said, "if we get married, we'd have to have to separate living areas -- two separate everythings..."  So we drew some designs tonight.  She spent a lot more time on one design; I whipped out a few quick ones and then drew one somewhat well.

<p>Not ready to see an architect, yet.  Plus, we are still developing our million dollars to pay for it!

<p>Back to work tomorrow.  Big big project we are starting.  It actually begins tonight as my boss has started the process of sending out 7 or 8 thousand emails to people so they can log on to our website.

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
