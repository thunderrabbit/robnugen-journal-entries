<title>Unicycle</title>
<p class=date>am 2 January 1999</p>

Yesterday Fred and I got pizza at Star Pizza (best in
Houston) and took one to Wende at work.

While we waited for her to get her lunch break, we
practiced on Fred's unicycle!!!  That was fun,
munching pizza, making brief wobbly trips up to 30
feet from the truck.

One kid asked Fred, "are you a clown?"

"No, but I'm in training."

Last night we went to Molly and Will's house for our
Christmas celebration and Molly has a unicycle!  I
totally forgot!!!  She got it during our college days
and it's sitting with flat tire in her garage.  I
think I might buy it from her!

      With Love
