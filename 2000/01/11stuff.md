<p>Nothing amazing lately...

<p>Yesterday at work I installed backup software on our big server.  (See 
how boring this entry is?)   Today I haven't really been working, which is 
fine, but means no $ for today really.  I will take an inventory of all our 
computers here at work and then I'll feel productive!

<p>Then I may go to KTRU and check out a CD for review.

<p>Went to Project Heart reunion meetin' last night and said HI to peoples 
and Amanda; figured out some Things To Do to help clean up my apartment. 
 (It really is looking cleaner lately; Wende got me 2 recycling bins from 
Container Store and I've been throwing away stuff or finding an appropriate 
place to file it)  Someone at the meeting was all, "if it doesn't support 
you or nurture you, get it out of your life (including people)."

<p>Oh!  I know..  this weekend is Houston Rally!  But I have planned no 
part of it and I almost know nothing about it.  I haven't seen the T-shirt 
design; I didn't even know they had T-shirts made until last night when 
someone asked how many they should order!

<p>Last 3 years I was heavily involved with planning, but not this time; 
I'm stepping away from local advising.  But I'll still attend, of course, 
as a district advisor.

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
