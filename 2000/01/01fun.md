<title>Balloons</title>
<p class=date>2:02am Saturday 1 January 2000</p>

<p>I take it back; there was actually one pretty cool thing for me:
retrieving balloons out of the Hyatt Regency.

<p>According to last year's paper, the Hyatt released 50,000 balloons
from its interior 30 story balcony at midnight.

<p>About 30 minutes later, we were skating near there, and I just had to
get a balloon for each of us!

<p>I careened off the street into the horde of tuxedoed men and sparkly
women waiting for cars or taxis or limos at the back exit.  I smiled to
the patrons, avoided eye contact with hotel employees, skated right in.

<p>A cop was just inside the entrance, "you can't skate in here!"

<p>"I just have to get three balloons!"

<p>"Fine, but you can't skate in here!"

<p>So I plopped down on the carpet, removed my skates, carried them in. 
I had expected to see thousands of balloons, but instead I found
thousands of balloon carcasses carpeting the carpet with a rubbery layer
of rubber.  yeah.

<p>A man smiled at me, "nice tux!"

<p>Another guy was all, "how'd you get in here?"  ("I skated!")

<p>Found some balloons that had fallen on the safe side of a table and
grabbed three.  It was quite cumbersome to carry my skates and three
inflated balloons, but I managed to get back to the door, where I
plopped down to reinstall my skates.

<p>During the process, I lost one of the balloons in a draft from the
outside.. Doh! Oh well; I still had two.

<p>Skates on, and ziinnnngg!!!  I busted out into the streets and back
toward Wende and Fred.  Oh wait, this is the wrong direction.

<p>I had gotten turned around a bit by having exited the other end of
the car passenger zone thingie.  Got my bearings back after a block, and
scampered with one balloon streaming back from each hand back toward
Wende and Fred. 

<p>Raced to beat a red light and almost bonked a car, but I swerved
asymptotically to his velocity.  

<p>Gave Wende and Fred one balloon each and we went home.

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
