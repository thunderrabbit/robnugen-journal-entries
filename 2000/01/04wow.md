<title>emacs rules</title>
<p class=date>8:12pm CST Tuesday 4 January 2000</p>

<p>This is pretty cool.  At least it's cool to me, an emacs computer nerd.

<p>First, a tiny bit of background:  I'm using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to format these pages.  The date above (which should be blue and bigger than this text (unless I change how the date is formatted)) is formatted using the following tags:

<p><pre>
&lt;p class=date&gt;date goes here&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<p>CSS enabled browsers find a class called date in the header and determines it should be blue and bigger.

<p>I'm using emacs to write journal entries.  Emacs rules.

<p>- - - - - - end of background info - - - - - - 

<p>With Fred's help, I wrote a macro in emacs that will write the CSS-html code and put the date in there automagically!  So I can just load a file, call the macro and <em>bing</em> the date line is done for me!!

<p>Note: this only works at home, where I have emacs.  At work I have to use the dumb Wordpad editor which can't do much more than cut-n-paste.  So here at home I will probably always have the correct date!  (including 2000 instead of 1999 or 1900 :-)

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
