<title>TORI and Multiplicity</title>
<p class=date>1:34pm Friday 07 January 2000</p>

<p>Yesterday and today at work we're pretty much just doing final 
preparations and testing for our big data-receiving project starting 
Monday.  I finished installation of SAS on our new machine (named TORI 
(after Tori Amos)) which will process data that's emailed to us.

<p>Today I've been banging the hell out of the process.  Flooding it with 
emails, giving it bad data, giving it incorrect filenames and file types, 
more bad data, more bad data, stomping it and it's handling everything 
fine.  Some schools of thought say therefore I'm not trying hard enough.

<p>After work and stuff yesterday, Wende and I watched 
<em>Multiplicity</em> starring Michael Keaton, Michael Keaton, Michael 
Keaton, & Michael Keaton.  Pretty cute movie.  We laughed at a couple of 
scenes.

<p>At the mushy part at the end, I was all, "wait where are the kids?  Wait 
how did that happen?"   Wende was all, "hush!!"   She was into it.  :-)

<p>Turned in another CD to KTRU today.  It was a band called Eason, CD 
called <em>Via Satellite</em>. Bluh.  terribly depressed sound.  I swilled 
it.

<p>Today we're going to watch <em>Toy Story 2</em>!!!

<p>With Love
