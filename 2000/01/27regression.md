<title>Past Life Regression</title>
<p class=date>19 January 2000</p>
<p class=note>(transcribed from audio tape)</p>

<p>Being regressed to past lives is simple.  While I was in a relaxed state (not sleeping), Lilly simply guided me to a "place" and asked me to describe it to her.  She asked questions to help guide my focus.

<p>Even during the experience, I was aware of my physical body, aware of her cat jumping over the child-gate into the room... I wasn't all zombied out like hypnotized on TV.

<p>Here is the transcription of the regression.  [comments in square brackets are mine now as I type it.]  
<br>(comments in parenthesis and other ... punctuation attempt to capture pauses, in speech.)

<p>As the text begins, I have just been mentally led through a visualization out of the chair, into a limo, out of the city, into the country, through a fog, out of the limo, walk across a bridge through more fog, then the fog clears:

<p>================================

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> What does it look like to you here?  is it an open
area?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> Open trees around grassy area.  oak type trees tall
with fluffy tops, not like pine trees
<br>thick grass in the middle very long, very pristine
clean

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> so you're not walking along the path?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I fell asleep crossing the bridge and woke up standing
in this field.
<br>I don't see anything particularly adventuresome here.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> what time of the day do you think it is?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> Noon.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> and do you have a sense of what season of the year it
is?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> summer to autumn.  the growing season is over

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> the growing season is over?
<br>how old do you think you are?  how old do you feel?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> 18 - 20

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> and where are you heading?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I'm just outstanding in my field.  [pun intended, though Lilly missed it or ignored it.]  
<br>no destination really. 

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is this place a familiar place to you?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> at first I thought it was the location of my previous
encounter with past life experience
<br>civil war, but there is no battles it's very peaceful
and calm.  very beautiful.  i don't know if it's the
same place or not.

<p>[At this point I am certain that I'm not in a past life.  I'm certain this past life stuff is just my imagination, but I still follow her lead and trust the process.]

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> if it is, it seems like it's earlier.  I'm not sure that it is.
<br>are you still just standing there

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is there a clearing or is there just woods around you?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> we're in a clearing very grassy like 100 uh 70 yards
across and thick woods all around.  turn around and I 
see the path and bridge; I can walk back.  climb down
into the creek underneath the bridge  rocky big not
not soft uh smooth rocks not a lot of water but enough
that it is flowing some and
it feeds around toward the left as if around the
clearing with big trees all around it.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> are you just walking down the creek now

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah I can easily jump from rock to rock and not get
wet. perfect balance

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> do you live close to here?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah.  this is where I play a lot.
I've never ventured this far along the creek before. I
usually come, stop this far and don't venture past 
this. 

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> why don't we go back?  we can always come back here. 
<br>is that okay with you?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I'm back up on the bridge by the clearing

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> which way is your house?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> back toward the left along the bridge

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> can you see your house?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> no

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> it's kind of a ways away isn't it?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> do you feel like going back there or would you like to
continue down the creek

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I can take the creek the other direction and it curves
like a circle around the clearing; I don't have a
sense that it goes anywhere

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> why do you come to this spot so often?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> it's beautiful and peaceful, no one really bothers me
or knows about it.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> where is the rest of your family?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> all back at the house

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> what are they doing?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I don't know really.  they just work, work the fields
and some livestock.  It doesn't make sense to me now why I don't know what they do.
<br>[I think I made it all up.]

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> maybe it's not important.

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> how soon did you leave this place?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I don't understand the question.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> did you leave this place very soon or did you continue
to live here?
<br>did you go on an adventure?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> no answer.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> okay.
<br>and what are you doing now?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> thinking that I'm not in any past life

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> you think you're just in a very relaxed place?

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> Let's move on to another place.
<br>In that life I'd like you to close your eyes, and I'm
going to count forward from 1 to 3.
and as I get to three, I'd like you to open your eyes
in another life. and try to keep them closed in this
one you'll be in a very different place.  here we go
1. 2. 3.

---------------

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> where do you seem to be Rob?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> lots of rocks.  rocky road or path looking down over the mountain type area 

<p>[this change was so dramatic - very surprising in a way.]

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> different rocks than before

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> whole terrain is different .. climate is drier.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is it a very wide road?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> about enough for one cart, plus a man on each side and still have no one fall off the road.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> this must be a pretty high mountain.

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> what's the season of the year here?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> like spring having come out of winter

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is it pretty cool?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> not really.  I think I'm bundled up.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> are you carrying anything?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> no just walking down the mountain road.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> where does the road go to?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> down the road to the closest town village city thing
so I can buy stuff for the family.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> what are you going to go buy?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I think spices.  some...  to be used for cooking or.. or healing

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> what did you just encounter?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> nothing

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is this a regular time of year that you go to this town or do you go frequently?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> just whenever it's necessary to go.  

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> you seem older here.

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah.  38.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> are you the head of the household?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I think so.  I'm sort of acting in that capacity.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> have you gotten to the town yet?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah um.. lot of activity, horses, men.  mostly people don't know who I am or don't pay attention. and I have a few coins.  they're .. they're very primitive and .. I can buy small sack of .. I don't get a sense of what it is.

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> like a.. like what, the shape of what is now a fireworks stand.  there's no inside except where the people work.  I stand outside it's covered.  need to buy a bag of something.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> and did someone send you to buy this bag or are you buying it on your own?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> my wife sent me.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is she the one who does the healing?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah.  she knows what she's doing more than me.  she.. she.. it's more like she takes care of me, and I just do things she tells me to do.  she just tells me what to do.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is she kind of like a local healer for the area?  or does she just work on you?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I don't think so..  on occasion maybe.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> not normally.

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> no

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> do y'all have children?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> we had some but they're gone.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> where have they gone to?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> one of them died in a battle and I don't remember about the other.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> and what else are you doing in town besides buying this sack of stuff?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> just seeing all the horses, wonder if I could ride one, if I could own one what it would be like.  it would certainly be faster to go up the mountain.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> how long does it take you to go back home?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> most of the afternoon to get to the town and back.  a couple hours.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> how do you feel here?  do you feel good here?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> not really much emotion.  I feel taken care of.  I don't have to think much. just do what I'm supposed to do.  it's easy enough.  and I um have a craving for adventure, but that's not me this time.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> so you stay there your whole life in that area.

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah.  I die peacefully in bed 

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> did you live to be very old?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> not real old.  48 I think.

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> and my life just went on without me.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> she sounds like she was a very self sufficient person.

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeh.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> let's move on to another one.  let's move to one where there is more activity, more people around you.  not so much the loaner.  so once again, in that lifetime, I'd like you to close your eyes, and I'm going to once again count from 1 to 3 and when I get to 3 you can open your eyes in that lifetime.  1. 2. 3.

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> On a ship.  sailing vessel.  like pirates.  with um, I'm like deck hand with ripped short clothing, big hands, very strong to pull the ropes.  I'm not the captain, but I'm well liked by the captain, I'm a good worker.  I get to sit by him at eating times, sometimes, but not always, and we sail for days.

<p>[again, this change was quite dramatic; I was more in the flow of just letting the imagery come into my mind and I simply spoke what I saw or sensed.]

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is this your regular ship that you sail on?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> we've been here for a while, a couple years.  we actually stole the ship from a different group, had to kill them to get it.  and I helped save my captain in that battle, that's why I'm so well liked now.  my name is Ric.  [spelling as R-i-c was clear to me.]

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> about how old are you in this life?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I don't know.  extremely strong, chest is huge.  muscles.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> so you're a pretty big person?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah.   [I get the sense I was like big as Conan or Arnold Schwarzenegger.]

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> and do you carry a sword or a knife?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> not right now don't have to, cause we're in the middle of the ocean, nothing to do.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> Where are y'all headed?  where is your ship headed?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> seeking adventure, something about Spain, um, we might be trying to pull of the biggest heist we have a bunch of the queens crown jewels there's been a deal worked out.  my captain set up something and we're.. we're going to .. we're going to split it with the other team, but my captain is hoping to get more than the original bargain and I know that I'll get paid plenty no matter what, just as long as we pull it off.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> and do you continue on the ship after that, or do you leave the ship?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> we leave.  we got crazy big money I think the whole ship is disbanded.  I never saw anyone again.  One man was killed. mostly it was very simple.  I think I killed someone in the process.  

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> you don't seem to have any bad feelings about that.

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> it's just what had to be done to get the money and gold.  Plus people are killed all the time.  If they had, if people weren't strong, they couldn't expect to live very long.  they shouldn't try to fight. or they shouldn't try to fight a battle they can't possibly win.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> What did you do with your money?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> bought like, at first I see like, bought a business of some sort, I don't know anything about it though.  I stayed in a hotel and I could buy sex.  never was married in this life.  by myself again.  alone.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> that seems to be a theme doesn't it?
<br>let's do one more.  see if we can pull up something different.
close your eyes in that life, remembering everything you see it'll be a new experience.  and I'm going to count forward again, from 1 to 3.  1. 2. 3.
<br>Again you can open your eyes in that life.

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> Jungle.  leading.. friends tribe through jungle.  it's becoming dark.  we've been walking a long time.

<p>[I wondered "why jungle?"  It took me a second to get used to the idea that I might truly live in the jungle.]

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> it's night time?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> it is now.  we don't make, we don't make a fire.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> you seem worried here.

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> maybe.  I don't know why we're on the trail if we're trying to not be seen.  it's a very small trail though.  that not many people know about.  and...

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> we're on the trail..  to... make, make peace
if we get to the other tribe's chief, we can make peace and there will be no more battle between us.  we're bringing them a token... (I think) like an idol on.... this... as if on a satin pillow (I can't imagine where we got one of those) very... very  secretive until we can get there.  and show them we mean no harm and want the battle to be over.
if we get caught halfway, the other tribe will try to kill us because there's.. because the battle is still going on until we make it....

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> and we do make it and I stay there....   with... I stay in the new village..

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> are you kind of like an emmisary, or..?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> maybe.. that word doesn't mean anything here.  I'm a sacrifice from my tribe to be given to this tribe

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> like a hostage

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> no

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> but in a good way, I understand what you mean  like an insurance

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> there's nothing negative at all

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> Right.  Caesar used to do that.

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I just live there now.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> Mm hmm   Did you marry into that tribe?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> Yeah.  I didn't really know her.  it was arranged; I didn't have a choice in it really.  

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> part of the ceremony.

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> she's nice enough.  No children ever.  some people were wishing we would have children but we never did.  I don't know why.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> who was wishing you would have children?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> some people hoped it would make the peace last longer, or to insure it would last longer, but it seems to be peaceful anyway.  

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> what are you doing?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> just living day to day in the village.  making...  carrying... flour grain or something and I, whittle talismans out of stone.. no, using stone, out of wood or bark, coconut or something maybe, that can be used as necklaces - little figures that can be used as tribal warriors, medicine men maybe.

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I can pretty much do whatever I want, in the village as long as I live peacefully by their rules and stay there.  at the same time I am free to go, but that would endanger the peace.  and they... my tribe knew that I would value the peace more than my freedom, but I don't feel, enslaved.. I just live here, although I think I had family... I don't see a wife, but children, a small boy who I had to leave behind.  I get to see him later; I'm very proud of him, he was about 10 , 8 when I left and I get to see him later; he's a full grown man, and the peace has stayed between our villages and I get to see him. I call him my son but he's not really.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> did you get to be very old in this life?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah.   there's no real.. keeping track of the accumulated years.. we're very aware of where we are in a given year, but don't count the years, only that we live where we are now.  

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is it mostly a tropical sort of climate?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> oh yes.. very .. incredibly thick jungle and I don't even remember how to get back to my village now.. I have a general sense of where it should be , but it's been so long that I don't even .. this is more my home to me now.  I don't want to go back.. or I know that nothing would be the same if I went back, except that it's my old village.

<p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> do you have a sense of your name?

<p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> cannot pronounce it.

<p>[I wonder about that.  If I were more deeply hypnotized, would I have began some native jungle language, long since forgotten?  One where my name is a short series of clicks and whistles?]

<p>================================

<p>And so that was it.  I unrelaxed and returned my entire self to the room, amidst an astonishing amount of knuckle cracking.  I feel like the first 'place' was my outer mind trying to get to a past life, but the other 3 seemed to come more naturally from real past life experiences.

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
