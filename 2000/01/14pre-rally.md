<title>Before Rally</title>
<p class=date>6:31pm Friday 14 January 2000</p>

<p>Rally this weekend!  And I haven't been in charge at all!  So weird.  I 
haven't packed at all!  That's not so weird.

<p>I think FINALLY Jason will be at a rally with me so we can do our bubble 
gum skit, which I am sure will be more funny to people who are there than 
people who don't see it, and probably more funny to Jason and I than anyone 
else at all.  Basically, it involves Jason and I chewing as much gum as we 
possibly can all at once.  We'll each start with a single sliver of Big 
League Chew.

<p>Today at work I am still inventorying machines, but mostly playing 
around.  I haven't been able to log much time lately.

<p>Have not been able to get the durn stinkeen modem to work on Deb's 
machine!  We've tried a couple of different modems, and actually three 
different machines.  I can hardly imagine what we're doing 'wrong'.

<p>Okay, dassit.  Have a great weekend!!

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
