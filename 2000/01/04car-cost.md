<title>Scottie cost!</title>
<p class=date>7:30am 04 January 2000</p>
Scott, my car, is in the shop.  He was leaking oil; I think I mentioned that, so I took him in on Thursday evening.  You read yesterday about how they had me on hold and all that, well I got the message back last night:

<p><ul>
<li>power steering rack for main steering is leaking fluid - $840
<li>valve cover gasket leaking oil- $110
<li>distributor mounting seal leaking oil - $118
<li>front engine oil pump seal - $395
<li>motor mounts are bad - $624
<li>radiator top tank cracked and leaking - $365
<li>lower control arms (A-frame ball joint bushings) - $690
<li>alignment - $76.50
<li>leak in rear main seal (maybe; can't tell because of other leaks) - $675
<li>Total cost: $3893.50 + tax
</ul>

<p>When I bought Scott, he cost $5300.  I love my little car.  I want to get him fixed correctly.  Last night, Wende has suggested that I take him to a different (not car dealership) place that we trust to get a second opinion.

<p>I had one other idea this morning: call Sam Malone.  Sam is an wildly popular radio personality in Houston who often does ads for the car place where Scott is.  He often will help people with monetary situations such as this.  

<p>I called and talked to Psycho Robbie who suggested that I contact Sam after the show through the main desk of the station.  I will let you know how it goes!

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
