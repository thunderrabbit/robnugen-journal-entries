<title>Anti Impressed</title>
<p class=date>1:43am Saturday 1 January 1900</p>

We went; we saw; we yawned.

Wende and I do agree one thing was cool: the last minute of the
fireworks display was pretty impressive.

(The Power Of Houston celebration was WAY better!  30 minutes of
fireworks instead of 10, and it featured a *close* F-18 flyby.)

Lots of cars slowly driving; honking; people yelling.  Maybe it's like
Terminator II:  too much hype for not that great of a movie.

I'm still excited to be able to say, "well that's how we did it in the
1900s, but that's not how we do it now!"  Or "I remember back in the
1900s..."

And I'm excited to write this first journal entry with the new 4 digits!

With Love
