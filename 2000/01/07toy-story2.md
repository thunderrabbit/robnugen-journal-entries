<title>Toy Story 2</title>
<p class=date>8:26pm CST Sunday 7 January 2000</p>

<p><em>Toy Story 2</em> was great!!  Beautiful animation and ray tracing, fabulous camera angles, great characters and hilarious scenes!

<p>I laughed to tears at one scene, where Mr Potato Head puts on his Angry Eyes.  That was hilarious!!

<p>The Star Wars scene was a bit too predictable, but the outtakes at the end made up for that.  Outtakes for animataion!!!

<p>Only one thing I missed: outtakes that involved toys and human characters.  I think that would have given stronger magic to the show.  I dunno.

<p>With Love
