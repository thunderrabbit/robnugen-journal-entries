<title>Futurama</title>

<p>Today on the way home I saw the big KRIV FOX 26 tv station. I was immediately reminded that Futurama (my new favorite show) seemed to be conspicuously missing at 7:30 after The Simpsons on Sunday.  So I stopped by to ask what was up.

<p>They were closed, and the lights were off in the office thing, but the front doors were unlocked.  In the lobby I found a small sign

                     After Hours
                     Dial 7215
</pre>

<p>I picked up the phone and dialed.

<p>"Security."

<p>"What happened to Futurama?"

<p>"Excuse me?"

<p>"Futurama!  It used to play on Sunday night, and last Sunday it wasn't on.  I saw the TV station and figured that if anyone knew, you would know."

<p>"Hang on for just a minute."

<p>While on hold, I noticed the lights come on in the office and a man walked in.  He slid open the glass window and presented the Schedule For 01-03-00.

<p>No Futurama.

<p>Bluh!  I asked if he could give me the office phone number, which he did, so I will maybe call them tomorrow.  Maybe not though; I can't seem to find the number already.

<p>I really loved Futurama!!!!!

<p>It's FREEZING tonight!!  It's like 42 degrees outside now, and it's predicted to freeze.  I guess I'll wear pants tomorrow.

<p>Picked up Scott from the Toyota place, and the guy suggested that of all the repairs, the radiator was most critical.  He gave me a phone number for a place that he said would do a good inexpensive job replacing it.  Nice.

<p>Drove home with no problems.  I'm going to get some second and maybe third opinions on it; we'll see how it goes!

<p>With Love
