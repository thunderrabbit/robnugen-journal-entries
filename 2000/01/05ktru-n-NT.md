<title>713-348-KTRU</title>
<p class=date>4:49pm Wednesday 5 January 1900</p>

<p>KTRU was great today!  We have a new phone system; I got to do an EAS 
(Emergency Alert System) test; and I learned the <em>correct</em> level to 
use for the microphone.

<p>Most fun of all that is the new phone system.  The phones have caller ID 
(except it doesn't display until <em>after</em> I answer the line (maybe 
I'll figure out a way around that)) and our new phone number spells KTRU!
713-348-KTRU, which (I also happily announced) spells 713-FIT-KTRU so 
listeners can fit their schedule to listen to KTRU!  Wheee!!!

<p>For the EAS test, I put on a long song called "Standby" which seems 
somewhat appropriate so I could say "stand by for this test."  The song was 
not made worse having a test in the middle.

<p>And finally, I learned that I need to raise my mic level or my voice is 
not properly picked up on RealAudio.  Thanks to Will, our station manager, 
for letting me know that!

<p>Between KTRU and work, Wende met me at work with some lovely Taco Bell. 
 She paid for it by returning the glass milk bottles to Kroger for $1 per 
bottle.  Together, we had collected 13 bottles.

<p>In other news, at work today I finally got the third and final machine 
up and running with Windows NT 4.0 Server!  The problem during my first 
installation attempt:  A faulty keyboard.  Yup.  Remember?  I pressed S and 
it didn't respond at all?  That was it.

<p>I'll be exchanging a few parts to the computer place tomorrow.

<p>Oh, and the cool thing about this new server: it is the Primary Domain 
Controller for our new domain.  (Windows NT domain, not Internet domain) 
 We'll be migrating to have 2 separate domains - one public and one 
private.  Nice! :-)

<p>With Love
