<title>Blankets to You</title>
<p class=date>6:41pm CST Saturday 29 January 2000</p>

<p>I have just completed the new improved <a href="http://www.blanketstoyou.com">www.blanketstoyou.com</a> website!  Now we have a real live shopping cart instead of the silly HTML form thing I had made.

<p>If you know of any new babies, send them to <a href="http://www.blanketstoyou.com">Blankets to You!</a>

<p>Also today I did 6 loads of laundry, plus a "load" that consisted of just my comforter.

<p>It is SO COLD!!!!! I had been basking in glorious 80 degree weather just a week ago and now it's 40 someodd degrees!!!!

<p>I have a new Perl project brewing in my brain: a web based cash manager thing like Quicken.  I would just use Quicken, but they don't have a version that works on Linux.  http://www.gnucash.org has been...  

<p>Well I'll be dinged.  Last time I checked, <a href="http://www.gnucash.org">gnucash.org</a> had nothing on their site but a "coming soon" message.  I'm downloading their thingie now.

<p>If I don't like Gnu Cash, I'll still write my perl thing.

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
