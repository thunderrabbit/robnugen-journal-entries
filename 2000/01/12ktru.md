<title>KTRU Mr Plow</title>
<p class=date>1:40pm Wednesday 12 January 2000</p>

<p>Wende joined me at KTRU today!  Mostly she just browsed through our
stacks, finding the perfect set of music to play.  "The Wende Set" I
dubbed it, but had to interrupt it to play my required number of
playlist tracks.  

<p>I had only 3 callers during the 3 hour show, and one asked if I could
mention his band "23" with "Bickley" and "Mr Plow" (named after a
Simpsons episode) playing at Fitzgerald's on the 15th.  I announced it
after I played "Mr Plow" medley on <em>The Simpsons Go Simpsonic</em>
CD!!

<p>A different fun request was for Tuscadero's song "Nancy Drew."  Sixty
seconds later, it was on the air. "<em>That</em> is why I love KTRU so
much!" I exclaimed over the air after the song finished.  "If I can find
a request, <em>bang</em>, it's on the air!"

<p>The next request for DJ Bill something I could not find.

<p>After KTRU, Wende and I grabbed pizza at Bambolino's and now we're
munchin.

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
