<title>Unicycling</title>
<p class=date>8:46pm CST Thursday 20 January 2000</p>

<p>Today I unicycled over 200 feet!  I first started practicing when my brother bought a unicycle around December.  He and I were each able to go about 30 feet, and he could sometimes go 40 feet.  I was so thrilled by my improvement that I borrowed a unicycle and today after practicing less than 2 hours, I went 226 feet!

<p>I borrowed it on Tuesday from a guy (Scott) who skates on Tuesday and Thursday nights.  Tonight I made it a goal to uni from my house to where we meet!  I wasn't able to get there in one shot (I even walked part of the way), but by the time I got to the parking lot, I went from one corner to where they were standing on the other side, nearly the entire block!  

<p>I measured it later to be 32 wheel revolutions, with a wheel 1 foot in diameter, it's like 6.2 * 32 feet!  After they left to skate, I started home and went a distance of 36 wheel revolutions, including down a slight incline!  Aww yeah.

<p>I've heard that tonight is full lunar eclipse night!

<p>With Love
