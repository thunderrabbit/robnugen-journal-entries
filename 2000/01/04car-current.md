<title>Sam Malone</title>
<p class=date>10:30am 04 January 2000</p>

<p>I called Sam Malone and left a voicemail.  He called me back!

<p>(Just to hear our office manager, "Rob, Sam Malone is on line 2 for 
you," was pretty awesome!)

<p>He said he didn't want to step in immediately; he wasn't there; hasn't 
seen the car; etc, but to call Mike or Randy directly, and to call him 
(Sam) back; he would be in the office until 11:30-ish.

<p>I called Mike, left a voicemail.

<p>I called Randy, talked to him directly, and he said he would look and 
either Stuart or Randy would call me back!

<p>I am so happily optimistic!

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
