<title>NT woes</title>
<p class=date>3:46pm Sunday 2 January 2000</p>

<p>I've been at work for the past 2 hours, trying to get the email thing to 
work.  I've tried a ridiculous number of variations, can't figure anything 
out, so I decided to start over.

<p>The hard drive is currently being low-level formatted; I'll install NT 
Workstation this time (which I have successfully set up before) and start 
over again when the machine needs to become a server sometime in mid 
February.

<p>Bluh!

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
