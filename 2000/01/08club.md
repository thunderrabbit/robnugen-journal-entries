<title>Investment Club</title>
<p class=date>6pm Saturday 8 January 2000</p>

<p>Today some friends of mine and I began the formation of an investment
club.  We are just in the process of hammering out our by-laws and
stuff, so I don't have much to tell you about it yet.  However, we
elected some officers, and I'm the treasurer!  Pretty cool; I get to
create reports of our fundage and individuals' contributions.

<p>We'll meet monthly and work together to research stocks and hopefully
double our dollars in 5 years.  Hopefully 10X our dollars in 5 years,
but official we hope for doubling.

<p>If you'd like to start your own investment club, visit <a

<p>Ultimate frisbee tonight!

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
