<title>reviews and shoes</title>
<p class=date>1:40pm Thursday 13 January 1900</p>

<p>I'm <a 
href="/cgi-local/reviews.cgi?file=54CrawlingWithTarts.txt">reviewing</a> a 
CD called <em>I am Telephoning A Star</em> by Crawling With Tarts.  Quite 
odd, noise-ridden wacked out stuff.  Good for the show Genetic Memory on 
KTRU.

<p>Got my car back from the shop this morning!  Scott has 2 new engine 
mounts and new radiator now for $617.  $618 more and he can get new power 
steering!

<p>Worked on installing a new modem today.  Should be a piece of cake, but 
the PnP (Plug and Pray) Microsoft BS wasn't working.  So I got an ISA modem 
and was able to get it installed.

<p>Yesterday Wende and I went to see Suzanne!  She's my ex-downstairs 
neighbor of 6 or 7 years, who moved out a couple years ago.  We helped her 
set up her new computer and got paid in ice cream from Baskin Robbins!!!

<p>Had to wear shoes today at work; we're having a guest type person visit 
to see how secure our place is.

<p>Very likely I'll go skating tonight!  I haven't been in SO Long!!

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
