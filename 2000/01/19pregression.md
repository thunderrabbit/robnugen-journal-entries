<title>Pre Regression</title>
<p class=date>1:23pm CST Wednesday 19 January 2000</p>

<p>KTRU was fun today, though not stellar.  The coolest thing: before the show, I told a friend of mine I would play some jungle, so she could hear what I mean when I use that term.  At the station, I couldn't really find any jungle..  we have lots of techno and hip hop, but very little real jungle.  

<p>So I called Tejus, the DJ who would know, if anyone knew where we had jungle.  He returned my call at noon as I was on the air and I recognized his phone number on the caller ID.  I said, "and I am *sure* I will play some jungle soon!!"

<p>He gave me a couple of options:  Photek and Panacea (sp).  I played something from Photek, but it wasn't as heavy crazy huge phat jungle as I wanted.  Nothing has matched the level of beats that I experienced at the house party back in November or so.  That was incredible.

<p>Now it's past life regression time!  My appointment is in 30 minutes!  Very exciting!!

<p>Did I mention what questions I plan to ask?

<ol>
<p><li>Have previous incarnations of me left messages or objects for my current self to find?

<p><li>May I experience between lives?

<p><li>Have I had any female lives?

<p><li>May I experience my current birth / reasons for this life?
</ol>

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
