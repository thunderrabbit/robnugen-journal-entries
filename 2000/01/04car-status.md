<title>Scott at doctor</title>
<p class=date>3:44pm Tuesday 4 January 1900</p>

<p>Optimism is good, though I'm not optimistic about getting a free fix. 
 I'm soon going to go get Scott and take him to a different shop to see 
what they say.

<p>Here at work, we just bought a .nu domain!  <a 
href="https://www.fsd.nu">www.fsd.nu</a> now points to our machines. 
 Amazing!  I looked for <a href="https://www.rob.nu">rob.nu</a>, but it's 
been taken.  Today I've mostly been messing with configuring machines and 
increasing our DSL speed, debating spellings for on-line, off-line, web 
site, e-mail (vs online, offline, website, email), and sending back the 
router from our old ISP.

<p>I love this job: such great variety!

<p>With Love

<p>PS: a note on dates: above, you may notice that I used 1900.  Here is my 
technique: If I remember in time, I put 2000.  If I totally forget, I put 
1999 (I think I've done this once on my site).  If I remember midway, I'll 
put 1900.

<p>Makes sense to me!  :-)
