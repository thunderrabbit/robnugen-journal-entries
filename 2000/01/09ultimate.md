<title>Ultimate!!</title>
<p class=date>12:33pm CST Sunday 9 January 2000</p>

<p>Ultimate last night was great fun.  We played three games and I made 2 or 3 great catches and maybe 2 great throws.  Maybe 1 great throw.

<p>My great catches were just lunge grabs just before disc hit the ground and then a lovely roll across my back from right shoulder to left hip to up on my feet!

<p>My great throws were perfectly placed forehand tosses for points.

<p>There was one other great thing I did, but I don't remember now.

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
