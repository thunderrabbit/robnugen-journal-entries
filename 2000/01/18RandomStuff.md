<title>Random Stuff</title>
<p class=date>10:28pm CST Tuesday 18 January 2000</p>

<p>I did random stuff today at work: picked up Deborah's workstation from CPE (they added a modem to it), installed Hot Spot which will turn my screensaver on instantly, inventoried a few more machines, and removed a few old usernames from our system.

<p>I also did a lot of chatting on AIM: Bryn, Matt, Bryan, Micaela, Dude, and Rocky.  Biggest chat sessions were with Bryn and Micaela. I might(!) include part of Micaela's because it included some of my thoughts on past lives and past life regression.

<p>You know why?  Because tomorrow after KTRU, I will experience a past life regression session with Lily Roddy, an astrologer and stuff in the Houston area.  She was suggested to me by my dad when I asked if he would regress me. (My dad recently obtained a degree in hypnotherapy.)

<p>Lily will record the session and I intend to transcribe a great deal of it to my website.  (Assuming a great deal of it is interesting!)

<p>Tonight I talked to Marcel.  The moment I mentioned past life stuff, we began our great biblical debate.  Not all dramatic angry debate, but just "why isn't it as clear to you as it is to me?" debate.

<p>At the very end, Marcel asked me two questions:

<p>1) Why do I believe in reincarnation?

<p>2) Why don't I believe in reincarnation?

<p>Hmmm.

<p>1) I believe in reincarnation because of evidence I've seen/heard/read about it.  There are those who say, "you can't believe all that you see/hear/read" but to that I say, "do you believe men have walked on the moon?   Were you there?"

<p>I have <em>experienced</em> astral projection.  As real an experience as I now experience myself sitting in this chair typing, I experienced astral projection.  Not like in a dream with weird and wild shapes.  I was in my bed, I woke up without opening my eyes, and I felt myself folded at the hips with my feet hovering over my face.  Just like that.  

<p>My experience of astral projection (actually I think the correct term in this case is etheric projection) ensures I <em>know</em> I do not need my body in order to survive.  I can survive outside my body.  Therefore I <em>know</em> I have a something (I call it soul) that can live without my body.  I jump to the conclusion that my physical body can die and my soul will live.

<p>I have read a book written by a man who disbelieved in past lives until he inadvertantly regressed a woman to her past lives.  <em>Many Lives, Many Masters</em> by Brian L. Weiss.

<p>I have experienced synchronicities in my life that simply cannot be attributed to chance.  Just today *today!!* as I was leaving work, I was thinking about how Lily Roddy is Phil Roddy's new identity (s/he's having a gender change), and how tomorrow I'm going to see her for this past life thing.  I started my car and turned on KTRU.  The song lyric was clearly exactly something about a man who changed his physical gender to a woman.  I had never previously heard the song.

<p>I have heard many stories about people being regressed to past lives and instantly accessing information they could not have possibly known in their current incarnation: names of dead people, foreign languages, locations of objects..

<p>What else?  What else?  I don't know I'm tired and losing my thought train.

<p>2) Why don't I believe in reincarnation?

<p>Because most people have no clear memory of past lives.  Because society says it's not true.

<p>I'll write more tomorrow.

<p>With Love
