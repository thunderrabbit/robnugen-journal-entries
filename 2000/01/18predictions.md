<title>Remote Viewing predictions</title>
<p class=date>2:01am CST Tuesday 18 January 2000</p>

<p>I'm up late tonight reading Joe McMoneagle's <em>The Ultimate Time Machine</em> in which he makes specific predictions for the next 100 years using information he gained through remote viewing.  

<p>The coolest of the predictions, or the one that made my heart jump most: A solid object four inches in diameter will actually be teletransported from a point A to a point B, by the year 2050.

<p>Wow.

<p>The book holds tons of fascinating concepts, with lots of specific predictions.  Many start around 2010, with some as early as 2004.  Many others are from 2050 to 2100.  Awesome stuff! 

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
