<title>Snail Mail</title>
<p class=date>9:29pm CST Sunday 30 January 2000</p>

<p>Today on my lovely day off from work, I began to clear off my Blue Table.  It's more like a folding desk thing, but it works as a table.  Anyway, it's been covered in papers and crap for a pretty long time.  Today I converted it to a snail mail letter writing table!  Ah, snail mail, that long lost friend connector of the 80s...

<p>I had written a couple of letters on Christmas day, but didn't have addresses for the recipients.  I did some searching through my old stuffs and found the addresses, and found some near ancient addresses for other peeps who I haven't written since back in the mid 1990s!!

<p>Most interesting of these was finding my friend Patti from high school.  I attended Tomball; she attended Jasper, and we met because our marching bands hung out together at competitions and stuff.  We never dated, but we sent hundreds of letters back and forth and back and forth over a period of what... 3 or 5 years??  Most fun part of that was drawing little episodes of The Spike and Wilbur Show, starring Spike and Wilbur, little cartoon dog and cat respectively.

<p>I had been in touch with her via phone like 5 years ago, but lost her again since then.  Today I decided to call Jasper information and try to find her parents.  There were 4 listings with her last name.  I requested the 3rd and 4th ones.  I called the 3rd one first, and <em>*bing*</em> it was her dad!!!!

<p>Super awesome!!  I gave him my name and number; he'll call her and relay the information.

<p>Funny thing:  3 or 4 minutes after I hung up with him, my phone rang.  

<p>"Hello?"  (me)

<p>"Rob?"  (her)

<p>"Patti?"

<p>"This is Colleen.  I have a question for you...."

<p>Hahahahahha!!!  One of my lovely youth.  (Rob, calm down.)

<p>Okay.

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
