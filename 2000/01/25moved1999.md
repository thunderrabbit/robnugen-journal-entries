<title>Finally moved 1999</title>
<p class=date>10:13pm CST Tuesday 25 January 2000</p>

<p>I have finally officially moved all my 1999 journal entries from Geocities to here.  It took so long because I wanted to create "this page has moved" links from all the pages on geocities to here.  I did that.  Not precise page to page matching, but I matched from page there to month here.

<p>In the process I also destroyed the front page of my geocities site.  I have a backup copy of it, but I guess it's about time to spank that front page anyway.

<p>I really have an appreciation for how difficult it is to maintain a big ass website.  This is why most people don't do it by hand!

<p>Tomorrow begins my new KTRU schedule!!  9-11am on Wednesdays!  yay!!

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob
