Thanks, G.

When I first saw the uni box, it was the written side,
and I was like,
"I guess this is my Christmas card."  Then I saw the
other side, and I
had to laugh.  I didn't bust out or anything, just
chuckled and shook
my head.  The cutie in front of me thought it was
cool, too.  "Is that
yours?" she asked.  "Yeah, that would be my brother." 
Unfortunately,
the conversation went no further.  I got lots of
chuckles and stares
on the way home.  Every one of the stamps had been
canceled by a
stamp.  Sometimes they get lazy and just draw lines
down each row, but
not this time.  I took several pictures.  It took me a
while to unpack
it because of all the comics.  Fortunately, I learned
the name of the
cartoon "Get Fuzzy" that I'd seen once and couldn't
remember where.  I
tried a few of the edible packing thingies, and they
really did taste
like stale, unflavored Cheetos.  I thought about
crisping some up in
the oven, but figured I'd just end up with crunchy,
unflavored
Cheetos.  Somehow, I don't think you needed to pad the
inside of the
seat holder thing.  I also noticed that you let the
air out of the
tire to save on weight.  I haven't yet taken it out on
the highway,
but hope to have time for that soon.  Thanks for
sending it to me.
