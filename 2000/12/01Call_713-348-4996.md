<title>ktru died.  call 713-348-4996 to complain!</title>
<p class=date>3:58am CST Friday 1 December 2000

<p>I found myself awake, with a realization of what I must do.  It's
not HUGE, and it won't land me in jail.  In the tradition of ktru, I'm
cutting up ktru bumper stickers to make a witty saying.

<p>My new ktru bumper sticker will read:

<pre>
ktru died.  call 713-348-4996 to complain!
</pre>

<p>That's the phone number of the office of the vice president of
student affairs of Rice University.

<p class=date>5:27am

<p>I have just finished the sticker.  It looks great!  Now I just need
to put it on my car.

<p class=date>6:34am

<p>Wow.  That took longer than I thought.  I have just now removed my
old KTRU stickers from my bumper.

<p class=date>8:01am

<p>Finished.  It looks great.  The sticker takes up the entire length
of my bumper, as the digits of the phone number are pretty large.
It's been exactly 24 hours since the station was murdered.
