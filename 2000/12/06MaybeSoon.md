<p>I am so relieved by this.  I'm amazed by how much
energy this has taken in my life.  And lots of people
are doing a ton more on it than me!

the negotiators have been receiving legal advice from
Lewis Taishoff 
(over 
email).  i do have the contact info for a lawyer who
is willing to help 
in 
person with our negotiations if they continue.  this
is the third day 
negotiations have gone on (for about 6-7 hours a day).
 we seem to be 
nearing an agreement.
