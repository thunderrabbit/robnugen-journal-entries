<title>Dude, I made it home.</title>
<p class=date>2:32am CST Monday 18 December 2000</p>

<p>Just arrived home after seeing <em>Dude, where's my car?</em> at
the Woodlands Mall with the youth group from Northwoods.  Big rushes
of adrenaline each time I nodded asleep for a second.  Scary and not
good leading by example..  I'm going to bed now.</p>
