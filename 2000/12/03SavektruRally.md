Subject: [savektru] RALLY INFO


Everyone is encouraged to copy this message and send
it to everyone who
might be remotely interested.  Don't worry too much if
you think that
others may already have sent this message to the same
group.  For the 
rally 
tomorrow, there can't be too much effort made.

****************************

KTRU, a wholly student operated & student funded radio
station for 30
years, has been shut down by the administration of
Rice University.  
The
reason is simple; the administration wants KTRU to
play more sports, 
but
the station and the student body reject this.  In
order to get what 
they
want the administration has resorted to force and
deceit.  Get the 
facts

Then show up for a RALLY on the center quad of Rice
campus:

Monday, December 4, 2000 4:30 pm

This will be an organized rally with faculty and
student speakers.  We
expect a very large turn out with lots of media
attention.

Ktru has the support of virtually the entire Rice
campus, now we need 
the 
support of our listeners.   We believe that the entire
Houston 
community has 
a stake in this issue, and therefore we encourage all
people to attend.


Spread the word - forward this e-mail by all possible
means.

Thanks for your support.

KTRU
