Subject: Mystery solved?

HI Karla

Upon clearing my desk, I may have solved a mystery.  I found five forks.
Not one, nor two,
but five (count 'em: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) forks.

But now there is an even grander mystery:  What causes the forks to migrate
to my desk?
Are they attracted to brilliance?  Were they protesting?  Maybe they were
just hanging out.
For now, I have washed them and returned them to the strainer.  I'll keep an
eye out for any
further fork shenanigans.
