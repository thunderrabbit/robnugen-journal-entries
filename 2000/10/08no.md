<title>No sex</title>
<p class=date>5:12am CDT Tuesday 10 October 2000

<p>This entry is difficult for me to write.

<p>Wende is my favorite girl in the whole world.  Ironically, her sex
drive has been zero for the past several months.  We have done some
sex stuff at my request or initiation, but just a couple nights ago
she asked that I don't ask her anymore.  Wende feels betrayed by her
body; she wants to have a sex drive, but simply doesn't.  On Thursday,
she will visit an OB/GYN who uses homeopathic techniques for healing.
We have talked about counseling, but neither of us has made any
efforts toward doing that.

<p>To support Wende, I have shifted my thinking around our
relationship.  I'm just pretending that she's only my roommate or
something and not expecting anything more than verbal communication.
Now when we do kiss, I'm like, "wow!  she kissed me!"
