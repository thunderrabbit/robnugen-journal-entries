<p>We just ate breakfast and are waiting for everyone to be ready to go.

<p class=date>2:31 pm

<p>Brunch was lovely; I was well received by the family, especially by 8
year old Alex who adopted me as his new friend.  "You're new," he said with
a smile.

<p>"Yes, you have not met me before..."

<p>Alex and I played a lot.  He basically climbed all over me.  Fun stuff.
:-)

<p>Conversation after brunch focused a lot on politics; Gramma is republican
and Rodd an others are democrat.

<p>We got our ceramic plate and bowl back that we painted 2 weeks ago.  They
look great.
