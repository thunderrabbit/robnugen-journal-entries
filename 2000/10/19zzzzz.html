<p>I just got home from work.  I have logged 46 hours there so far
this week.  I'm super impressed with the coolness of this project.
Not only is the text of the questions stored in a dataset, but the
format in which the questions should be displayed is stored along with
them.  This is allowing a super cool thing:  Instead of having 8
different programs for an 8 page survey, there's just 1 program for an
n page survey.

<p>Nice.  We show it to our clients "tomorrow" afternoon.

<p>This weekend is a play play play play weekend.  :-)
