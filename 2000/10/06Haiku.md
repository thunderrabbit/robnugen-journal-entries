<p class=date>7:30am Friday 6 October 2000

<p>I'm in at work pretty early compared to what is usual for me. I'm in a
wonderful good mood; Wende and I are leaving to see our New Braunfels
parents and Aunt Nancy in Austin today.

<p>On Tuesday, I sent a "reminder" email to one of our clients. I am pretty
sure the original email was never sent. She wrote:

I'll do it, of course, but this is the first request I've had. Please send
me the prior notice so I can find out why I didn't see it.

<p>Most people that I have dealt with in the business world would have
written some email including, "I'm sorry."

<p>I am quite pleased with what I wrote:

HI Carol!

I cannot find proof that I sent the original message; it is possible that it
was never sent.

I had just taken over the process of sending emails when the first messages
were to be sent; I certainly did not intend to leave you out.

As a makeup, I will write you a haiku:


Thank You to Carol
Who will provide the feedback
Though we asked her late


Thanks!
