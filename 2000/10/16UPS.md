<title>UPS</title>
<p class=date>9:41pm CDT Monday 16 October 2000

<p>Yay!!!  We just lost power in the house, but my computer stayed on
no sweat!!!  Wheeee!!  The power was only off for about 45 seconds,
and that certainly used to bug me when I'd have to run upstairs and
turn off the computer just when a little storm blew through.

<p>I have recently decided to get a PhD in Philosophy.  I just decided
this tonight after it's been brewing in my head for a while.  Maybe I
should start with some undergraduated philosophy classes.  Wende has a
book <em>Classics of Western Philosophy</em>; before I read it I'll
philosophize my own rantings here online..  Write a State of my
Philosophical Mind Address.

<p>I'll start outlining it.
