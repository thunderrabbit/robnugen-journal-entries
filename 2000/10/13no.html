<title>No Fred No CAT</title>

<p>I just learned that I did not make the Continental Advisor
Training.  I feel partly sad, partly angry, but mostly sad.  I'm just
like, tsk  sigh..  nothing to be done about it.

<p>I'm trusting that all is for the best and stuff, but I certainly
had my hopes up.  I wonder why I didn't make it.  Who did make it?  I
have heard from 4 of my youth that they made it.  That is so awesome
for them!  I haven't heard of any advisors who did.  Pbbbblt.  I know
well a couple of people who were in the group/meeting where the
decision was made.  I also know that they are sworn to secrecy about
anything that was said at the meeting.  Right now I want to ask them,
but maybe I'll lose that urge by the time I see either of them.

<p>My dad called asking if I had heard from my brother Fred.  Actually
I haven't.  I emailed him a few days ago, but didn't get a response.
Dad called his roommate who said they could get a message to him, but
didn't expect to see him anytime soon.  Hmmm.  I hope he is well.
