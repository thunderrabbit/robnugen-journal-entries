<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> I met a guy with an amazing story!
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Bryn</b>:</font>: about? 
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> Four years ago he lived in Palestine.  Moved to United States with no English knowledge and $300.
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Bryn</b>:</font>: Oh my gosh!!!!
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Bryn</b>:</font>: thast sooo cool! 
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Bryn</b>:</font>: hows he doing now? 
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> His tuition was paid at San Jacinto college.  He got off the plane, into a cab and just pointed to the address.
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Bryn</b>:</font>: oh my gosh! how lucky! 
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> He's got two jobs and is working his ass off each summer so that he lives off savings for the Fall and Spring semesters at UH, getting a degree in Chemical Engineering
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> He sleeps 3 hours per day during the week and sleeps Sunday 2am to Monday 9am
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Bryn</b>:</font>: whoa!!!!! 
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Bryn</b>:</font>: that is nothing! 
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Bryn</b>:</font>: he must be crazy! 
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> Totally!
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> He appears very happy and I see him every day.
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> He is a valet at a restaurant across the street from work.
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Bryn</b>:</font>: wow.. that is so cool 
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> Yes yes.
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> I asked why he moved...
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Bryn</b>:</font>: he must be an incredibly strong person...
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Bryn</b>:</font>: why? 
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> In Palestine, he's gotten shot 4 times from age 14 to 18 or so.
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> Because of all the war
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> They carry guns to school at 12 years old
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> The old joke is not so funny cause it's true... "They pat you down at the door of the school to see if you have a gun.  If you don't have a gun, they give you one."
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Bryn</b>:</font>: oh my gosh.......
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> He said, "here, it's Heaven"
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Bryn</b>:</font>: how old is he now?
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b>:</font> Appears to be mid 20s
