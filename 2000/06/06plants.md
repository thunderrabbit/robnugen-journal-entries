<p>Wende and I potted some plants this evening!  Delightful fun to get all messy in the dirt, er, I mean soil.  Since we moved in, we've had a "mother of thousands" rooting in a small jar near our kitchen sink, and a couple weeks ago I bought a short plumeria stalk.  Today Wende brought home some pots and soil, and even a new succulent (jade plant), and we pottd them all tonight!

<p>Mostly Wende did all the directing; she's the horticulture major.
