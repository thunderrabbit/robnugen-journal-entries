<p>Super awesome!! "The details have not been
announced yet," but KTRU is broadcasting at 91.7fm in
the real world, *and* broadcasting at 91.5fm on
campus!!  This is to fix problems with reception on
campus, !!and!! (this is the good part for me) I can
now listen to KTRU at work!!!  Used to be that the
signal didn't make it into our building well.  But now
it does!  Yay 91.5fm!!
