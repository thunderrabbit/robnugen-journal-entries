<p>Last night Wende and I saw Mission: Impossible 2.  It was pretty
stuntful, but the plot was not astonishing, and some of the stunts did
not properly conserve physical momentum.

<p>But too be sure, the stunts were really awesome. A couple of times
I could see the background on "screen" behind the actor, but not too
often, and I didn't let that ruin my movie experience.

<p>My favorite scene was remniscent of Silence of the Lambs, but Wende
said she predicted it before the scene started.

<p>Good movie for the stunts, but I give it a 1.25 thumbs up.

<p>Here's a weird thing: I was offended by the sex scenes, which were
*not* that steamy, but just seemed so degrading toward women. (or to
the woman in the scene)..  I've been reading a book called _Goddess
Sexuality_ (or something like that) and I recognize how much our
society's patriarchy is smeared through everything.  There was no
other woman in the movie (not counting extras)..  It was all multi
zillion dollar businessmen, all grappling for money and power and the
holy grail, and using the girl as bait and a pawn.  There were some
asshole-ish references to "all women lie and cheat" etc.

<p>Hmph. so I'll give the movie .75 thumbs up.
