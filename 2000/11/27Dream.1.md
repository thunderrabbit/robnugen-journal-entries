<title>dream: coding nightmare</title>

<p class=note>(dream)

<p class=dream>Looping self modifying morphing code with boundless
endless self calling functions using itself as its own parameters in a
countless variations of every possible schedule of Thanksgiving
schedules that could be written.

<p class=dream>and I was debugging it in my mind without running the
code, and certainly without a debugger.
