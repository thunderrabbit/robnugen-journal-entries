<title>transcription</title>
<p class=date>11:46pm CST Tuesday 28 November 2000

<p>I just typed 11546 characters (including HTML markup, not including
cursor motion or error correction), transcribing 1992 journal entries
from Book II of my diary.  I'm so silly.

<p>Today at work I added a ton of comments to the Ritz project.  We
are just about to make it handle multiple languages.  I wanted to get
the comments caught up before we start mucking with it more.  The cool
thing is that it's written so well that I easily see where to add the
code to allow it to do multi languages.  Pretty slick.

<p>I'm going to bed.
