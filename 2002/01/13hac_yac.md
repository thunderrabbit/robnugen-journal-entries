<title>Old mud</title>

HAC YAC meeting I decided to revisit the place where 
my bike got TOTALLY mud bogged so that I couldn't ride it.</p>

<p>Basically I had to get off at the telephone pole, and drag/carry my bike to where the freeway 
ramp up becomes an "overpass" bridge thing.</p>

<p>Crazy!</p>
