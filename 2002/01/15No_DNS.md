<p>Here at work I can't surf the web today.  Our ISPs DNS went down.
Ironically, I can still chat on AIM.  How weird is that?  Not so weird
if I know how it all works (IP versus name lookup), but it's
definitely ironic.</p>

<p>Jason gave me a link to a story about a dude who deposited a
$95,000 check.  It's near the bottom of the list at <a
href="http://www.bored.com">bored.com</a>.  Crazy.</p>
