<p><font color='blue'><b>Erika</b>:</font> what is that website?</p>
<p><font color='red'><b>Rob</b>:</font> the idea is that people with GPS
devices will hide a small something somewhere and enter its coordinates on
the website.  People will go search for the something with their GPS
devices.</p>
<p><font color='red'><b>Rob</b>:</font> Then when they find the something,
they will go back to the website and exchange stories and such.</p>
<p><font color='red'><b>Rob</b>:</font> It's a great way to adventure around
the world!</p>
<p><font color='red'><b>Rob</b>:</font> Like a huge random treasure hunt
with no final treasure, but the journey that's the gift.</p>
<p><font color='red'><b>Rob</b>:</font> WOW  How's that for poetic?
