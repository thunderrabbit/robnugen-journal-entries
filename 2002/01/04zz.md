<p class=date>1:55pm CST Saturday 5 January 2002</p>

<p>Last night I cruised over to Dude's and munched awesome enchiladas
(I think) and watched some TechTV (not surprising) and was gonna scan
some pics, but they somehow were not in my bag.  (That's cause they
are here at work)</p>

<p>Home around midnight.</p>

<p>I'm so so so so happy that the weather is warming up, even if there
is a bit of rain.  It's supposed to be 60 degrees F this weekend,
instead of silly 40 degrees that it was the past couple of days.</p>

<p>The old asphalt feeder road has been removed from the ground.  They
ground it to bits and hauled it away.</p>
