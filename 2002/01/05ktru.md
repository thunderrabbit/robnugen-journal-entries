<p class=date>7:08pm Saturday 5 January 2002</p>

<p>I'm at KTRU, getting paid $35 to listen to the
basketball game.  I played about an hour worth of
music from 6pm to 6:53pm and I wonder if there will be
a DJ to relieve me after my shift at 10pm.  We shall
see.</p>

<p>Right now I'm going to RTFM of my digital
camera.</p>

<p>I think I'll name it Shot.  (maybe) Oh, for the
record, it cost $399.99 and I paid $59 for a 4 year
no-worries-mate warranty.</p>

pics</a>. The ones that do not feature people (except for me DJing)
are those I took tonight.  The DJing one is a self portrait I took
using the timer function on the camera.  I wasn't actually on mic, but
just saying "blah blah blah" with headphones on.  :-)</p>
