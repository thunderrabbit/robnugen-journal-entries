<p>Jack and I were chillin' in the front room and someone walked up to
the door.  I was all, "come in!" before they even knocked.  Then I
realized it was Chez!  "Is that Chez??!"  Wow!  Chez is missing her
Behavioral Modification class at DCC right now; haha that's pretty
ironic I think.  Jack told us about the semester he didn't buy any
books for his college classes, and I told them about the song "Free
Guitar Lessons For Animals" by Flossie and the Unicorns.  It fit into
the conversation, really.</p>
