<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In an area with a shallow pool and I was surprised to
see some cats sitting patiently at the bottom of the pool.  I surmised
it must be an optical illusion of some sort, but I got into the pool
and it was no trick; there really were cats in there.  I tried to
avoid them as they seemed not too keen on having visitors, but one of
them clawed me in the back of my right hand.  I was able to get my
hand away and then get out of the pool.</p>
