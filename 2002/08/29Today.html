<p>Wow.  Cool stuff in my life.</p>

<p>I've just read my friends' entries on <a
href="https://www.livejournal.com/users/thunderrabbit/friends">livejournal</a>.
not "caught up" by any means, but read the last 25 entries.  I had
been reading them and keeping up about a year+ ago, but quit after I
simply couldn't keep up due to work.  I'm not exactly a workin' man
these days, so I have a bit more time, but I'm trying not to waste all
of it in front of the computer.</p>

<p>Today Janette and I went for a walk and explored inside a two story
house under construction in her neighborhood.  There was a lot of mud
around the back (where we entered) so we spent some time scraping it
off before walking inside on their new (unsealed) hardwood floor.
We're such considerate tresspassers.</p>

<p>We watched <em>Richard Pryor: Alive and Smokin'</em> which is one
of his first stand up comedy things, and he was openly nervous about
the cameras.  Interesting stuff.  And he was harshing on Nixon, which
is so weird cause that shit was current events in 1971.  Funny.</p>

<p>But the best part was that the tape, featuring plenty of
explitives, ended just <em>minutes</em> before Janette's mom-in-law
came over.  Wow.  Excellent timing.</p>

<p>I just made a CD for Janette featuring some Eminem from <em>The
Marshall Mathers LP</em> and Korn from <em>Life is Peachy</em>.  I
accidentally put "I'm a Criminal" on there twice.  Ironic.</p>
