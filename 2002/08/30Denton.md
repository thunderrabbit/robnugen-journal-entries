<p class=date>8:44am CDT Friday 30 August 2002</p>

<p>Chillin' in Denton today, will mostly do computer stuff while Marta
is in school and such.</p>

<p>Tulsa Rally tonight!  I will be taking Jackie Purdy after her thing
at school ends no earlier than 9pm, though she won't know what time it
will end until later today.  I talked with her last night while
driving to Denton.  Got directions to her school and all that.</p>

<p class=date>11:28am</p>

<p>Have just accompanied Marta to her school for an appointment,
during which I read WIRED magazine January 2002 issue.  Some cat is
hoping to start a new internet economy based on <a
href="http://www.e-gold.com">gold standard</a>.</p>

<p>I have just read their user agreement.  I think I'll open an
account.</p>

<p>Oh shit, hey Fred check this out (not that you ever read my
journal, but hey): they're using an SRK passphrase thing to allow
entering the password via mouseclicks on a randomly changing keyboard
displayed on the screen.  Nice.</p>

<p>It was too cumbersome to use with a bunch of symbols in my password
though, so I took a risk and entered my password using my keyboard.
Whew!</p>

<p>Aight, join the fun and create your own <a

Hooray!</p>
