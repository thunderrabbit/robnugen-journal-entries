<p>Going to Houston now.  Jack is going with me.  Hugs to Joey, who is
now home alone.</p>

<p class=date>12:44pm</p>

<p>Jack and I forgot to stop by Rick's house on the way out.  We are
here now and about to leave again.</p>

<p class=message>jack here
<br>once we got back on the road rob took the initiative to cut the small
talk by asking some thought provoking conversation stimulating
questions.
<br>discussed my ire with the worlds general destructive ways.
<br>found out about some of robs spritual leanings. obviously something he
has put a lot positive solid  thought into. not an area ive explored much.
the conversation turned to games and rob told me about a game him and
kt once played in which  participants pronounce all the road signs
they see. we eventually played that a bit.
<br>talked about tulsa rally. we both gave the situation a solid grrrrr.
arranged to see meg robinson upon arrival.
<br>i asked a lot of questions about yruu history. rob was very helpful. 
gas and a small snack for me. 
<br>im lucky to have gotten the chance to have interesting dialogue.

<p>We're at Meg Robinson's house now, and I'm going to leave soon,
with or without Jack, depending on if he cannot or can get another
ride to downtown.</p>

<p class=date>11:46pm</p>

<p>Left with Jack, but did not get him to the bus station quickly
enough for him to catch the 6:15pm bus to Beaumont.  Left him in the
parking lot across the street from the bus station and went to visit
Jennifer at Paint This! and drop off my (borrowed) unicycle at the
Schwinn shop to get the axel fixed.  It rotates inside the wheel hub
instead of being well attached.</p>

<p>HI to Jennifer and then followed her to her house to visit Spot,
and felt a bit nostalgic seeing him, and he wasn't all that super
excited to see me, but it's all good; he's a happy outdoor cat, and
I'm thankful for that.  He seems quite content in his new life.</p>

<p>Called Wende, but she wasn't home, so I called Maggie, but she
wasn't home, so I called Molly and went to her house.  Molly fed me a
boca burger with pickles, mayonnaise, lettuce on toasted buns.</p>

<p>Watched Discovery Channel about plans for a big ass cone shaped
building, a big ass mile long ship, and a big ass bridge over the
Gibraltar Straight.  We decided the building seemed most feasible.</p>

<p>Maggie arrived and I got to cuddle with her on the couch, which
reminded me of college days in her dorm studying physics, or watching
The Simpsons uabwmaah.</p>

<p>Left around 10pm for my dad's house to check my 2.5 inches worth of
snail mail, and say HI to Dad, Karen, and Elise.  Have just gone
through my snail mail with no real surprises.  I'm glad about
that.</p>

<p>Will talk with Elise tonight and then go get my (borrowed) unicycle
tomorrow and go ride around with Jason down in Clear Lake.</p>

<p class=date>1:26am</p>

<p>Hung out talking with Elise; she told me stories of cats and
kittens and a guy named Ryan who has the same birthday as hers, but
he's three years older.</p>

<p>I told her stories of my recent adventures, including Ad-Libs, and
the creation of the song Ants and Cheese.</p>
