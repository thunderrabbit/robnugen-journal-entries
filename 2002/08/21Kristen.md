<p>Have been hanging out with Kristen for the past hour or so.  Took
Daisy their little poodle to pick up Jessica from her friend Alexis'
house.  Jessica didn't come outside immediately (even after Kristen
honked her horn) so I walked up to the door with Daisy and when they
came to the door I said, "we found this dog in your neighborhood and
wondered if it was yours...."</p>

<p>Super thanks to Kristen for lunch of chicken and a big noodle shell
thing.  :-)</p>
