<p>Jack: "May I do some laundry?"</p>

<p>Sean: "Yeah.  You can do some of your own while you're at it."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We're playing Wahoo again.</p>

<p>Rob: "I wonder if we can go to MJ Designs and get another ball to
match this color [of the set of four balls with one ball off color]?"</p>

<p>Sean: "I'm sure we can.  In fact that's where these balls came from
at MJ Designs."</p>

<p>Rob: "We should go tonight.  Right now."</p>

<p>Sean: "Throw the missing ball to break the window."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Jack:</p>

<p>"Do I wanna be free or do I wanna get outta this place?"</p>

<p>"Six, Harto."</p>

<p>"Ohh.  Lu five."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Hart:</p>

<p>"I've never heard that one.  I've heard Harticus."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Joey:</p>

<p>"Why do I keep killing you? It's great."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Game over.  I lost.  Jack won even though he kept getting knocked
back and then couldn't get a four and when he no longer needed a four
and rolled a four he freaked out and rolled sideways off the ottoman
onto the floor with a thunk yelling, "now I roll a fucking timely
four!"  (Sean and Joey's mom was trying to sleep in the next room,
separated only by a glass door a light curtain.) Joey came in second,
then Hart had a glorious run of sixes and ones to send himself nearly
all the way around the board while I just needed to roll a single 1
and I would have won the game some time ago.  Funny stuff..</p>

<p>After Hart won, I rolled three separate dice in sequence and got a
three, then a two, then a one.</p>
