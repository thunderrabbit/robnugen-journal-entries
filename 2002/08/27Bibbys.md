<p class=date>9:31am CDT Tuesday 27 August 2002</p>

<p>Arrived last night here at the Bibby's.  Drove from Denton to here
while talking with Dude up in Eugene Oregon.  He's got a personalized
home phone number again.</p>

<p>Josephine watched Muppet Christmas while Jack computered.  He got a
new email address at <a href="http://www.gohip.com">gohip.com</a>.
When Janette was all, "Jojo, you have school tomorrow," Joey was all,
"<em>I</em> don't have to go to school, <em>you</em> have to go to
school!"  So funny!</p>

<p>It rained a lot last night/this morning, so I'm going to help
Janette pull weeds out of her garden since the ground is soft.</p>

<p>Jack and I have just helped Janette move a vanload of her antiques
from an antique store to Sean's old room.  Heaviest thing was a
concrete birdbath.  Largest things were two ladders.  Most surprising
thing to me is a wooden Victorian architecture thing called
gingerbread, which was probably made in the late 1800s.  Cool
stuff.</p>

<p>Jack is checking his email now as he might join Rick at Senator
Graham's office to protest the proposed war in Iraq.</p>

<p class=date>6:21pm</p>

<p>We made two more trips, and turns out that the anti-war meeting is
tomorrow not today.  I took a phat nap afterward, and have been
reading <em>Culture Shock Japan!</em> for the past hour plus.</p>
