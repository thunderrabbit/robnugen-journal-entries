<p class=date>8:39pm CDT Sunday 18 August 2002</p>

<p>Today has been a great YRUU day.  Marta and I went to church and
then YRUU at First Jefferson church in Fort Worth, and then drove
Sean, Josephine and Jack back to Bibby House.</p>

<p>There we slept for an hour then drove to Plano YRUU (YAC planning
meeting first, starring Jackie, Kate, Megan) where we played Fruit
Basket, with the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Megan: Tomato (pronounced "to MAH to")</li>
<li>Sean: Mamachino</li>
<li>Marta: Cherry</li>
<li>Rob: Star Fruit (I'm a star.  fruit.)</li>
<li>Jordan: Pineapple</li>
<li>Sarah: Strawberry</li>
<li>Jon: Orange</li>
<li>Simon: Lime</li>
<li>Jackie: Pompamous ? (grapefruit(?) in French)</li>
<li>Neil: Habanero</li>
<li>Leigh: Tangelo</li>
<li>Kate: Nectarine</li>
<li>David: Sweet Pluma</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that's everyone.  Thanks to Marta for remembering them
all.</p>

<p>Simon kept picking on Jackie and tagging the shit out of her as
soon as someone said her fruit name.  So one time we played a round
with him in the center and wouldn't choose her fruit name.</p>

<p>An interesting thing happened that I saw happen with this game at
Fort Worth Rally 1998 (Son of Duck) when we played a stand up version
of this game called the Zoo Game where everyone chooses an animal.
That is the person in the middle would go really slowly, and not tag
people who were super slow, or even really try to play.  In my mind,
this brought down the energy of the game, and made it less interesting
to play.</p>

<p>Also interesting that I had just been at Ft Worth church earlier
that day.</p>

<p>I've just dropped off Marta at her house (since her car is sick)
and am driving back to Chez Bibby now.  (Not Chez, but the french word
for house).</p>
