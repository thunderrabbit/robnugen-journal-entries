<p class=date>3:22am CDT Saturday 17 August 2002</p>

<p>Just FTPd from Hart's computer several .mp3s, including some Eminem
from The Marshall Mathers EP.  The one named "Stan (ft. Dido)" is
funny.  I wonder if that shit actually happened.  That's fucked up if
it did.</p>

<p>Listening to Filter & The Crystal Method now.</p>

<p class=date>4:01am</p>

<p>Cypress Hill, 2 Live Crew, A Tribe Called Quest, Fatboy Slim,
Eminem, Filter, Jay & Silent Bob, Run-DMC, et. al.</p>

<p>Bed soon, probably.</p>

<p>I'm enjoying my vacation.</p>

<p class=date>4:20am</p>

<p>They Might Be Giants, Sir Mix-A-Lot (more), Run-DMC (more), Biz
Markie "just a friend"</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
