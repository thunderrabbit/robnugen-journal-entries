<p class=date>2:59am CDT Sunday 18 August 2002</p>

<p>Janette, Marta and I just got back from watching (I just lost at
Wahoo again) the 12:30am showing of Blue Crush, starring some cute
surfer girl(s) and one cute and some fat football players.  I cried at
the end when the other local girls were all, "can I have your
autograph?"  Ah, the simple things are beautiful.</p>

<p>Everytime they showed the underwater cracking head on coral scene I
was all cringing and had to remind myself that I was safe, in a
theater, watching a movie, Oww fuck that hurts!  oh, I'm safe, in a
theater, watching a movie..</p>

<p>It was good.  XXX was better.</p>

<p>"You're going to surf wearing that?"</p>

<p>"Naw, I'm going to surf wearing my dudantada."</p>

<p>"Your what?"</p>

<p>"My," rips off shorts revealing a speedo, "Dudan Tada!!!"</p>

<p>"heehee you're wearing a nut hugger!"</p>

<p>So much fun going out so late on a church night!  Whooo!</p>
