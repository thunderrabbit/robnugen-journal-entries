<p>Janette and I visited a flea market in Canton, Texas, which is a
weekend long monthly event.  Actually the sellers arrive on Wednesday
and set up and some people come in on Thursday and then melee on
Friday through Sunday morning and throngs of people buy all kinds of
junk.  Okay, not all of it was junk, but some of it certainly was.
Definitely all of it was just stuff.</p>

<p>Two guys had a stand of hundreds of commemerative soft drink
bottles, almost all of which were unopened.  They didn't have any
Texas Aggie 1994 Dr Pepper bottles, or I woulda bought one for
Wende.</p>

<p>One cat had a bunch of marbles with little logos on them.  Soft
drink logos, football teams, specific players' names and jersey
numbers, flags, college emblems, cartoon characters, musicians, tons
of stuff.</p>

<p>One guy (who mostly had a bunch of junk (like a water damaged
cardboard undated political poster for someone I've never heard of)
had some Victrola 78 rpm records, which I went through and found one
that I'll give to Forest, who has a player.  Music is only recorded on
one side.  Fifty cents.</p>
