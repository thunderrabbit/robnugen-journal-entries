<p>In Plano YRUU, Jon had out a little hand held video game thing and
I asked him if he was able to save his place in the game.  At that
moment I wasn't asking him to turn it off so we could have check-in
(though that could have been a viable reason), but wondering more
about the state of technology, cause "back in my day we had games like
Split Second and Simon, and we couldn't save anything."</p>

<p>Simon was all, "haha you had a game named Simon."</p>

<p>Jackie said, "there should be a game called Jackie."</p>

<p>So we made one up:</p>

<p>Jackie's Purdy Game</p>

<p>5 to 15 players</p>

<p>Three people are selected to be named Jackie 1, Jackie 2, Jackie 3.
They all leave the room and one of the Jackies briefly tells the
others a story about themselves that no one has heard.  They come back
into the room and each one gives a summary of the story.  Then the
rest of the group asks probing questions about the story to specific
Jackies.</p>

<p>eg: "Jackie 2, what type of beverages were there?" or "Jackie 3,
what color was the mouse?"  That kind of thing.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of questioning, the group comes to consensus of
who they think the real Jackie is.</p>

<p>Come to find out, this game is one that used to be a TV game show
from 30 years ago.  I thought Marta made it up, but no.</p>
