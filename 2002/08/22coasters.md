<p>I just watched Coaster Rush Week on the travel channel, and it
appears that I should make a visit to Cedar Point in Sandusky Ohio,
and possibly to Busch Gardens in Virginia.  Maybe 2 days at Cedar
Point.</p>

<p>Abbey said Cedar Point was relatively close to where she lives, so
maybe I can use her place as a base.</p>

<p>Bedtime for me now.</p>
