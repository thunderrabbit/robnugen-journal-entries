<p>Janette and I went for a walk around the lake tonight - talked
about God and reality and sin and hell and heaven and death and life
and everything.  Fantastic conversation.</p>

<p>Chilled on my beach chairs in the yard and I actually fell asleep a
bit; the air was so perfectly perfect.  Super nice.</p>
