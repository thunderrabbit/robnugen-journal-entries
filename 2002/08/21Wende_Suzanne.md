<p class=date>5:50pm CDT Wednesday 21 August 2002</p>

<p>After saying HI (and bye) to Kristen, I visited Kinko's up near my
ex-apartment.  Then over to La Jaliscience (including making a U turn
in the middle of Main Street near First Church on Fannin, yahoo!) to
have dinner with Wende, whose possessions will be packed by a swarm of
movers tomorrow so she can vacate to San Francisco, where she has an
apartment selected.</p>

<p>Called Suzanne and confirmed I could sleep over at her house
tonight, so after helping Wende that her new 25 inch TV works (it was
still in the box), I drove over to Suzanne's where we just watched
Pearl Harbor when we might have exchanged stories and stuff, but oh
well.  None of us had seen the movie so it's all good.  (None = not
me, Suzanne, nor Trish)</p>

<p>I'm going to stay up and watch more movies a bit via their
satellite.</p>
