<p>I'm driving to Austin today, to attend the First UU lock-in
tonight.  Ironically, the Houston youth are having a lock-in tonight,
which I would love love love to attend, but I already committed to the
Austin group before I heard about the Houston lock-in.</p>

<p>I'm closer on putting my new journal thing online.  You can beta
test it at <a
href="/cgi-local/journal.pl">http://www.robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl</a>.
<a href="mailto:freaky_journal@robnugen.com">Let me know</a> if you
see anything freaky, not including that it doesn't properly display
1996, 1997, nor 1998 entries.</p>

<p>Aight.  I'm in Austin.  It took me 12 minutes to get into Fred's
building cause I had the correct door code, but didn't know I have to
turn the door knob counter clockwise instead of clockwise.  Silly
door.  Fred pretty much hates the design of the door latch.  It
requires the use of two hands: 1 to turn the knob and the other to
pull the handle.  The knob is too small to realistically grasp and
pull hard enough to open the door.</p>

<p>We're listening to the soundtrack of Star Wars Episode I: The
Phantom Menace</p>

<p>Fred and I laughed at some Eminem songs; they are just so perverse
and funny!  Fred hadn't really heard any Eminem stuff.</p>

<p>Drank smoothies and ate sandwiches, both lovely creations of
Fred's.  Excellent stuff.</p>

<p>Rode bikes to his school; I made a truck hit his brakes hard enough
to skid, but I didn't get in his way; I just looked like I was going
to.  Bike lane the rest of the way and now he's doing Fred stuff, and
I'm ripping CDs, scanning for viruses, working on my journal.pl</p>
