<p>After Monica's Marta and I arrived at the Bibby's and Janette was
all cleaning the kitchen and such and then was all, "you wanna go for
a walk?"  So we went to see the house where Marta used to be a nanny
for four kids back some years ago.</p>

<p>But first we crept inside a three story house being built a block
down the street from Janette's.  The wood frame and floor and
everything was all built, but no walls were up yet.  Maggie called
while we were inside, and I was all giddy and laughing at the
funniness of the situation and how fun it was to be all climbing
around in the dark and such.</p>

<p>I was wearing no shoes, so I trod carefully in the darkness, but it
seemed relatively safe and flat everywhere.  I climbed out onto the
makeshift scaffolding on the edge of the house that was apparently
being used to let the worker guys do outside-house building stuff up
around the roof.  It was stable, but seemed a bit risky to Marta and
Janette, silly girls.</p>

<p>It turns out though, they had been daring one another to walk on it
while I was in a different part of the house.  That's funny.  I wonder
if I subconsiously heard their dare.  I think I just did it as a
self-dare-challenge thing.</p>

<p>I also climbed up through the unfinished roof and saw something
vertical that looked like a chimney in a way, but had no opening in
the roof to let smoke/etc out.  Weird.  I don't know what it was.</p>
