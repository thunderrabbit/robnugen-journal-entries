<p>I'm in Denton now.  After YRUU, I followed Marta to her parents
house where she dropped off her mom's car, and then I drove her home.
Turns out that Denton is closer to DFW than Dallas, so I'm going to
stay here and hopefully track down Bryn's exact leaving arrangements
so I can see her off to UK.</p>

<p>Marta and I just watched Dogma.  Ironically we both watched it this
past week, possibly both on the same night.  Very interesting.</p>

<p>Now I remember my favorite lines from the movie: "You know Jesus?"
<br>"Know him?  Shit, nigga owes me twelve bucks!"</p>
