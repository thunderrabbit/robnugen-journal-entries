<p class=date>10:32am CDT Tuesday 20 August 2002</p>

<p>Went with Elise to get her bike fixed (just needed to tighten the
shifter) and then found a correctly sized bolt of hardened steel to
replace the one that broke out from under my bike seat.  29 cents plus
tax.</p>

<p>Drove by Tomball High School, the mammoth monstrosity of a school
that used to be small and cute to see if Mr Bandecca was there.  "He
left a long time ago" (years).  "Mr Reagh?" "no" "Mr Hamm?"  "He
retired last year."  "Mrs Roach?"  "Yes."  "Twitchell?" "No; she
teaches at the college now."</p>

<p>"So Mrs Roach is here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but she's in a class and you can't go visit her now.  She'll
be done at 2:30."</p>

<p>"What about between classes?"</p>

<p>"We have block schedule now.  The class ends at 2:30."</p>

<p>I left her a note and will go back at 2:30.</p>

<p>Elise and I scavanged for lunch and Elise was eating a cold pancake
from yesterday with almond butter on it.  Her mom walked by and was
all, "have a seat," in a way that sounded like, "we have to talk about
something that you did."  But she was just telling her to sit down to
eat.  What the fuck is that all about?  We're just grazing.  No
company to impress.  Damn.</p>

<p>Elise was like, "okay" and didn't do it.  At least she didn't do
it.  One day she'll just say no.</p>
