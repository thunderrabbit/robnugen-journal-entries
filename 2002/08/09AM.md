<title>Kim's site</title>
<p class=date>11:57am CDT Friday 9 August 2002</p>

<p>Been working on Kim Sawyer's site this morning.  Actually just
composing an email of suggested course of action to take on the site.</p>

<p>Got a call from Beth at a Locator Service in California.  She was
looking for a (former?) neighbor of the Bibby's, who is entitled to
some class action lawsuit settlement.  Nice.</p>
