Rob, 

reading your email i cried again.  i saw kris today and to be able to
reflect on old rally memories is amazing, but he doesn't knwo anything
about now.  only you have that bond with me, it seems, and it is
completely unbreakable.

it's really weird to think of the past few years, and to really
realize how much of myself has beAn and still feels invested in YRUU.
i don't know if i have done as much as i wanted to do, but i will
leave happy with what i have done.

we have both changed so much since so long ago.  i bet i am the only
yruuer that remembers you with long hair.  but *of course* other than
physically, our life ambitions have changed so much as well.  not to
think we have grown away from YRUU but that we are branching away, and
starting new experiences.  thats hard.

i guess i asked you if you were laughing because i didn't assume that
you would ever feel safe crying in front of me, because you hadn't
before.  Though i know that is not the reason, it meant a lot to me.

thanks for sending that to me.  you really did make me feel like i had
made an impact for the first time.  so few times in my life have i
recieved that kind of closure from an experience, and to have it come
from someone i truly love so much, meant more than anything.

thank you.

i love you.

smile,

me
