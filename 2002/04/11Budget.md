HI

I make $48,000 per year, and on my last pay stub, I
netted $1361.20 out of
$2000 gross.   $260.80 to SEP, the rest to federal
taxes.

I owe $5360 on credit cards.


I haven't worked out a budget, but I'll guess at one
now:

per month:

     $760 for rent
      $30 for phone  (cell only, no landline)
      $30 for utilities
     $120 for groceries (estimated)
     $120 for fun (estimated)
      $15? laundry
    -------
    $1075


My short term goal includes leaving work next year
and travelling to Japan
to work.

I apparently need like $5000 cash to get set up over
there, but that's
without knowing anyone who already lives there.  I
know some people; I'll
continue to research that.


Thanks!

- Rob
