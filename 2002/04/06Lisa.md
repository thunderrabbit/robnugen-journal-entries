<p>I really love her smile.  I'm developing a crush on Lisa a bit. big hugs
and big smiles and still perfectly innocent, at least on the outside.  I
know she has a kid or kids; it sounds like she's divorced her husband, but I
don't have that confirmed yet. </p>

<p>I look forward to getting to know her more.</p>

<p class=date>10pm Tuesday 9 April 2002</p>

<p>Lisa is a physical therapist.  When I told her I had some back
soreness, Lisa encouraged me to look into yoga to help solve that.
Quite synchronous with Catherine, so I decided to follow through with
Catherine's offer.</p>

<p>At the end of the weekend, Lisa and I sat together during the
church service Sunday morning.  We flirted a bit; shared hymnal during
singing, rocked back and forth a bit while seated, brushing shoulders
together.</p>

<p>My ride to the airport was way earlier than I wanted it to be; I
wanted to talk to her.  But oh well; there will be other times.</p>
