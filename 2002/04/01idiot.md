<p>D is an idiot.  Why am I so short tempered with him?  How can he
be so old and so dumb all at once?  how does this serve me to be
pissed at his ineptness?</p>

<p>I am just trying to get some work done around here and he's fucking
around with the phone system that we've had for over a year and he
still can't figure it out.  And I'm not talking about how to set up a
conference call with someone or how to transfer someone to voice mail,
not that those are hard to do, but I'm talking about fucking hanging
up the fucking phone.  The speakerphone in this case.  How can he not
know how to use and hang up the speakerphone?  Oh and when he was
paged, he said hello and they couldn't hear him so the instant obvious
no-fucking-shit solution is to click the mic button.  And then to hang
up, click the hangup button.</p>

<p>fuck!</p>

<p>Why am I so worked up about this?</p>
