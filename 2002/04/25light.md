<p><a href="https://www2.alzado.net">Vectorial Elevation</a> is an
interactive artwork designed to transform the Artium Square in
Vitoria-Gasteiz, capital city of the Basque Country, Spain.</p>

<p>Using a three dimensional interface this web site allows you to
design a light sculpture with 18 robotic searchlights located around
the Square. A web page is made for each participant with photos from 4
webcams. The piece will be live from April 22 until May 5, 2002 to
coincide with the opening of the Basque Museum of Contemporary Art
ARTIUM.</p>
