The idea of extending SF to train the ears and not
just the eyes is quite
interesting.

There's a long history in YRUU of Silent Football
(long in YRUU terms), and
different districts are pretty passionate about
their specific variants of
the rules, which only slightly deviate from district
to district.

In this district, we made up wormholes, and the
foot-motions (analogous to
hand motions).. These have not spread to other
districts yet.

Also in this district, Nick Carter made up Mister
Dick Tater and its
variants as acceptable names for the dictator.  I
don't know if that has
made it to other districts,

Oh my gosh! We forgot to sing Ants and Cheese for
you guys at closing
circle!!!!!!!!!!  (*)

Ahem, I don't know if the name variants have made it
to other districts, and
I don't know if other districts made up that rule in
parallel, but I do
specifically remember being at First Church Austin
for the YAC restructuring
meeting in 1998(?) when Nick made up the rule.

There has been another game variant designed but
never fully played:  Silent
Moose Balls, where everyone has a color-animal name
like Blue Moose or
Yellow Robin or Spotted Tiger or Yellow Black
Panther, and the dictator is
named Farmer Dictator.  This game is played only
verbally using walkie
talkies to describe the actions.

"Roger, Yellow Black Panther, I have received Yellow
Black Panther's fwap
and I am now zooming to Plaid Platypus..."  etc.

like hillbillys:

    Ants and Cheese and Ants and Cheese!
    Ants and Cheese and Ants and Cheese!
    Ants and Cheese and Ants and Cheese!
    Ants and Cheese and Ants and Cheese!
    Ants and Cheese and Ants and Cheese!
    Ants and Cheese and Ants and Cheese!
    Yahoo!!  Yahoo!!!  (firing fake pistols into the sky)

  Hi Rob,
  Looking forward to hearing about future booboos. 
I am still sore from
Sunday's game, but the goal makes it a sweet kind of
soreness.  Actually I'm
home with wicked intestinal stuff.  This year I am
working with preschoolers
who can pass around a plague in one circle time.  I
got tagged, and I'm it
today.  I made it in to an early meeting but quickly
realized I wouldn't
make it through the day.  So I'm home lounging about
between the computer
and the hammock in the back yard.

  Hey, do you ever use IM on AOL, or just tell it to
get your email and sign
off?

  Yes, I use IM.  My kids are better at it than me. 
They'll have 10
conversations going at once.
  ll put your name on my buddy list and if you're
ever on line while I am we
can chat, that would be nice.

  I have been thinking about SF.  It's more
interesting now that I've read
your journal entries.  I think you use it for many
purposes, but one is to
test what is exceptable, like the worm hole idea. 
You're right, we had no
trouble imagining that.  Probably 30 years ago, kids
would not have been
able to use the idea so readily.  Worm holes are
supposedly unstable (on
Star Trek anyway) I wonder how that can be
incorporated into the game.  You
could also use the game to train other senses.  Like
playing with eyes
closed and having to hear or feel for the moves.

  Love and a hug,
  Lisa
