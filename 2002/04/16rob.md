Unbreakable.

When I look back on my time at University of Houston, I wonder if I
could have done more - met more people, made more of a positive impact
on the campus, climbed more buildings, joined more clubs, been featured
more times in the newspaper and yearbook.....   I see this as analogous
to you wondering if you have done as much in YRUU as you wanted to.

I know that at the time I felt like I was doing *so* *much*.  I finally
just have to trust that I did everything perfectly.

It's difficult for me as well to leave YRUU.  But you helped me
understand that to *not* travel would detriment YRUU.  I would be
leading by example a life of non-ambition.  Ultimately, that would be a
great sadness in my life.

A couple of years ago, I wondered "how can I possibly *ever* leave
YRUU?"  "How can I arbitrarily say, 'these youth get the full Rob
experience; you guys still in YRUU will just have to suffer.' ??" and
that one is subtitled, "how can I be so egotistical to think that it's
a great privledge for youth to be in YRUU with me?"

Yes, I have certainly grown.

I feel safer crying around you than in the YRUU community.  That was
the bigger stretch for me.  But it was absolutely so important for me
to let you understand my emotions that crying in front of the rest of
YRUU didn't matter.

And it's not so much that I have a concern about crying in front of
YRUU as a whole, but that I was so blatantly crying specifically with
Bryn.  That I have willingly, welcomingly let Bryn have such a huge
effect in my life.


Here's one more:  when we were in London, and I hurt my ankle, I
stuffed my sadness all day (without realizing it).  At the end of the
night, I hobbled upstairs to Graham's room and just bawled on his bed. 
I was so distraught over having apparently negatively affected your and
Tanja's day (*).  I believe at that moment, I would have been willing
to cry in front of you, but not as much in front of Tanja.  The real
issue for me was crying in front of others in the household.

(*) I trust/recognize now that your day was affected, but not
negatively.  It was just a day with a different story than was expected
earlier in the day.

You've had such a positive impact on my life that I'm still wearing the
ring.

I love you.
