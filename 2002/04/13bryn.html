<p class=date>9pm ish</p>

<p>Bryn and I were sitting next to one another looking at her pictures
of London and Paris when the lights went out as we were beckoned to
the mass wedding.</p>

<p>Not an *actual* wedding, but an invitation for each person to honor
others in friendship - these incredible bonds that YRUU makes
possible.</p>

<p>This activity started in Plano a few years ago, and they've held an
anniversary each year afterward.  Since YRUU has such a high turnover
rate, most youth here now weren't at the original event, making
anniversaries a bit silly, so this year, another mass wedding.</p>

<p>We were in the circle and Bryn asked if I would marry her.
"Absolutely," I smiled.</p>

<p>Doug Strong introduced the ceremony, then invited individuals who
were marrying themselves to place left arm on right shoulder and right
arm on left shoulder.</p>

<p>Pairs of people were invited to put one hand on each others
shoulder, and groups of people to form a group hug.  Then people who
intended to marry everyone come to the middle into the light.</p>

<p>Bryn and I faced each other with hands on shoulders and were
approached by Mike and Lisa to be a foursome.  Bryn looked to me,
asking with her eyes.  I was all, "ummmememrrr," keeping my hands on
Bryn's shoulders.  It was so hard to turn them down, and I certainly
didn't do it cleanly, but we remained a couple and Mike and Lisa
joined the marry-everyone group when that option was offered.</p>

<p>Doug invited us to share with one another our passions.</p>

<p>"Travel, Dance, Painting, YRUU, smiles," me.</p>

<p>"Travel, family, love, swinging in a park," she.</p>

<p>We all had been given inexpensive little gold rings.  When
instructed, Bryn put hers on my left pinky finger.  I chose her right
ring finger.  Some more words from Doug and then, "I now pronounce you
married!"</p>

<p>And we hugged so big and I just started to cry.</p>

<p>"Are you laughing?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Cried and cried for so much connection with Bryn and life and love
and for five incredible years of knowing, loving, supporting,
encouraging, teaching each other.</p>

<p>People came up to me and Bryn, all "are you okay?"  "Yes" and
(thumbs up) and Simon wanted to hug Bryn cause she was crying.. and he
innocently asked what was wrong.</p>

<p>I answered.  "This has been like me and Bryn's Senior circle We are
leaving YRUU soon, and have enjoyed five incredible years together.
Bryn is going to school in August, and next year I'm going to
Japan."</p>

<p>Simon was all, "no; you can't leave!"</p>

<p>"You'll go too," I hugged him bigly.  "Anywhere you want, you can
go."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Later, Ian was all, "thank you for being so awesome at Fort Worth
Rally."</p>

<p>I thanked him for the blessing and the opportunity to be there for
him. </p>
