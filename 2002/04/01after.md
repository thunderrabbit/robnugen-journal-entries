<p class=date>9:01 pm Monday 1 April 2002</p>

<p>Tom and Jon checked out of I-group tonight.</p>

<p>Robin, Dennis, and I were the onlly ones left tonight.</p>

<p class=date>6:55 am 2-4-02</p>

<p>I went to Wende's to pick up stuff from her, and I had a heavy feeling of
sadnes while there.  I didnt really have an idea of what it was about.  I
told her that Tom and Jon left I group, something else, and then mentioned
that Erika came to lunch toda and I thought that I would get to hang out
with her, but I didn't.  And I really cried a significant amount about that.
It tok some effort for me to just stay in the emotion and experience it as
opposed to being all, 'how can I be so sad about that?'</p>

<p>Wende asked if she could give me some fedback: 'mostly, I just hear that
you are tired.'</p>

<p>'The truth is that when I said I was up late last night, I meant I was up
until 4:45am.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Talking to Kristen and Catherine at Biba's.'    and then, 'thank you for
listening to me.'</p>

<p>'Sometimes it's hard to listen because I'm afraid you'll say, 'and then
we kissed,' or something.'</p>

<p>'I hear you.  At this point, it really doesn't look like that's going to
happen.   So far since I broke up with you I have broken up with Dude's
friend Amy, I think I've broken up with Lee-eh, and I broke up maybe with
someone else.'</p>

<p>'One day you will learn that you don't have to be with someone to be
worthy'  or something like that.</p>

<p>- - - - - -</p>

<p>I got to sleep around 11:30pm</p>
