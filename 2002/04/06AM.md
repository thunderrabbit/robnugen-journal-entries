<p>I'm taking Tennessee (at least Memphis) off the list of places I
can live because it's sooooo dry.  At least it's dry inside the
church.  My sinuses are totally clogged and lips would be chapped if
not for copious amounts of watermelon lip stuff. Although I've heard
that if I were to spend couple weeks in a dry climate, my body would
get used to the lack of humidity.</p>

<p>I don't really remember my dreams.  I only remember that I had
dreams.</p>

<p>We're playing Mental Clue..  After the first round, it was Sean's
turn again.  Sean looked contemplatively at Richard.</p>

<p>'Do you have any sevens?'</p>

<p>Funny.</p>
