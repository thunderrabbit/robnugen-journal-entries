<p>As I drove from Kinko's to Sally's NIN "closer" was on 94.9, the
radio station I found in San Diego.  When I called her number, I could
hear her actual phone ringing; her apartment is visible from the front
of the building.  Either that, or in an incredible irony, someone
else's phone rang exactly the same times as the speaker's phone rang
on the keypad on multiple times that I dialed.  I'm getting closer to
saying HI to Sally...</p>

<p class=date>4:36pm</p>

<p>Made it!  They were out riding bikes for an hour and had just
arrived back when I tried calling again.  We're going swimming now!
I'm hoping to get some just Rob-n-Sally time esp. so I can inquire
about last night's apparent wackiness.</p>
