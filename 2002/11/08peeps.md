<p class=date>10:06pm CST Friday 8 November 2002</p>

<p>Laura, Skyler, Kate, Graham all arrived and scooped up Jack after a
small feeding frenzy (Laura and Skyler (who wrote "sorry about this"
on the empty milk jug and put it back in the fridge)) a gossip session
(Kate, Laura, Jack), a URL chat (Graham and me), and a pact (all but
me).</p>

<p>I've gotten my comments being saved I think, but not 100% tested.</p>
