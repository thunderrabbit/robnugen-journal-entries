<p>Rockfacejack had a <a

today on LJ.  I solved it by entering all the names of the birds in
google, and clicking [I'm Feeling Lucky] to get <a
href="http://www.50states.com/bird/">this page</a>.</p>

<p>I knew from yesterday that he had been talking about certain
states.  And the birds linked them all.</p>
