<p>At the movies watching the slide show advertising before <em>The
Ring</em>.  Jack is at <em>Bowling for Columbine</em>.  Janette and I
are here.</p>

<p>I'm going to attempt writing during the movie (if there are any
good parts to write about) with my screen off.  Like the brightness
turned all the way down.</p>
