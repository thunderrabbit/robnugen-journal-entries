<p>Livin' it up in the Hotel California...</p>

<p>That was the most comfortably I've slept so far this trip.  It was
definitely warm warm warmer, though I didn't make it all night without
my sleeping bag.</p>

<p>I'm going to ride my bike back to Sally's apartment and see if she
is home.  Actually I'm going to ride around a while and maybe find
this elusive Kinko's and then visit her; give her a bit more time to
sleep in on Saturday.</p>

<p>But first, I'll describe what I see.</p>

<p>I'm parked in a parking area for about 50 cars.  There are ducks
swimming in shallow water to my right with little penninsulas sporting
sand and some prickly looking bushy plants (2 feet tall).  Past the
ducks to my right the bay extends for a mile before being surrounded
by a 100 foot bluff with trees and houses on top.</p>

<p>In front of me I see bushes.  They are right here in the parking
lot and block my view of the bay.</p>

<p>To my left I see a rocky faced bluff facing the bay.  It looks
about 100 feet tall with big trees on top.</p>

<p>To my left left is the parking lot and a bluff behind it.</p>

<p>Overhead the sky is blue with little fluffy clouds and a jet
corridor as they keep flying overhead.  Temperature is quite
comfortable, like 75 degrees.</p>

<p>Perfect.</p>
