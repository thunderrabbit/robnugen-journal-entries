<p>It's hard for me to be non flirtatious with Sally while she's got a
boyfriend.  She's all smoochy on him and saying nice stuff "what would
I do without you?" and "Aw, Rick, you're an angel.." when he does nice
stuff.</p>

<p>But it's not my time right now.</p>

<p>This makes me realize that I'm not loving her unconditionally.  I'm
not 100% happy that she is happy.</p>

<p>I'm open to learning whatever lesson this has for me.</p>

<p>I'm feeling tired now; I don't know if this is my way of checking
out of the situation or what.</p>

<p>I wonder if I'll react by being extra flirtatious when he's gone.
Yikes.  I better not do that.  Better to sleep than that.</p>
