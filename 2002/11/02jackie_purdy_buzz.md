<p>Wow.  I checked in with Josephine and learned that Jackie Purdy has
selected me to shave her head with my clippers.  What a wonderful
blessing!  I called Jackie and confirmed a time - 6pm tonight at the
Bibby's.</p>

<p>I asked Johnny if I could get off work at that time, and he seemed
really impressed that I asked ahead of time instead of just telling
him at 6pm, "I'm leaving now," or worse, simply leaving without saying
bye.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Okay.  Perfect timing as Jackie and I drove up literally at the
same moment.</p>

<p>I asked how she was doing, to get a gauge on whether or not we
should do this.  She said, "excited."</p>

<p>I took a shower while Josephine <a

<p>Jackie got nervous and a bit giddy.  We cheered her on with her
decision and she took the first wack at a braid.  Jackie, Josephine,
Jack, and I each cut off one braid.</p>

<p>The funniest thing (besides the whole thing) was Jack, when at this
point he said, "Okay, are you sure you wanna go through with this?
This is your <a

chance</a>."</p>

<p>Hahahahaha!</p>

<p>We all agree that her new do looks <a
