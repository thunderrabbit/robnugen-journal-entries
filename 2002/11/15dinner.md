<p class=date>7:15pm CST Friday 15 November 2002</p>

<p>Just finished dinner at an asian restaurant.  One day I'll be able
to distinguish Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc nationalities.</p>

<p>Annie (who it turns out I met at Youth Council (and who I
recognized but wondered if I was getting her mixed up with Micaela in
my brain)) and Mathew are the youth advisor trainers for this
weekend.  Steve picked them up at the airport and they joined us for
dinner.</p>

<p>J N-P funded the meal of Deluxe Dinner For Four + a vegetable fried
rice + broccoli + assorted appetizers.  Yummy.</p>

<p>Annie ripped out the part of the paper placement that contained the
picture and description of The Rat, her chinese zodiac sign.</p>

<p>I collected the fortunes from fortune cookies.</p>

<p>I also piled all the remaining food (except for the plate with
those dark red crazy hot peppers) into a box for people (Fred and me)
to chow later.</p>

<p>Very thankful for free food!</p>
