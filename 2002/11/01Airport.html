<p>Took Janette and Charity to the airport today.  Lots of turns and
stopsigns to get there a sneaky way, but I don't think it was shorter
than just driving down Mockingbird.  I was able to get back in 15
minutes, while I think it took 20 minutes to get there.. Anyway, who
cares..  they got to the airport on time.</p>
