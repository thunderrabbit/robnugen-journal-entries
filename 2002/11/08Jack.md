<p>Showed Jack what I've done so far on the comment entry thing.  It's
1/3 done i'm guessing, not counting creating a concept of logging in.</p>

<p>Jack and I have just arrived at the Wolf Shop, a tad early so we're
chillin' outside.</p>

<p>Ann just drove up.  Jack is working with her today.</p>

<p>Hector sounds like he's drunk today, but sometimes it's hard to
tell with him.  I asked where he was going today (does he want a ride
with me to prestonwood, and he was all, "I'M GOin' with JOHNny to the
WHITE house...."  and he meant warehouse, but it sure sounded like
whitehouse.</p>
