<p>Right now I'm driving on divided highway I-20, two lanes each
direction, mowed grass in the median, with overcast sky and a couple
long winged birds floating around over rolling seas of trees, maybe
oak or something else generally round with slightly off-green leaves
with some dark green patches on the hillsides and pear cacti visiting
the sides of the roadway in great herds and sometimes solitary
sentinels, keeping a watch for the others.</p>
