<p>Leaving now.  1800 miles on my adventure so far.</p>

<p class=date>11:52pm</p>

<p>Holy shit.  So far I really like California.  Really Really
Really.</p>

<p>Granted, I've only seen it at night, with therefore limited
traffic, but I love the terrain!!!  And the beach is right next door!
And at any moment, the biggest earthquake ever could shake the shit
out of everything...  Wow!</p>

<p class=date>1:26am</p>

<p>I'm here; I overshot the exit a bit and had to wind my way back to
her place.  Took a long time to park, and I dialed the apt number on
the thing but no answer.</p>

<p>But then, the weirdest thing; Sally was talking to her guy behind
me; he was dropping her off and they were having a fight of sorts it
seemed.  I'm *sure* it was her, but I didn't want to interrupt their
deal, but then they drove off together.  So I'm writing this little
snippet.  I wonder if it really was her; I'll find out within no too
long I'm sure.</p>
