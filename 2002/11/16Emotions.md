<p>I realize that I'm acting exceptionally energetic and outgoing
partially to block some of the sadness that I feel as this is my
second to last event in the district.</p>

<p>When just relaxing listening to conversation or discussion, my legs
are both bouncing or or otherwise moving, nervous energy that I know
no other way to release.  I don't really feel safe enough to just lay
it all out, nor do I think this is really the right space to do
that.</p>

<p>Interesting.</p>

<p>Interesting that some people are drinking coffee to wake up.  I
don't really understand drinking coffee.  Bleah.</p>
