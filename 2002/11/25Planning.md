<p>Slowly</p>

<p>Slowly</p>

<p>Slowly I am planning my trek out west.  I feel so stuck, with so
much shit to do first; gotta get organized, prioritized, normalized,
coordinized, settled before I go.</p>

<p>I'm on the verge of engaging my Cleaning Mood, which basically
throws a lot of shit away and turns upside-down and shakes the
Etch-A-Sketch of my life.  This seems similar to Jackie's emotionless
machine get shit done mood.</p>

<p>I got maps from AAA.  I mailed Wende her card thing on recycled
paper.  The entire trip driving I had Eminem on full blast,
rap-yelling along with him.  I know a lot of lyrics on the tape I've
got.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Go.</p>

<p class=date>8:26pm</p>

<p>Lots of cookies eaten, lots of philosophy discussed, lots of steps
taken as Janette and I walked to Whole Foods to get sea salt for
Josephine's piercing.</p>

<p>I ranted to Janette about my life and how big a chunk I seem to
have bitten off this time around, how I have the entire world open to
me yet I seem afraid to take a simple trek out west across the states
(my own manifest destiny??)... that I just want to learn languages and
learn cultures and meet a bunch of people around the world and be all
wazzap in different languages and all that.  Just to get a sense of
what is out there in the world.</p>

<p>That I have no fear of dying, only a fear of being alone.</p>

<p class=date>9:08pm</p>

<p>I have just about finished packing.  Just need to pack my
nonperishable food and do a bit of laundry and toss bags into the
car.  Oh, and my bike.  Then I'm set.</p>

<p>I'm taking far less stuff on this trek than my eastern state trek.</p>
