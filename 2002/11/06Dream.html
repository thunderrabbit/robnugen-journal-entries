<p class=date>7:03am CST Wednesday 6 November 2002</p>

<p><p class=dream>With an ethnically diverse group of people at a
SWUUSI Young Adult type situation, talking in a cabin in the woods
after having witnessed a guy who was in charge of food try to fund
something by stealing the remainder of alcohol from a party next door
and everyone got mad at him for being so silly and thoughtlesss about
this community.</p>

<p class=dream>As i walked upstairs with my plate/bowl of food,
someone said, "so Rob," and I was surprised that they knew my name,
"how do you rectify the fact that Cornfed is going to japan next year
with your first impression that he was just a testosterone driven
hick?"</p>

<p class=dream>"That's a good question," I stalled.  "Hearing that
sotry from him definitely changed my view of who he must be.  I was
quite impressed to hear that and I wold like to get to know him a lot
better now.</p>

<p class=dream>interesting thing is that the woman who asked m e was
referring to Cornfed having gone to Japan during the war, and I was
referring to him going next year to teach English.</p>
