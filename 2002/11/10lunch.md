<p class=date>2:06pm CST Sunday 10 November 2002</p>

<p>Invited to lunch with Asha, Kristen, Laura, Meredith (abc order) at
Luby's.  So great to see such what good friends they are.  Learned
that Laura went to Costa Rica as an exchange student for six weeks
this summer.</p>

<p>They are quite silly, with Kristen spilling ice and Laura's phone
saying "LAURA POOPS IN THE WOODS" (thanks to Kristen probably) and all
variety of stuff.</p>

<p>Great weekend, and now I'm going to Bibby's to shower and such and
then watch <em>8 Mile</em> with Janette.</p>
