<p>Lotta interesting things at work today.  Got to see the warehouse,
which amounts to a big big metal shack with a gate.  After Vince
wasn't brash enough, Charles drove backwards like a bulldozer through
a pile of garbage to get the Ryder truck up to the gate.</p>

<p>Got to see the God Dome, I mean Prestonwood Church in Plano.  Big.
We're helping set up their stage for Christmas.</p>

<p>Vince drove me and Jeramiah back to the warehouse to get stairs,
but we couldn't find the stairs.  Turns out it was the wrong
warehouse.  Johnny just asked us to get two 6x6 foot pallets while we
were there, and at the same time-ish, two cats from off the street
offered to help us load stuff.  They loaded the pallets for us and
moved a set of stairs back, which we had moved while looking for the
correct stairs.  I gave them each $1 for their efforts (10 minutes of
work) and they whined until I gave them another $1 to split between
them.  Shit.</p>

<p>Then when Vince got back in the truck for us to drive away, it
wouldn't go into drive.  Just stuck in park.  Put the parking brake
on, the pedal brake on, turned the engine off and back on... nothing.
Couldn't get it out of park.  Until suddenly he was able to get it out
of park.  Weird.  I'm glad we didn't have to call Ryder peeps to come
help us.</p>
