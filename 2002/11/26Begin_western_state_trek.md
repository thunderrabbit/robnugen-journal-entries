<p>Not slowly, not quickly.  Just steadily meditatively preparing,
collecting my stuff, cleaning the kitchen, adding Josephine's goodbye
note to my scrapbook.</p>

<p>I plan to visit Balmorhea State Park first, I think.  Down by El
Paso, but closer to Marfa.</p>

<p class=date>11:30am</p>

<p>Okay.  I've traveled zero miles so far on my western state trek.
Here we go!</p>

<br>hi, <br>
<br>
patrick and i put up the christmas tree lastnight.  its fake.  then, this morning zack and i put on the lights and ornaments that we had.<br>
<br>
zack talked a lot about what they use to do with his mom.  it seemed to do him some good.   then, we whent shopping and bought more ornaments for 1.00.  they are cute and make the tree look perfect.  the tree colors are red and gold.  and we have white and green lights.  the green ones make it look more alive!  <br>
<br>
i love it!<br>
<br>
