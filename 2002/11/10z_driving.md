<p>I have never been so scared and laughed so much at the same time as
just now as janette was directing me while I was drivng around the
lake (very limited traffic) with my eyes closed.</p>

<p>Oh my god that was so fucking weird!</p>

<p>Try it sometime, but be careful and don't sue me if you crash.
That was wild.</p>
