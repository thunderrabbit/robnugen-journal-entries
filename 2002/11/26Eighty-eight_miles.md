<p class=date>1:19pm CST Tuesday 26 November 2002</p>

<p>Have driven 88.2 miles so far.  I'm at a rest area just inside the
Palo Pinto county line.  Have seen some NO TOLERANCE signs regarding
speed limit enforcement.  Hadn't seen such in Texas before now, only
in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Been listening to my new Eminem tape with 8 Mile and some of his
older shit on it.</p>

<p class=date>1:31pm</p>

<p>That was the restarea where I met the guy cleaning the sink who
hasn't lived outside of Texas, but has visited Texas City, Carlsbad
(he says the Caverns are deeper now and take all day to go down and
get back up), Oklahoma, and was born in Fort Stockton.  Lives now in
Stephenville.</p>

<p>It's 105 miles to Abilene from here.  540 some odd miles to El
Paso, so about that to Balmorhea; dunno if I'll make it that far
tonight or not.</p>

<p>Oh, and I climbed around on the concret benches a bit, didn't use
my hands to balance sidways along a wall while facing the roof/wall of
the shelter, turned and jumped to another platform.  Good little bit
of exercise before I begin again.</p>

<p class=date>2:01pm</p>

<p>Apparently plenty of space for a radio station out here 75 miles
east of Abilene.  I only found 1 station across the entire band of FM
and AM.  It was not a hip hop station.</p>

<p class=date>2:05pm</p>

<p>Oh, nevermind.  I didn't have my radio's antenna up.  Two FM
stations, neither of which is hip hop, and plenty of AM stations, one
of which broadcasts Dr Laura right now.</p>
