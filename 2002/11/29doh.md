<p>D'oh!</p>

<p>So, this is the part of my adventure where non-planning ahead makes
things interesting.  Karina isn't home; I'm guessing she is gone for
the weekend since she didn't reply to my emails today.  I left one of
my adventure cards at her door.</p>

<p>I parked Scott in a little tiny space (for me)!  Parallel parking,
aww yeah.</p>

<p>Had to pay a dollar to call Sally since my cell phone battery is
dead and neither of my chargers will charge it.  I dunno what the
problem is.  Left a message with Sally and now I'm going to drive up
almost to Los Angeles to try to find her.  I have her address, but
she's not home as of the time I called, but she often goes out, so she
could just be out on a date or some such.</p>

<p>I hate to just drop in on her with no notice; my emails still
aren't going out... so at least she's gotten one phone call.</p>

<p>Driving around San Diego has been exciting.  Like in Houston,
everyone drives like maniacs, and there's hills everywhere, which
makes the streets do weird things unlike in Houston.  And since it's
all new to me, and dark, and the streets are wet, it's all the more
exciting!</p>
