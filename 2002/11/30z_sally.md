<p>Wow it's later than I guessed.</p>

<p>Once Rick left, Sally and I have been talking for hours on her
couch.  So great to share stories and tell the same story of her
crisis last night from different points of view.</p>

<p>Fond memories exchanged of visiting her in Austin for her thesis
presentation and how much my presence meant to her.</p>

<p>I told her the whole behind the scenes story that was going on
during my eastern state trek.</p>

<p>Summary of my YRUU advising career, though we got sidetracked
before I could get caught up to missing San Antonio Rally.</p>

<p>hugs hugs hugs hugs hugs hugs hugs before I sent Sock Monkey to
tuck her into bed for the night.  I have a warm sleeping bag situation
on the soft couch.  So thankful for a real place to sleep tonight.</p>
