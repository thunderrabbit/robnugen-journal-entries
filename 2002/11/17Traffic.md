<p>I've been in bumper to bumper traffic for the past hour.  From the
point where it started, I would normally have been home in 20
minutes.  But not this time.  I just spent 20 minutes on the phone
with Josephine as she determined with the Texas Department of Public
Safety website that there was an accident ahead of me, but it's now
cleared.  So hopefully things will speed up a bit soon.  But they
haven't yet.</p>

<p>For an hour Scott has been either in first gear or neutral,
sometimes with the parking brake on.</p>

<p>The traffic snarl was due to a van stalled in the right center lane
of the four lane freeway.</p>
