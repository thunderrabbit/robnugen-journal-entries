<p class=date>6:35pm CST Sunday 10 November 2002</p>

<p>I went north to 635 and I-35-ish to see Ma who was staying up with
the minister from Horizon UU.  Told her the whole wacked out situation
and its latest twists and turns.</p>

<p>She suggested that something that might look bad is that all of my
journal entries are about YRUUers.</p>

<p>If all of my journal entries were in fact about YRUUers then I
might understand such a concern.  If all my journal entries about my
social activities were about YRUU then I might understand such a
concern.</p>

<p>How ironic that people are using my website against me.  Freedom of
speech at its fucking best.</p>

<p>I'm back at home in Dallas, (I'm just going to call the Bibby's
home until further notice) and Janette (not a YRUUer) and I are going
to see <em>8 Mile</em>, a movie that does not have any YRUUers in it,
and probably won't have any YRUUers in the audience.</p>
