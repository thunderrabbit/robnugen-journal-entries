<p>Super thanks to Wende for having the ultra foresight to create
ROB'S RESCUE KIT, consisting of first aid supplies and such.  She's
the best.</p>

<p>At work, while my higher self was saying, <em>get some gloves
on</em>, I cut my finger slightly, but effectively enough to get blood
splots on the front of my shirt.  Eight splots.</p>

<p>Just got done with work, the last hour of which consisted of taking
Ivory home; he was pretty much sick all day today, despite eating four
hamburgers at Wendy's.</p>
