<p>Funny things so far at Fall Conference:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>During opening circle, we were asked to say one thing that we
liked.  I <em>knew</em> Josephine would pick pink.  Laura or Jack (I
think), said "the color, not the artist."  I said, "I like Eminem, and
M&M's." When it was Graham's turn, he said, "I like to think that
people will have a good time this weekend."  Brilliant!</p></li>

<li><p>Near the beginning of All My Friends and Neighbors, Erica Nagel
didn't get to  move for several rounds.</p></li>

<li><p>Edward refused to play All My Friends and Neighbors, hollering,
"I'm disabled!!"  His left thumb is severely bruised (he dropped a
weight on it) and blue.  The nail will likely come off soon.  I
suggested that he use a small drill (dremel) to drill a hole in the
nail to release the pressure.</p></li>

<li><p>During the meet people game, where pairs of people introduced
one another, I introduced Anthony, who's from here, wants to move to
Italy and open a Judo Dojo, a restaurant where he will be the main
chef, and a UU church.  But actually he wants to play professional
soccer.  He has the best answer for what to wish for if a genie gives
him one wish.  And if he could have a super power, it would be to
create fire of any temperature.</p></li>

<li><p>We never found out what that perfect wish would be.</p></li>

<li><p>I like the font on Kate's new tattoo "No one, not even the
rain, has such small hands"</p></li>

<li><p>Amy and Amy introduced one another by signing their names and
each saying "and she has the best name ever!"</p></li>

<li><p>There was certainly other funny stuff, but I've forgotten.
Good night, all.</p></li>
</ul>
