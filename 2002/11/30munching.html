<p>Munched dinner at Thaifoom (?), a Thai restaurant on (get this:)
Fashion Island.</p>

<p><em>Fashion Island</em>.</p>

<p>Fashion Island is not an island.  It's just a glorified shopping
center have I already said this?  Anyway, whatever; who cares.</p>

<p>Dinner was lovely and included sake, which was poured to
overflowing, symbolizing money is no concern.</p>

<p>I had a meal called "Evil Jungle Princess."  Basically chicken and
peanut sauce and green beans and rice.</p>
