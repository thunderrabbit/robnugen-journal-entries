<p>Finally I've gotten to see where Steve lives.  And Hillary and
Bethany and Kathy.</p>

<p>Hillary showed us her beautiful glass pieces that she's blown.  She
has made three cups, two of them with colors, and two bowls, one of
them clear.</p>

<p>Her first cup cracked a big crack down the inside, so she affected
a cracked pattern on the whole thing and resealed it.  Amazing.</p>

<p>She described in pretty good detail how the process works.  I'm so
glad that she's found something awesome that she loves to do.</p>

<p>Bethany came home while Fred and I were laughing and chowing cold
pizza with Steve down in the kitchen.  H & B were soon bickering and
sorting things out, being just like sisters should.</p>

<p>Gotta go to bed.</p>
