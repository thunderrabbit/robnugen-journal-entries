<p class=date>12:28pm CST Friday 15 November 2002</p>

<p>I'm in San Antonio at the CYA meeting.</p>

<p>My mom is here because she's a minister and has some time off
lately.  She's replacing our previous minister who recently had
twins.</p>

<p>I got Oreos in honor of Bryn and Elizabeth, for this will likely be
my last meeting in San An for a long time.</p>

<p class=date>3:30pm</p>

<p>We just took a 15 minute break.  I climbed the big tree between the
buildings and cried.  This will likely be the last time I see this
church in a really long time.</p>

<p>So many awesome memories here.  Jason and Sean wrassling on the
ground; that was the same year Erick woke up under the dome on the
playground.  Seeing Troy Scott (from my YRUU days) as a
magician/balloon artist making the most <em>incredible</em> shapes.</p>
