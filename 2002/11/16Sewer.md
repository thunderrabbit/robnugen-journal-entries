<p>Fred and I just played Sewer for the second time today.  That's the
game that Mikey Arthrell and I played at San An 2001 on the 3-D grid
shaped monkey bars on the playground.  Sewer is follow the leader on
that equipment thing without touching the ground.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, we were asked to stop because we were
disrupting the class of 3rd or 4th graders who were more interested in
watching us than in watching her teach.  Not our fault that we're
exciting, but we left anyway.</p>
