<p>I found a fresh exciting new way to shred documents that I don't
want anyone else to read.  In this case, the documents were Wende's
bank account information that was sent to me at my dad's house since
I'm still on the account.</p>

<p>I know that Wende would appreciate the account information be
destroyed.  I don't have a shredder here, but I found that putting the
paper into a sink full of hot(!) soapy water, then swishing them
around with a scrub brush does a pretty good job of rendering them
illegible.</p>
