<p>Funny:</p>

<p>After finishing my tuna and crackers lunch, I walked to the
trashcan to throw away the tuna can.  The trashcan happens to be
between two outhouses, on one side of the parking lot in which I slept
last night.</p>

<p>As I approached, one of the outhouse doors turned from IN USE to
OPEN and the guy opened the door a bit, presumably to verify the
approaching footsteps were human.  "Excuse me!"</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Can you see if there's paper in the other outhouse?"</p>

<p>"Sure."  There was not. "Nope, but I have some in my car; just a sec."</p>

<p>Thank you, Janette, from the cat stranded on the john not at The
Four Seasons.</p>
