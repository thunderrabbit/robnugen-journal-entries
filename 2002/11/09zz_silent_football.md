<p class=date>2:44am CST Sunday 10 November 2002</p>

<p>Had been talking with Steve Caldwell and Ellen, one of the advisors
from Little Rock.  Steve went to sleep about an hour ago, and I
continued chatting with Ellen, telling old talent show stories (root
beer guzzling (Austin Roth, Nick Carter, Shira, me, at OKC a couple
years back), gum chowing (Jason and me at Houston 2000 I think)) and
answering questions in general.</p>

<p>Got off onto Silent Football discussion somehow, and she asked how
to play.  I gave her quick version of the rules (and let me tell you,
if people will sit quietly and pay attention, the rules can be
described in about 5 minutes) and even described the wormholes, and
was able to show how Sam could fwap to her, and then I shrug and the
football lands on the chair. (Assuming Sam could play while snoring,
and a chair could play while just sitting there)</p>

<p>I appreciate her listening to my stories.</p>

<p>She went to bed and now I am going soon too.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to bed.  It appears that I'm the last one
standing.</p>
