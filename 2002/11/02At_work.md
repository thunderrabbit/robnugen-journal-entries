<p>At work now; been here since 10:07, according to the timeclock.  A
frustration that I've found here is getting very little direction on
some things, and lots of direction on other things.  For example, I
was asked to screw down the floor where boards were warping upward now
that they are drying after it flooded some weeks ago.  I asked how far
apart the screws should be and Johnny said "just get them down," in
his comforting smooth deep voice.</p>

<p>I grabbed some screws that looked useable, but discovered they were
too long; they hit the concrete before their heads touched the floor.
So I got the right sized screws and got to work.  Later I was informed
that I should screw the screws in at an angle, and that I should screw
in "closer to the edge" than I had been.</p>

<p>When .. nevermind; who cares.  I don't wanna focus on negativity at
work.</p>
