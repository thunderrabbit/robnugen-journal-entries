<p class=date>10:39am CST Wednesday 27 November 2002</p>

<p>Today I plan to see McDonald Observatory, Balmorhea, Carlsbad
Caverns, not necessarily in that order.</p>

<p>I'm leaving Marfa (Public Library) now.</p>

<p class=date>10:49am</p>

<p>Driving on a straight mostly flat two lane highway 17 going
presumably due north.  Flat flat flat grassy speckled with cacti
around me and not mountain ranges around, but lumps of mountains
scattered about.  Just passed Marfa municipal airport.</p>

<p class=date>11:09am</p>

<p>Have gone through Fort Davis and now am within some hilly terrain
and some trees, including this beautiful yellow tree.  Wow.</p>

<p>If it wasn't so flipping cold, I might climb this hill thing.</p>

<p class=date>11:14am</p>

<p>"Alright, that does it," I announced outloud when I turned another
corner, saw a cool rock formation and a <em>picnic table</em> and
small parking area beside it!!!</p>

<p class=date>11:38am</p>

<p>Fun fun fun climbing.  Rocks were so easily climbable.  I carried
out 6 cans/bottles from the area.  I'm thankful it is cold because I
was able to climb more easily and with fewer injuries wearing shoes
and long pants and long sleevie hoodie and gloves.</p>
