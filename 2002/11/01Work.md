<p class=date>12:04am CST Saturday 2 November 2002</p>

<p>Holy shit I'm just now getting off work.  I didn't get here until
10:30am, but Vince et. al. got here at 8:30 for 15 hours (30 mins
lunch).</p>

<p>Highlight: Joe got his head crunched by a 4 x 4 foot deck of 2 inch
steel border and 3/4 inch plywood surface.  Fortunately, it only fell
one foot before it hit his head (he was on a ladder), and only the
wooden part hit him, not the metal.</p>

<p>We barely barely barely got all the shit in the truck.</p>

<p>Side note: the truck was supposed to leave at noon, and cost Johnny
$75 per hour that it didn't leave by noon.  $75 * 12 = $900.  Wow.</p>

<p>After work I took Vince home.  Johnny gave me a tip ($20) for doing
so, as it saved him time off his trek home.</p>
