<p>Fucking great excellent awesome movie.</p>

<p>Especially if you love Eminem.</p>

<p>I loved how it seemed so fucking real all the way through (not that
I know what it's like to grow up in the 313)</p>

<p>I loved how he never fucking gave up.</p>

<p>Such a brilliant battle he did at the end.</p>

<p>I'll definitely see it again.</p>
