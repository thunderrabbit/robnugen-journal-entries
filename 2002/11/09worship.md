<p>Worship was lovely.  I cried a bit during it, thinking about how
these are the last times that I'll hear Amy on her harp for a while,
how these beautiful youth will continue to fight for the right to
play, worship, lead, learn, chill as they wish, how very soon I will
be saying my last goodbyes to some of them forever.</p>

<p>How beautiful today that I was able to handwrite both sides of a
page with answers to questions asked and questions unasked for
Leigh(sp), a new advisor.  After I expressed my appreciation for that
gift, she expressed thanks to be the recipient.</p>

<p>Fun ticklefight broke out with Katy, Susie, Joel.  Joel pinned
Susie with Katy on top of him, so I chose to join and pulled both Joel
and Katy off, and was nearly able to pull them both onto me, but
couldn't quite.  I discovered that Joel is more ticklish than Katy.
Fun stuff.</p>

<p>Maybe Silent Football now.</p>

<p>Matt and Jared just made Groovy Jice for the Arkansas youth.  Jared
drank six ladles worth, where one ladle is a single serving.</p>
