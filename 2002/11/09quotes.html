<p>I helped Amy and Josephine design the worship.  Josephine pretended
to not feel very loved, so I said, "aaww Josephine, I like you.." in a
fake mocking tone.  She goes, "thanks, whatever."  HAhahahah!</p>

<p>After Kate from Little Rock had a drink of Groovy Juice: "Takes
like shit.  Thanks." and the thanks was not meant sarcastically.</p>
