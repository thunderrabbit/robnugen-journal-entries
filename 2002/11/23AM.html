<p>Good morning.  I woke up at 7:30; part of me is tempted to just
piss around all day, but I know I must work past that to allow my
western trek to happen.</p>

<p>Okay.  I've got a pretty good start on things to do today.  Get
stamps, change oil and spark plugs in Scott, return <em>Stranger In A
Strange Land</em> (and pay the late fee), get a CD to cassette adapter
so my computer can play tunes while I'm on the road.....</p>
