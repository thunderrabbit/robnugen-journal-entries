<p>Yesterday I mostly worked, which consisted of getting a blood
blister on my finger, two splinters in my hand, bonking my head on a
truss, getting to climb onto and walk along a truss to tie a curtain
onto it, helping Janette sew the bottom of a curtain with her portable
sewing machine at Prestonwood.</p>

<p>Yesternight I read a chapter of Stranger in a Strange Land to
Janette (where Jubal tests Mike's ability to make things vanish), had
Janette get splinters out of my hand (she had Josephine do it cause
Janette couldn't see them well enough), looked for meteors for about 3
minutes until I declared it too fucking cold to be outside.</p>

<p>And, if I remember correctly, yesterday was Tammy's birthday.</p>
