<p>I'm in Abilene, or on I-20 north of Abilene's business I-20.  Just
stopped to P, get gas (for $1.399/gallon) and stretch.  It's about 40
degrees F outside.  And windy.  brrrr!  That makes me glad I'm not
doing this trek on my bike.</p>

<p>225.2 miles traveled.  I'm at a rest area just before Stink Creek
Road.  I've been drinking a lot of water.</p>
