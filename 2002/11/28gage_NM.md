<p class=date>8:57pm MST Thursday 28 November 2002</p>

<p>I'm tooo tired to make it to Tuscon tonight, which is just fine
because I've been unable to reach Jeanette on my cellie.  She
apparently has married some cat named Kim, according to my mom's
cousin Mickey.</p>

<p>So I'm at a rest stop just west of Gage, NM on I-10.  Rest stops in
New Mexico are cool because they allow a body to stay overnight.
Signs say we can't stay more than 24 hours.  That's plenty of time to
get a good night's sleep.</p>

<p class=date>9:27pm</p>

<p>There are railroad tracks behind me.  Three trains have gone by
since I've been here.  Fast trains, too.  I dunno if they're going 60
mph, but let's just say that I won't be trying to jump onto one of
these trains.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p class=date>5:05am MST Friday 29 November 2002</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>I'm still at the rest stop outside Gage.  My phone seems to have a
super tired battery.  I have to hold my car charger onto the phone to
make it charge, and even then it's not always charging.  Silly phone.
I just tried using the outlet in the restroom, but it didn't seem to
work.  Pooh.</p>

<p>1137 miles traveled since Dallas.</p>

<p>My neck muscles are sore from sleeping weirdly, and my right calf
is sore from driving.  (Scott has no cruise control)</p>

<p>Let's roll.</p>

<p>Oh, I should check Scott's oil first.</p>

<p class=date>5:21am</p>

<p>Oil is fine.  What took me the longest is opening the sealed
plastic packaging around the flashlight.</p>

<p class=date>5:36am</p>

<p>Mile marker fifty-one, I just crossed a sign that said CONTINENTAL
DIVIDE ELEV 4585 feet four five eight five.  But my road is flat flat
flat flat flat.  wierd.  I-10 west.</p>
