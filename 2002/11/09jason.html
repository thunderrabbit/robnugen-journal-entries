<p>Jason is here!!</p>

<p>Big Climb On Rob hug and funniness hearing how he carefully chose
not to barge into the meeting all "They've got it all wrong; listen to
me this is how it is.."</p>

<p>He has the fun challenge of presenting the youth opinions at the
meeting regarding the possibility of moving SWUUSI.  All of the youth
opinions are valid and beautiful.  Some are eloquently written.  Some
more passionately use first amendment rights.</p>

<p>Jason understands their points and I'm glad that such a smart
well-spoken guy as Jason will present them.  Awesome.</p>
