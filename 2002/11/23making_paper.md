<p>While grokking all that stuff, I had gone to the kitchen and found
the sink full of shredded soggy paper.</p>

<p>Short version of the story is that I threw the mess into the
blender and rolling pinned it vaguely flat on some towels on the
table.  Now it's drying on a cookie sheet.  Might take a while to dry
since there is no heat involved, but oh well.</p>

<p>Since it's Wende's account information that I blended, I'll write a
letter to her on it.</p>
