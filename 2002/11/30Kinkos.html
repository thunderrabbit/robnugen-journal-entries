<p>Wow.  Kinko's was a bit tricky for me to find.  But I found it.
Now I've got my bike locked to some steps near a sign that says</p>

<pre>
                              	   NO
                              	BICYCLES
                               SKATEBOARDS
                              	VIOLATORS
                              	 WILL BE
                               PROSECUTED
</pre>

<p>But I asked the cat at the desk and he was all, "'scoo bro."</p>

<p>So now my car is parked in a place that I don't know how long it
can stay there, my bike is parked in a no biking zone (but at least I
can see it from my vantage point)..</p>

<p>But I'm happy.</p>
