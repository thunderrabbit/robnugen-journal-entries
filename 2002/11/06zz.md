<p>Well, I'm doing better on going to bed tonight than last night
(midnight) and the night before (2am).</p>

<p class=date>11:03pm</p>

<p>As I'm falling asleep, I'm thinking of my friend Kristen who has
just passed the bar; she'll be a lawyer by the end of the month.
Super congratulations to her.</p>
