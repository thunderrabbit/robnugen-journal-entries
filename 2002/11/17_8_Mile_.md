<p>Just got back from seeing <em>8 Mile</em> with Josephine.  Jack and
Janette had come too, but the movie times didn't work out well, so
they went back home.  I am thankful to Janette for her willingness to
come pick us up after our movie.</p>

<p>I had put the tickets on my credit card, and when we refunded their
two tickets, the guy gave me cash back.  So that's a sneaky way to get
cash on my credit card without knowing the pin number.</p>

<p>The movie was great.  I was hyped during the battle scenes at the
end.  Some cat in the theater said the movie was dumb for ending the
way it did.  He just don't understand.</p>

<p>In the theater, there were two young children, like 2 or 3 years old.</p>

<p>Also, the guy in front of us answered a phone call and
<em>made</em> a phone call during the movie.  I kicked his seat
forward and then immediately felt sorry for being equally
disrespectful as he.</p>
