<p>Wow.</p>

<p>We've been playing since June.  Josephine just tonight got the
correct answer to the game of Infinite Questions that we've been
playing.</p>

<p>"The word 'aight' as spoken by John Travolta in the beginning of
<em>Pulp Fiction</em> at the world premier."</p>

<p>*Then* I realized I had approved the wrong answer; it was Samuel L
Jackson, so I told her this, then "okay start over; new game: infinite
questions."</p>

<p>"The word 'aight' as spoken by Samuel L Jackson at the world
premier of <em>Pulp Fiction</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>Oh my god that's right!!!!</em>"</p>
