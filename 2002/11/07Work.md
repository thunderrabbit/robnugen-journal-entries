<p>At Presonwood now, but I'm not here to work.  Jah Ivory took the
keys to the Ryder truck that we were loading for a different job down
at the shop.  Jah Jah called Johnny when they discovered the error.
Fortunately they called before Johnny even knew they were missing, so
we didn't waste time looking for them.  Just wasted time getting
them.</p>

<p>I did drop off Vince and Jimmy here at Prestonwood, so that was
something useful to do with my trip up here.</p>
