<p class=date>7:44pm CST Tuesday 26 November 2002</p>

<p>Skipped the picnic area idea when I found an exit indicating
Balmorhea is 37 miles away.  449 miles traveled so far.</p>

<p class=date>8:37pm</p>

<p>Have just arrived at Balmorhea.  Now I know how to spell it.  Sleep
now.</p>

<p>My computer screen is off to save battery power; fifty four minutes
left.  Um, oh my car feels quite warm right now, or warm enough to
sleep comfortably, but who knows if it will stay warm all night.  Not
me.</p>

<p>Okay, goodnight.</p>

<p class=date>9:11pm</p>

<p>Man fuck trying to sleep all crunched up in my car.  I've got my
sleeping bag on top of a picnic table now.  <em>much</em> better!!</p>

<p>Goodnight for real.</p>
