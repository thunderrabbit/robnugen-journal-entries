<p class=date>9:22pm CST Saturday 9 November 2002</p>

<p>So I went to the musical performance and found it to be jazzy and
bouncy sometimes, slow and sultry sometimes, smooth and bluesy
sometimes.  Danceable most of the times.  I whirled around a bit with
Frank and just perfectly twirled out of his hands and bowed to him
*just* as the song ended.  Couldn't have done it better had I ever
heard the song before.</p>

<p>Danced around alone for some songs, with a variety of styles (one
per song) and suddenly remembered that Claire is one of the three
chartreuse buzzards who sitting in a dead tree full of ants at San
Antonio some years ago!  So I've run around the church looking for her
and was suddenly inspired to tell Nancypant's grape joke to Heather,
the cutest chef in the world.</p>

<p>Suddenly taken by sadness and realize that all my bouncy energy may
be just covering the sadness that is burrowed within me about leaving
YRUU, possibly prematurely, and fear around my western state
adventure, which is totally ridiculously silly, but I do need to start
contacting some mofos that I think I may find along my journey.</p>

<p>Sigh.  And here I am.</p>
