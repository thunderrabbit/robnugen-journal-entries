<p class=date>2:00pm MST Friday 29 November 2002</p>

<p>I've gotten my entries syncrhonized, but no pics yet.  I have a
looming feeling that they won't get done for a while.  eek.</p>

<p>Each time I've taken a picture I've thought about the entry I'd
write with it.  Pooh.</p>

<p>Just been working on Kim's website.  Closer and closer to being
done, but not done yet.</p>

<p>Going to scope out maps and may be in San Diego tonight.</p>
