<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I have never previously heard Dr Laura.  I have read some rants
about her online, and have a sense that she stands for some things for
which I do not.</p>

<p>Now I've had confirmation, though she's not 100% wizack.  Just
mostly wack.</p>

<p class=date>2:29pm</p>

<p>Okay.  Nevermind.  She's totally fucking nutty.  Peer pressuring a
mom to get her daughter out of public school RIGHT NOW and create a
big stink about how all public schools are in cahoots with Planned
Parenthood, especially in California, to subversively take your kids
out of school against your will and without your knowledge to allow
them to do anything they want.  Harshing the mom cause she doesn't
have a cellphone and at least her new husband will teach her how to be
a good parent.</p>

<p>The mom had called complaining that the school had allowed her 13
year old to go to Planned Parenthood after the 13 year old had had sex
with someone that the mom presumes is a male.</p>

<p>Dr Laura all, "let's hope he's 4 years older than her so you can
throw him in jail.  Sue his family.  Sue the school.  Sue them and
make the biggest stink you can about this because that's the only way
that something is going to happen."</p>

<p>Dr Laura doesn't know if this woman has got the balls/means/courage
to do something effective after being pressured to get her daughter
out of school on an emotional whim.  Jeez.</p>

<p>No shit the school should allow the girl to go there.  *Obviously*
the mom doesn't know what the fuck is going on with the girl in the
first place.  (See I know, but Dr L doesn't, right?)  whatever.</p>
