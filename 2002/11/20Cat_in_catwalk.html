<p>Johnny is a pretty cool cat.  He's the owner of Wolf Company.</p>

<p>Today I was up on the catwalks and the trusses a lot.  Had some
frustration trying to get the slack removed from a rope; basically I
couldn't loosen the screw holding the right end of the rope, but I
could loosen the screw holding the wrong end of the rope.  In the
interim I tried loosening the center of the rope, which was way on the
other side of the truss, requiring me to crawl through a nice crawlway
around the back perimeter of the stage.</p>

<p>Kinda hard on the knees unless I uses yoga techniques I learned
from Catherine.</p>
