<p class=date>8:34am CST Saturday 9 November 2002</p>

<p>Kellie at beside me during breakfast, put her hand on my shoulder,
"Rob!"</p>

<p>I looked ... careful not to look at nametag... "Kellie!"</p>

<p>She introduced me to her friend Krista from Toronto who met an
um-friend online in Springfield, so she's visiting to see what's up.
Reminded me of having met Crystal at the church in Springfield.</p>

<p>I noted that Irene met Nick online and they are happily married in
Australia.  So it can happen.</p>

<p>She asked specifically how stuff was going twice of me, and the
second time I mentioned the chaos around me regarding my desired
attendance at Houston Rally.</p>
