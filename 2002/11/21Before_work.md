<p>Thanks to Janette for making breakfast for me this week.  And
sometimes lunch.</p>

<p>I cannot rap Eminem lyrics while typing.</p>

<p>There's a funeral scheduled at the church at 3pm today, so we have
to be out by 2pm.</p>

<p class=date>8:02am</p>

<p>Oh my god what is wrong with the fucking society where we have bags
and bags and bags of <em>leaves</em> to be thrown away to keep the
lawn ..  what clean?  Green?</p>

<p>Throwing away all that perfectly designed perfect fertilizer
designed by none other than five hundred million years of perfection
by Nature... Blaoouughh!!!!</p>
