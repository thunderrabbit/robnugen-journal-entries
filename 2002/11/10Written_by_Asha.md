sitting in the sanctuary at First Jefferson UUC. We went to Fall con,
it kicked major ass! and we were sing'n and dancin and groovin to the
music....yeah!  good times~ so. friday nite we played sardines and
12 people in this itty bitty closet. yeah, we basicly
suffocated...fuuun. the kids from arkansas. coolness. the last time
they got to see ppl from the distric was during LDC. hmmmmm, what
else? right now Steve Caldwell is speaking to us on being a UU and a
YA'er. were also having Claire sexton, Jennifer N-P and Casey
Jones. it never ceces to amaze me, you can know a person for years,
and yet, never really know them. amazing. were also having Amy
Leyenberger play the harp for our service. shes so good.</p>
