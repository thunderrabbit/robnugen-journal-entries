<p>Wow.</p>

<p>We were talking about the joke of Moses coming down with three
tablets, "My people, I have from God the 15.. er 10 Commandments"
cause one of the three tablets broke.</p>

<p>So I mentioned that Pope John Paul II recently added 4 thingies to
ponder in the rosary or something, and Sally goes, "Rick, what are
they?" and then joked that he's a bad catholic cause he didn't know.</p>

<p>Then he goes, my sister was amazed that I could quote a bible verse
recently, John 3:16.."</p>

<p>Thanks to Annabeth, and my willingness to do anything for a
hamburger at OB one day, I know that verse.</p>
