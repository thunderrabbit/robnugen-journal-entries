<p>I have just learned something about myself.</p>

<p>After I told Steve that I want to climb the ceiling support in the
sanctuary, and he said, "you probably shouldn't do that," I wondered
about why I want to do it.</p>

<p>If I did it, I would write my name on the top of the bar where it
couldn't possibly be seen from the ground until someone takes the
sanctuary apart or also climbs up there.</p>

<p>I would even be willing to do it and <em>not</em> write my name up
there.</p>

<p>So why do I want to do it?  Fame?  No.  Defying rules?  No.</p>

<p>I just want the experience.  I want to have the memory of having
climbed to the top of the church sanctuary.</p>

<p>It would be so easy to do.  I've verified that I could reach the
rail sufficiently well by standing on the back of the pew to get up
there.  But that's not enough.  It's not enough to know I could do
it.  I want the experience of having done that.</p>

<p>That's why I climbed through the tube over Southwest Freeway in
Houston.</p>

<p>That's why I climbed under the girders of the bridge in Fort
Worth.</p>

<p>That's why I climbed the tree to the toppest branches that were
only 4 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>That's why I would time the traffic light and skate like a rocket
down the hill and sail across Allen Parkway.</p>

<p>That's why Eric and I waded through waist deep floodwaters on Allen
Parkway.</p>

<p>That's why I'm going to Japan, and why I'm going to learn
Japanese.</p>

<p>To collect the experience.  To have a story (so yes, that's a bit
of fame)..  but I don't go blab to everyone the stuff I've done.  I
write it and remember it and share the story when appropriate.  I
often discourage people from doing the same thing.</p>

<p>So that's what I learned about myself.  I like having experiences.
Not just reading about them.  Experiencing them.</p>
