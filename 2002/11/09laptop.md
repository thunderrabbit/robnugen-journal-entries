<p>While walking past the window from the kitchen to the hallway, Jay,
a guy who worked in the kitchen all day was all, "I'll give you this
bag of grapes for your laptop," as he held out a rather large bag of
grapes.</p>

<p>"Okay!"  and I handed him my laptop and got a bag of grapes!</p>

<p>Walked around to the other door, munching grapes with glee and saw
Kate Robinson who was all, "where'd you get those grapes?"</p>

<p>"I traded my laptop for them!!"</p>

<p>.... blank look .... "That's not a good trade.  You should probably
trade back."</p>

<p>So I did, and that's how I traded a bunch of grapes to get my
laptop.</p>
