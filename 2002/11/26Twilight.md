<p class=date>6:12pm CST Tuesday 26 November 2002</p>

<p>It's quite dusky outside.  Looking at the map I see a rest area
just after um, Pecos, just just before Toyah or something.  I'm pretty
sure i can make it there; if not, there is one closer..  but I know
I'll make the one after Pecos.  I'll probably be quite awake and get
all the way to Balmoreah tonight, but it's possible they will be
closed for the evening when I get there.  In that case, there is
another rest area somewhat nearby.</p>

<p>I'm hoping I'll be able to just sleep without paying anything, and
then tomorrow get to explore around Balmoreah which Fred and I enjoyed
greatly back in 1984 or 83 or something when our parents took us cross
country to Grand Canyon and such.</p>

<p>Oh!!  That reminds me that i'll be close to Las Vegas, where I can
toss a single dollar into a slot machine and not be tempted to do
more, no matter what the outcome.</p>

<p>Back in the day, Fred and I got to play at the upper level of
Circus Circus in Las Vegas, which I mentioned to someone who responded
with "Circus Circus??  Awh that place is terrible...." or something.
We'll see.</p>
