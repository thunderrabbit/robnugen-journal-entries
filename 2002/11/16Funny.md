<p class=date>9:17am CST Saturday 16 November 2002</p>

<p>Before the leaders came in, about 10 of us hid in the bathroom and
came out one at a time.  They all laughed though, so the joke seemed a
bit lost to me.</p>

<p>Fred and I were the last out.  We doused our faces and hair in the
sink and said "no laugh" as we went out.  Our brotherly covenant for
the moment.</p>

<p class=date>10:41am</p>

<p>We need to break up into five groups and Annie was all, "let's go
around the circle and count to five," and I'm thinking of saying "one
two three four five!"  But I just laughed and said my appropriate
number (one).</p>

<p>Annie on the fact that we don't play Wink in this district: "I
can't <em>believe</em> you don't play that game in this
<em>district</em>!!!  I mean I hate it, but yeah."</p>

<p class=date>12:10pm</p>

<p>While in the sanctuary (my first time to really <em>be</em> in
there), I noticed that in the back of the room the ceiling support
comes temptingly close to the pews.  I might climb it later tonight.
We'll see.</p>
