<p class=date>3:42pm CST Saturday 2 November 2002</p>

<p>I just went to the corner store for some Dr Pepper and KitKat Bites
(to go with my two peanut butter sandwiches for protein).  On the way
back a cat said, "hey man, buy me a soda.." and I was all, "naw
man... you wanna drink?"  He did, "Aw yeah, I'm soo thirrsty!" and he
got the first chug on my liter DP.  I wondered if it burned his mouth
a lot to chug so much, especially when it's cold outside and the coke
is cold as well.</p>

<p>Got back to Wolf Shop and all the doors were closed and only my car
was in the parking lot.  "Awww man..." I went through different
scenarios in my head.. the only thing of value in the shop is my
<em>computer</em>, which of course in a mere $3000 worth of hardware,
plus the entries I've written but not yet put online... I pulled on
the door expecting it not to open, but it did.  Ahhh.</p>
