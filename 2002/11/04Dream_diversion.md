<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>'you create a diversion," I said to my friend.</p>

<p class=dream>We were in a mental hospital, so he starting spraying
shaving cream on the walls and theatening to kill someone.</p>

<p class=dream>I became him and sprayed shaving cream thickly at the
floors, with a spray can powerful enough to shoot like a waterhose
worth of foam at once.  I said threatening things like, "I'm going to
kill so and so" or something and people started fleeing or calling the
cops and security in the hospital.</p>

<p class=dream>I was simply trying to keep them from getting my
friend.</p>

<p class=dream>I went up the wide staircase and sprayed shaving cream
all over the hard tile surface, making them quite slick and dangerous.
So when I saw someone starting to chase me, I ran back and jumped down
all the stairs and carefully slid on the tile and slid along the
corner wall and around the corner and jumped down the next flight of
steps......</p>

<p class=dream>So then I was running and jumped down some more stairs
and out a door and since I knew I had to do this for real, I decided
that I needed a real way to escape, so instead of flying, I had
installed a trapeeze outside the door hanging off the overhang roof
thing and jumped out the door and with such force that when I grabbed the
trapeze, I just flew up it in a 270 degree arc and flopped onto a big
soft foam rubber cushion on the roof.  safe.</p>
