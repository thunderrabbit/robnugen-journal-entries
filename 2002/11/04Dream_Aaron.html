<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>At a rally at Aaron Ryan's house, like a farm and he
neeeded to cut down a large tree in his back yard and that fact had
been advertised on the rally flyer.  But when he cut it down, no one
was watching except me and it fell into a the neighbor's yard and
knocked down one of their trees.  Actually Aaron's tree was so
enormous that its branches basically dwarfed and bullied over the
neighbor's tree, and it fell on their roof and destroyed their garage
at first, and then smashed to bits their home.</p>

<p class=dream>They ran out of the house and we were all "oh shit" so
we ran over and I was thinking "ah they needed a new home anyway"
Their old house was unpainted now after years of wear and boards were
all falling apart and such.</p>
