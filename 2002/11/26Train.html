<p>Wow.  This was cool.  I saw a train crossing from left to right
under the freeway ahead of me.  Fine.</p>

<p>Then I saw the same train crossing from right to left under the
freeway ahead of me.  Wow.  Pretty cool.</p>

<p>But now our paths have gone asymptotic; I am "right beside" this
train (it's 100 yards to my left) as it's traveling fully sixty miles
per hour!!</p>

<p>For a freight train that seems quite amazing.  Plus it was going up
and down gentle slopes a bit ago.  So cool.  Of course the bullet
trains in Japan and Europe are faster, but it's built sleekly with
supa smoove tracks and such.  This is a freight train, all big and
boxy.  Amazing.</p>

<p>Synchronistically, just as I was passing the engines of the train,
the song "8 Mile" started, which features locomotive horn sound at the
beginning of the song.  Nice.</p>

<p>43 miles to Odessa.  327 miles traveled so far today.</p>

<p>Just stopped at a gas station to exchange liquids.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  I'm not sure where I am.  Hopefully as far as Midland or
even Odessa, but possibly only Big Spring.  349 miles traveled.</p>

<p>Midland.  Cool.</p>
