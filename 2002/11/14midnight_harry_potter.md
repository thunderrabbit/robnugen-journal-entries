<p>Jack woke me up at 10:20pm.</p>

<p>Earlier today Jack had asked if I can take him to <em>Harry Potter
and The Chamber of Secrets</em>, and I was all, "can I go with?" so
we're going to meet Josephine at the theater in a bit.  He purchased a
ticket for me online was I was sleepin'.</p>

<p class=date>3:20am CST Friday 15 November 2002</p>

<p>Just got home.  Pretty good movie.  There was one line that I
enjoyed, but seem to have forgotten.</p>

<p>Before the movie, we found Tara and found Josephine after a while.
Josephine saw the movie on the other screen they had set up.  Lots of
peeps wearing striped scarves and silly hats.  One cat even had his
face all marked up to be like a beard.</p>

<p>Before the movie, I snuck in to watch part of <em>8 Mile</em>.  Saw
the part where he goes to WJLB and the part that made Lilly scream and
bang on the windows.  Later I saw the first battle where he's called
The Beaver, and then where Rabbit starts his retort, "Ward, I think
you were a little hard on The Beaver..."</p>

<p>I came back into HP totally hyped.  Turns out I had time to watch
the next battle, but didn't.  Ah well.  I'll see it again.</p>
