<p>I slept from pleiades to orion, and now there is ice on Scott's
windshield.  I've got to pee and I'm choosing not to do so in this
parking area; I'm going to drive to Carlsbad (some miles) to find a 24
hour something hopefully.  And to warm up.</p>

<p>Oh, it wasn't ice; just fog on the inside.</p>

<p class=date>2:34am</p>

<p>Wandered aimlessly around a Super Wal-Mart, looking for that
perfect something to fix all my woes.  Found nothing, but saw some
cute Power Puff Girls blankets for only 15 dollars and watched the end
of <em>Ice Age</em> also available for 15 dollars.  Wandered out.</p>

<p>I'm stopped at a Rest Area (with no restrooms) / Weigh Station
(closed) to sleep some more.  Considered stopping by one of the motels
for shower/bed/electricity, but decided I'm not that desperate yet.</p>

<p>Why must i become desperate before I'll spend some $ to get nice
things?</p>

<p>Good night again.</p>

<p>Wow there is a flare burning on a short (30 foot) pole behind me.
How is it possible that I didn't notice that on my way into this
parking lot?</p>

<p>During the night I woke up once and the flare was off.  That's how.</p>
