<p>Rick told Erika to announce that the boy's bathroom needs to be
cleaned as part of her morning announcements.  So she did her
announcements and when she said "and the boy's bathroom needs to be
cleaned," Rick goes, "how do you know?"</p>

<p>And she was all, "um.." at first and then "hey!! you told me that!"</p>

<p>Hhahaahahahaha</p>
