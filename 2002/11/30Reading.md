<p>After lunch, after standing in Tadasana, experiencing the beauty
around me, I remembered I have my library of books to read.  I read
the remainder of _Mutant Message Down Under_ by Marlo Morgan.
Excellent mind broadening book reminding me that the universe is
infinte and can bring me anything I need at any time.  Reminds me to
append all my requests with "if it's in the highest good for all."</p>

<p>I sat meditatively for several minutes after reading, grokking the
fullness of the message.</p>

<p>Took me a while to get back into California speed demon driving
techniques.. then I just switched it on like a light.  zoom to Sally's
and Sock Monkey dialed with his tail again.  It was in the highest
good for all involved for me not to see Sally at that time, so I've
been visiting with Mike who works at Kinko's.  Cool cat.  Quite
friendly.  I wonder if he would enjoy working at Container Store.
hmmm.</p>

<p>I called Sally's cellie from Kinko's phone, told her where I was
and that my phone is dead.</p>
