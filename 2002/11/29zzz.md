<p class=date>2:45am PST Saturday 30 November 2002</p>

<p>Sock Monkey dialed first with his right paw.  No answer.  He flew
around like supermonkey while the phone rang.  Then he dialed with his
tail, just for variety.  No answer.  (No variety.)</p>

<p>So Socks, Scott and I are going to go sleep down at that winding
road by the bay.  I'm thankful to have found it.</p>

<p class=date>2:58am</p>

<p>Okay.  Status: 1917 miles traveled so far.  I've been awake since
5:05am MST, so that's basically 23 hours.  In that time Scott and I
have driven (1917 - 1137 = ) 780 miles.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>Oh wait.  California, this is your big chance to really sell me on
living here by keeping me warm tonight.</p>
