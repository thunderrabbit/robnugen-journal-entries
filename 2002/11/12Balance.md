<p>From Meg's livejournal:</p>

<pre>
when i eat, the tastes have to be balanced
im eating pie, i need a pickle
im eating a pickle, i need ice cream
im eating cereal, i need a pickle
eating a muffin, i need peanutbutter
or some kind of drink that balances the sweet to salty ratio
that kind of thing.

im eating the raisins
the peanuts are there to supervise the sweet content of the raisins
better not go over board
so i eat a peanut
then a raisin
peanut
raisin
sometimes both at once
Balance. 
</pre>

<p>My favorite part is that within all this text, only the final word
is capitalized.</p>
