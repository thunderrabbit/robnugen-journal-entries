<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Driving Karaoke, Janette, and Jack really fast down
some clay hills streets of Dallas, except we were riding on a dolly.
Very fun wizzing around on that.</p>

<p class=dream>We headed quickly down a hill on which we had to turn
at the bottom, but they got off before we got to the bottom. I was a
bit offended that they wouldn't trust that I could stop the dolly
smoothly in time.  I did, but it was no problem to go back and get
them, knowing that I at least, had successfully navigated that hill at
high speed.</p>
