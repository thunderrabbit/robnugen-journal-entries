<p class=date>2:28pm MST Thursday 28 November 2002</p>

<p>Just visited with Jackie, one of the Cave Restoration Foundation
volunteers that was cleaning Longfellows Bathtub (I had the name wrong
before).  She has been doing this type of work for four years now.
Used to live up in Alaska working in the fishing industry (tells me
not to have raw sea bass because it often has parasites) on a fish
ferry that carries fish from the fishing boats back to shore so those
cats don't have to stop fishing.  Her boat would also deliver mail to
them and such.</p>

<p>She inquired a bit about my adventure, so I gave her an adventure
card; my first to give out on this western state tour.</p>

<p>She had to split to connect with her fellow cave cleaners at 2:30.</p>
