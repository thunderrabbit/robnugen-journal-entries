<p class=date>7:04pm CST Tuesday 26 November 2002</p>

<p>I'm at another rest area - the one before Pecos.  Just chillin' for
a second and stretch before the next one which is 119 miles away.
That's the one I have my sights on tonight, but that seems a bit far
for me.  Maybe.</p>

<p>Oh wait.  no.  The one I have eyes on is a picnic area with no
facilities.  I can use a Toyah restroom when I wake up.  I've only got
like 50 miles to go before sleepin' a bit.</p>
