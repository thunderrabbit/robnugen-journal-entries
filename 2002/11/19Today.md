<p>I got to ride the truss down and back up today!  That was certainly
a highlight of my work day.  I climbed the steps to get to the
catwalks and where the trusses are flying (by fly they mean hang) to
set the limit on the curtains (keep them from being closed too far)
and to adjust some of their heights.</p>

<p>Chris (my new hero) slid down the chain when the truss was lowered
(I could have done that but didn't get the chance since I rode down
with the truss).  That was cool enough, but even better is that he
<em>climbed</em> the chain back up to the top!  That's like 40 feet,
and the chain is no velvet rope to hang from.  I'm impressed.</p>

<p>And for some reason he thinks he's scrawny.</p>
