<p>In my room, there used to be boxes in the unused bathtub and no
window treatment in the bathroom.  The toilet and sink did work,
though; that was enough for me.</p>

<p>But now I find that the bathtub has been cleared out, a thoughtful
curtain put up, and even flowers in a small vase on the sink.
Beautiful.  I'm really thankful to live here.</p>
