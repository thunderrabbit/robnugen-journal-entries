<p>Josephine is so funny!!</p>

<p>I was all, "is it your night to do the dishes?" and she mocked me
with a little "me me mme mee me me me meemee?"  and I go, "cause I was
thinking about helping you with them."</p>

<p>"Me me me meme meme meme me me me, what?"</p>

<p>She's secretly (actually it's no secret) just trying to do anything
besides her homework.</p>
