<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I'm tired.  On break now at work.  It's not like I've done that
much, but maybe I have.  Today began with loading some stuff into
Johnny's truck and then cutting the 105 foot length of the skrim.  In
this case the tolerance was 2 mm, lots easier then 1 mm last night.  I
think I got the cut perect all the way down the length.  Took a bit
over an hour.</p>

<p>Cut some wood and then ripped a 1/4 inch plywood sheet into 2 3/4
inches strips.  Then cut all those mugs down to 7 inches.  Then sanded
smooth one side of each piece.  I found a pretty speedy method of
sanding.  It seems faster than the way I've seen other people sand
them.  I think the end result is just as good.</p>

<p>Been helping Charles glue fabric to large wooden frames 20 x 4 feet
or so.  Like big canvases for painting.  <em>Exactly</em> like big
canvases for painting.</p>

<p>During lunch I went home and saw Jack, but Josephine and the
kittens didn't show up for lunch.  Jack and I both thought today is
their lunch at home day.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is my not at work day; I'm going to San Antonio for CYA
meeting as part of youth advisor training.</p>
