<p class=date>1:29pm CST Wednesday 13 November 2002</p>

<p>At work today I have cleaned out a couple cubic feet of sawdust
from behind a saw, and moved some big display things to the dumpster.
And re-archived some big backdrops and some old drawings.</p>

<p>Relatively fun way to make some $$</p>

<p class=date>8:02pm</p>

<p>I'm back at work, waiting outside because it's locked up.  Near the
end of the normal work day, Diane said that Johnny asked if I can help
lay some skrim.  Ann just drove up.</p>

<p class=date>10:36pm</p>

<p>Done now.  We layed out a huge scrim (interesting that I spelled it
differently this time) about 30 by 104 feet.  I just spent the last 40
minutes meticulously cutting the 30 foot height exactly (*) along the
weave.</p>

<p>(*) maybe not perfect, but I'd bet it's within 3 threads of where I
started.</p>

<p>Going home now.</p>

<p class=date>11:16pm</p>

<p>Oh my gosh; I forgot an interesting part of work tonight.  Soon
after Ann and I got inside, we heard gunshots outside.  Apparently,
this is a common occurence as the warehouse is on the edge of a
thug/drug ville of Dallas.</p>

<p>We called the cops and they came over and it turns out the liquor
store had been robbed around the same time we heard the gunshots.</p>

<p>Very exciting.</p>
