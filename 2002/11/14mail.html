<p>My next task with the comments is sending the comments to myself
via email so I won't have to telnet (actually ssh) to my site to see
them.</p>

<p>I look on google and find references to Net::SMTP and uses
SendMail, but neither of these are installed on my site's server.  I
don't imagine I can install "local" versions without root access, or a
lot more unix info in my brain.</p>

<p>I wonder if I can just append the files to my mail file.  That
would be pretty rad.</p>

<p>I'm pretty tired and am going to nap for a while.</p>
