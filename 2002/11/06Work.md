<p class=date>5:37pm CST Wednesday 6 November 2002</p>

<p>Just getting off work at Prestonwood.  I actually drove, so I'm
about to drive back, but I don't seem to have the same (any)
passengers.</p>

<p>But, the reason I'm writing is that as we were signing out, this
cat named Pat was all, "who's Bob Nugen?" all loud and shit.  I raised
my hand and he goes, "if you ever write that kind of shit on the
timesheet again you'll never work in this state again."</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I guess I shouldn't write "Pat is a big fucking moron" on the
timesheet.</p>

<p>Of course, I <em>didn't</em> write that on the timesheet.</p>

<p>I had clocked out and back in for lunch at 12:45 and back at 2:30.</p>

<p>"You don't gotta write the damn minutes and seconds on this; just
write the nearest hour."</p>

<p>"I like to be precise."  What I might have said was, "I wanted to
be honest that I took longer than 1 hour for lunch," but I didn't.</p>

<p>Now I'm wondering why oh why would he complain?  Hard to add up
times to the nearest 45 minute mark?  Man, fuck him.</p>

<p>Wow.  Getting home from work took 1.5 hours cause traffic was so
stinky.</p>
