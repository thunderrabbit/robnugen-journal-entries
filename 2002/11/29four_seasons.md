<p>Holy shit I can't believe how late it is.</p>

<p>One may decide eventually that one writes too much in one's journal.</p>

<p>I left Sally's place despite concerns that I would have less of a
chance of getting a parking space; I figure as it got later on a
Friday night, more people would be coming home.</p>

<p>After turning the wrong direction and winding along a one way
narrow road around this bay, I spent several minutes lost lost lost in
lots of empty lots, looking for a lost Kinko's cause I wanted to get
internet access, but mostly because I had to poop.</p>

<p>No Kinko's in sight; nothing good at all.  Drove back to where I
saw gas stations, but they were closed (as far as their insides were
concerned).  So...  What to do, oh what to do, I gots to pooh..  </p>

<p>The Four Seasons.</p>

<p>It took a while for me to find its lighted tree lined entrance, but
once I did, I was greeted by a valet, "Good morning, sir.  Will you be
checking in with us now?"</p>

<p>"Um, actually no.  I just need to use the restroom."</p>

<p>"Not a problem.."  he gave me directions to the restroom once I got
inside.</p>

<p>Let me tell you, after being so desperate for an hour, finding the
marble floored, cloth hand towels, enormous mirrors, actual working
hot and cold water.. wow.  What a great relief.</p>

<p>I'm back at Sally's parking lot.  Good luck, me.</p>
