<p>D'oh!</p>

<p>I just realized that Janette asked me to deposit her check for
her.  I forgot.  I doubt the banks are still open.</p>

<p>I just woke up from sleeping on a set of chairs near the band.
What was their name?  Something like Jimmy James and the New Turk
Band.</p>

<p>So sad that Edward and Casey are <em>bored</em>.  Bored!  How can
they be bored when there are so many people to talk to and so much
space to sit thoughtfully or meditatively, and so much paper on which
they may draw or write.</p>

<p>An infinite number of games and activities await, and they feel
bored.</p>
