<p>Wow that was fun.  Scottie's check engine light just came on out in
the middle of the dark highway 17 south.  I was smart enough to put a
quart of oil in my front floorboard instead of in my trunk where I'd
have to take off my bike and bike rack to get to it, so I am thankful
for that.  I don't have a flashlight to see what I'm doing so I tried
using Scott's headlights and reflect them to inside the engine, but
that didn't really work. so I used my computer screen to light the
engine.  Oil is low.  More oil in and now we are off to Marfa
hopefully with no problems.  Except that I spilled some oil on the
valve cover and on the bumper.</p>

<p>494.1 miles traveled.</p>

<p>546.6 miles traveled.  I'm in Marfa.  I can see why Jack hates this
town.  Not even the gas stations are open 24 hours.  I'm parked behind
Thunderbird Restaurant to sleep.</p>

<p>On the way here, I went through Fort Davis (city, not the fort) and
a fox(?) ran across the road close in front of me.  And then a black
cat did as well.  I could only see that cat's eyes.</p>
