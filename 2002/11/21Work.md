<p class=date>6:01pm CST Thursday 21 November 2002</p>

<p>Today at Prestonwood, I was mostly up in the catwalks, crawling
around tying ropes and tightening other ropes, rearranging large
sections of fabric, and generally having a good time.</p>

<p>Funny thing is that I went home with the elevator key.  I wonder if
I could make a copy of it very easily.</p>

<p>We had to leave Prestonwood around 1:30 cause there was a funeral
scheduled for 3pm.</p>

<p>At Wolf Shop, I mostly helped Justin glue spangles onto big sheets
of fabric.</p>

<p>I also got to help Oksana, the cute Russian girl.  She asked if I
would help her with something and I thought <em>how do you say</em>
"I'll do anything for you" <em>in Russian?</em></p>

<p>I'm so silly.</p>
