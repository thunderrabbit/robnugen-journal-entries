<p>I've spent a bit of time working on code that will allow comments
on my entries.  Eventually, I'd like to create a system that will
allow people to view comments, and for people to be able to log in to
my site so they won't have to enter their name each time they
comment.  For now, clicking on the linked period below an entry will
display a page of the entry that would be commented on.</p>
