<p class=date>12:27pm CST Saturday 23 November 2002</p>

<p>Now I've gotten my finances up to date.  Have paid off the balance
on fixing Scott just before I left for SWUUSI way back in July.  Have
paid my credit card off (mostly gas purchases, but also for my website
hosting for the next 13 months) and all is lovely.</p>

<p>Going to put new spark plugs on Scott now.</p>

<p>I got these new crazy spark plugs with <a href="https://www.boschautoparts.com/en/auto/spark-plugs/platinum-4-spark-plugs"> four (4) electrode
things to spark.</a>  Wow.</p>
