<p>I doubt it will be easily visible, but I just took a picture of
McDonald Observatory as i just crested a hill to discover it on a
small mountain.  586.3 miles traveled so far.</p>

<p class=date>12:14pm</p>

<p>I've now purchased a postcard for my dad at the visitors center.
I'm going to walk 1 mile horizontally and 500 feet vertically to the
big open to public telescope.  Most people drive, but the girl at the
gift shop said I can walk it "if you want to..."</p>

<p>"I'll see how I feel when I get outside and see it."</p>

<p>I see it, and I feel fine.</p>

<p class=date>1:04pm</p>

<p>I drove.  I encountered a fence with equipment behind it and chose
not to walk through that area.</p>

<p>Drove up to the observatory and enjoyed seeing ice affixed to and
dripping from trees.  Climbed the steps to see the telescope and it
was as big and boring as I guessed it would be.  But I did learn a few
things like when the first space shuttle launched (April 1981) and
that this observatory did the first laser lunar-distance measurements
back in the day, and that the pleiades are 410 light years distant.</p>

<p>Oh, and that they have nightly star parties at the 107 inch
telescope after dark throughout the year.</p>

<p>Going now to Balmorhea.</p>

<p>Heehee; as the wind blew through the frozen leaves, a virtual
snowstorm spattered onto the parking lot.  I stood in it for a while.
Fun!</p>
