<p>While Steve and Melanie each had a bit of wine while discussing the
process that we experienced, I took a wonderful nap using Lisa's hip
as a pillow.</p>

<p>On the way home, Steve told us passionately about how Hillary and
Bethany transitioned to homeschooling.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>He's playing the guitar now as I synchronize my email and
journals.</p>

<p>Goodnight soon.</p>
