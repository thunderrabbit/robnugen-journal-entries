<p class=date>6:10am MST Thursday 28 November 2002</p>

<p>Heehee.  MST = Mountain Standard Time.  I'm on Mountain Time!</p>

<p>I'm waking up to a thin band of red/orange/yellow on the horizon
which deepens to dark blue behind me.</p>

<p>I'll be first in line at Carlsbad Caverns.  I hope that doesn't
mean I'll be waiting forever...</p>

<p class=date>6:41am</p>

<p>Oops.  I looked at my phone which is still on CST, so I have an
hour plus ten minutes to wait.  I think I'll ride my bike around.</p>

<p class=date>7:37am</p>

<p>Wow.  Fun ride.  Downdowndowndowndowndown down down down down the
hill for about 12 minutes.  Had on my thermal shirt, T-shirt (U2
concert), hoodie, helmet, jeans, socks, shoes, heavy leather gloves.
Was still a bit cold with the sun just barely peaking over the hill at
various points.</p>

<p>Then back up.</p>

<p>Up.</p>

<p>up</p>

<p>up.</p>

<p>up.</p>

<p>Up</p>

<p>up</p>

<p>For about 24 minutes, including a couple stops for very short
rests.  Tight tight tight quads once I reached the top.  Oh, and there
is a downward slope at the top of the hill so I was able to reach top
speed again going back up the mount to the visitors center.  Nice.</p>

<p>Now I'm hoping to be able to do a strenuous caving tour that
requires crawling.  I'll find out when the open in 18 minutes.</p>

<p class=date>12:13pm</p>

<p>Done with Carlsbad exploration.  I'll write in a moment.  Kinda
headachey now.  I'm going inside with computer to see if I can use an
electrical outlet to recharge my battery.</p>
