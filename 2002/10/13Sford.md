<p>So I'm in Chicago at M's house.  sford is house sitting for her.</p>

<p>He took me to get deep dish four cheese pizza with mushrooms,
onions, broccoli, pineapple.  We talked about everything from
computers to astronomy to brains to life to society to go to remote
viewing to everything.  Awesome.</p>

<p>I'm pretty much too tired to give specifics, but I'm thankful for
the experience.</p>
