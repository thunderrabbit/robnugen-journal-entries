<p>Recently Maraiah (who I've 'known' from college for 11 years) sent
me a reverse survey, where we tell what we know about the other
person.  I don't know a lot about her really, but I wrote what I
could, plus added funny stuff to fill in the blanks.</p>

<p>She filled out the same survey for me, and it was quite flattering.
There's part of me that wants to maybe hook up with her now, but I
intentionally included in my reply to her reply that I'm in love with
Sally in Cali to lower the chance of Maraiah being interested in
me.</p>

<p>I should go back to bed.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>
