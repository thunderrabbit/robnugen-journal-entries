<p class=date>3:10pm EDT Monday 14 October 2002</p>

<p>After some brainstorming with Steve, I'm sketching out some ideas
for Kim's website, so I can finish my web-design-debt to him and quit
worrying about it longer.</p>

<p>Thing is, I've got in my head a grand idea of making it really
really really awesomely easy for him to update, and I just don't know
if I'm smart enough to make it all happen.</p>

<p>Of course I am, but dammmm; this is a good challenge.</p>

<p class=date>5:21pm</p>

<p>no, this is a sucky challenge.</p>

<p>I emailed Kim to see if I could get him to call me here and go over
specifications with me.  My I-group will be meeting in about 1 hour,
oh wait they are meeting right now since my computer is still on EDT.
Lemme fix that.</p>

<p class=date>4:27pm</p>

<p>Oh.  I'm silly.  It's an hour earlier now, not later.</p>
