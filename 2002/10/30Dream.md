<p class=dream>Working in a supermarket restocking magazines kinda and
also folding a wire to  measure something and talking about languages
and deciding to learn Iranian because they say toilet for toilet and
if any language is based on that, then I dcan learn it.</p>

<p class=dream>I wasn't clear on whether I was restocking books or
magazines or building shelves forthem or coosing good books to read;
they had some by ray Bradbury and Bill Clinton and some magazines like
Vogue and Cosmopolitan and Redbook and stuff.</p>
