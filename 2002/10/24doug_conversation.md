<p class=date>10:34am CDT Thursday 24 October 2002</p>

<p>I have just called Doug and scheduled a talk with him at 1:pm
ish.</p>

<p>yammering about japan</p>

there are adults in the district who think it's time for you to move on.

"yeah well fuck them" I'm thinking.

Gail didn't know about dedication to me so maybe it's not a done deal

he's repeating a story about about japan that he already told me.

re directors at plano

liability issues for someone not involved as a regular advisor

so the fact that I've been an advisor for 6 years means nothing?

they think I am getting my socialization from YRUU.

I told him about my men's group

Because I'm single and 32 and playing with the youth

If you were someone in my congregation, I would tell you to move on.
and I know that's hard to hear.

The potenetial liability issue if someone says something.

I would urge you to think carefully about it. 

I can understand that you're angry; I would be pissed.

<p>I explained my quandry; I can either not go to the rally and lie to
my youth about why.  They know my schedule and my priorities.  They
know I wouldn't let anything get in the way.  Except maybe my own
death.  If anyone else dies, fuck them, they'll still be dead after
the rally.</p>

<p>I pointed out that none of the reasons he told me not to go include
that it would be better for the youth if I don't go.  None.  All of
them were based on my safety and covering my ass.</p>

<p>He appreciated that I listened to him and appear to be taking his
advice into consideration.  He also suggested that I talk to other
adults to get input from them.</p>
