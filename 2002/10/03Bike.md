<p>Rode my bike slowly around the neighborhood which is basically
meshed with a golf course that seems well manicured and well used.</p>

<p>Got to the front of the subdivision where the roadway goes under a
railroad tressel which goes over a river at the same point.  I took
the railroad tracks about 2.5 or 3 miles, assuming the posts numbered
"7" "8" and "9" were each a mile apart. </p>

<p>I wondered how far I could take them.  Which way am I going?  Where
would I end up?  If only I had a support system of, say, maps donated
by MapQuest, internet access donated by Kinko's, or maybe by some
company that provides internet access via satellite, a digital video
camera donated by someone, a GPS compass donated by someone...  I
think that would make a pretty marketable trek.  Oh, and food donated
by Ben & Jerry's.  Oh and maybe some food besides ice cream.</p>

<p>I mean, shit, I could put a camera on my helmet, one watching what
I'm watching and one watching my face as I ride.  I wonder if that
kind of bandwidth is available via satellite except for the
government.  Oh and one camera pointed behind me so no one could sneak
up on me since lots of peeps could know exactly where I was
located.</p>
