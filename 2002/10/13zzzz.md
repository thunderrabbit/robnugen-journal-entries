<p>I want to eat.  But actually I just feel sad and want to eat to
block that emotion.  I'm sad about not going to San Antonio Rally.
I'm going to miss you guys like crazy.</p>

<p>I'm sad that I can't tell you why I can't go.  I fucked up and
pissed some people off and now I'm not going.  I've been asked to also
not attend Houston Rally.  I really really really want to go to
Houston.  That's effectively my last rally ever.</p>

<p>I love you guys so much.  You're so smart and capable and
beautiful.  So funny and daring and awesome.  Thank you for the
opportunity to help you grow.</p>
