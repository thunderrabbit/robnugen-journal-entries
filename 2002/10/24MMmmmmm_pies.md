<p>Janette and I made pies last night.  She did most everything, but I
sure did a good job pouring sugar into the bowl as the egg whites were
being whipped.  (M & M, what is the difference between whipping eggs
and beating eggs?)  Oh, and I monitored the heavy cream to make sure
it didn't turn into butter.  Such a challenge it was for me to stop
the thing; she said soon it would have turned into butter just like
<em>that</em> with a snap of her fingers.  Wow.</p>

<p>"Add a little salt and it would taste just like butter," she
added.</p>

<p>"Really?  Butter would taste like.... <em>butter</em>??"</p>

<p>Oh, I also got to mix peanutbutter and powdered sugar for the
peanutbutter pie.  I have a very sweet tasting t-shirt on now.</p>

<p>We made banana cream pie and peanutbutter pie.</p>

<p>Oh, and I got to put the merange on the pb pie.  I'm an expert
meragner I'm sure, especially since I think I'm spelling that
incorrectly.  Merangue?  Wow. I can't even find it on <a

<p>Anyway, yummy pies.</p>
