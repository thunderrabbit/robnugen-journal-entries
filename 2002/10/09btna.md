<p>Oh this was funny:  Phone rang, Abbey got it.  It was for Betina,
one of her housemates.  Last night when I originally thought her name
was Petina, I was corrected and Abbey said they sometimes abbreviate
it at B'tina, or maybe even Btna.  I said, "booty, tits and ass?" and
Betina was all, "why do you have to emphasize the booty so much?"  And
Abbey came up with Boots Tits And Ass, with jokes around knocking
boots.</p>

<p>So anyway there was a call for Betina, and while Sarah was looking
for her, Abbey said "boots tits and ass" and the caller almost
certainly could have heard, but hopefully didn't know Abbey was
talking about Betina, cause the caller was Betina's dad.</p>

<p>We laughed a lot when Abbey hung up.</p>
