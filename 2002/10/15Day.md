<p class=date>9:04am CDT Tuesday 15 October 2002</p>

<p>Today I'm still in Chicago, still at M's house, hosted by Steve.  I
stayed another night because he was so helpful with my perl problem.
I'm quite thankful for that.</p>

<p>I need to leave by 1pm to be gone before it gets all crazy here
with M and her three kids coming home.  (They know I'm here, but Steve
asked that I geo before they arrive.</p>
