<p class=dream>Talking with the two members of NWA in my room.  They
were black in my dream with white skin.  I listened to their music and
it was really funny and creative and good.  I told them in honesty
that I now wish I had gotten into them a long time ago so I could have
grown up listening to their shit.</p>

<p class=dream>"But instead, I know all the songs by DJ Jazzy Jeff and
Fresh Prince, plus um, Beastie Boys, and a lot by Sir Mix-A-Lot...  Oh
and Eminem nowadays," which reminded me that I can <em>start</em>
listening to them (NWA) now.</p>

<p class=dream>They nodded understandingly and thoughtfully.  Ah, the
plight of a single lost listener.</p>
