<p class=date>4:34pm EDT Monday 7 October 2002</p>

<p>Walked about 2 miles each way on the railroad tracks with
Elizabeth, discussing love/hate vs indifference, childhood scar
stories (she fell out of barn, I busted my head on skates), nature of
god and life on earth and karma and such.  Excellently worth the time
after 12:00 noon that I hoped to leave.  "More like noon than 5pm, but
the only thing that would keep me here is a long walk with anyone who
wants to go."  Woke up Elizabeth and we went.  She's awesomely
fun.</p>

<p>Walked with Cordie and Sarah to the pond where Sarah fished with a
bit of a lure stuck on a stick.  Didn't catch anything.</p>

<p>Hugs from peeps except Elizabeth when I left.  Barbie would not
watch me leave.  I heard Sarah crying in the background as I was
driving off and Elizabeth was all, "wait wait wait wait!  You have a
sock monkey!  I just bought materials to make a sock monkey."</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>Thank you, West Virginia family.  I look forward to seeing you
again, but I don't know when that will be.</p>
