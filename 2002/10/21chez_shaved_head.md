<p>Chez shaved her head!!!</p>

<p>It looks so awesome!</p>

<p>During the day she got it cut, didn't like it, got it cut again,
and that's when her mom saw it (and liked it fine), but Chez didn't
like it, so she got it shaved.  Her dad saw it and was all, "will it
grow back??"</p>

<p>Her mom hasn't seen it yet, but Chez told her she shaved it and her
mom doesn't believe her.</p>

<p>Chez joked that her dad will be all, "Oh my god did you see Chez'
hair?" and mom will be all, "yeah, I know," like it's no big deal.</p>

<p>Funny.</p>

<p>Janette and I just got chinese food and three (3) movies
<em>invasion of the body snatchers</em>, <em>the hunger</em>, and
<em>art of war</em>.  They are due back in two days.</p>
