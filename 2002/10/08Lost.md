<p>D'oh!  (times three)</p>

<p>My computer lost its battery so the clock got reset.  Lemme fix
that..</p>

<p class=date>8:51am EDT Tuesday 8 October 2002</p>

<p>Okay, that's better.  (ironically emacs lost its mind when I reset
the time and it crashed)</p>

<p>I've left my sweat pants and hoodie in West Virginia.  And I'm
beginning to notice some cold weather around me.  I can replace them
relatively easily (but that was a really nice hoodie; I will ask them
to send it to me); I'll visit a thrift store today and see what I can
find.</p>

<p>But as I was preparing for my day, I find that my clear plastic
folder thing of my current notes/letters/things to do is missing!
D'oh!  I guess I left it in West Virginia as well.  I'll call them and
see if they can find it.</p>
