<p>Josephine, Tara, Logan just came home for their non-third-period
class.  Joey was all, "my mom made BREAD????"</p>

<p>me: "yeah, we taught her how."</p>

<p>"Yeah right."</p>

<p>As she was cutting it, I was all, "haha we got it while it was warm."</p>

<p>She spent a moment thinking of a snappy comeback, then looks at me
with shrewd eyes, "... I can toast it."</p>

<p>That was funny enough.</p>

<p>But then she burnt the toast a bit... hahaha</p>

<p>They are so much fun!</p>
