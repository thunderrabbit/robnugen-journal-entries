<p>Okay.  So now I'm going to crack out these maps again and see what
I can figure out.</p>

<p class=date>1:36am</p>

<p>Okay, here are my estimated mileages between cities I plan to visit:</p>

<p>Barboursville, WV -&gt; Columbus, OH: 132 miles
<br>Columbus, OH  -&gt; Oberlin, OH: 130 miles
<br>Oberlin, OH -&gt; Kalamazoo, MI: 290 miles
<br>Kalamazoo, MI -&gt; Chicago, IL: 156 miles
<br>Chicago, IL -&gt; Bloomington, IL: 137 miles
<br>Bloomington, IL -&gt; Columbia, MO: 250 miles
<br>Columbia, MO  -&gt; Springfield, MO: 160 miles
<br>Springfield, MO -&gt; Tulsa, OK: 189 miles
<br>Tulsa, OK -&gt; OKC, OK: 3 hours
<br>OKC, OK -&gt; Dallas, TX: 3 hours
<br>Dallas, TX -&gt; San Antonio, TX: 4 hours</p>

<p>I wonder if I'll be able to squeeze in a day to visit Cedar
Point...</p>

<p>Okay, I have confirmed that my estimates were pretty close to what
<a href="http://www.mapquest.com">Mapquest</a> suggests (I'm really
impressed with all that mapquest offers free of charge, and how
intuitive their interface is), and I've emailed my peeps in various
cities I plan to visit.  Going to go walk on the nearby mountain to
see what I can see.</p>

<p>An hour ago I was feeling sorta trapped here, needing to get moving
on my adventure.  Now I'm more relaxed that I have a plan.</p>
