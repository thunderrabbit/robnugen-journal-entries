<p>I'm getting tired of my adventure I think.  Maybe I'm just flat
tired physically (after staying up late watching movies, and up early
for church) and mentally (for working on Kim's website and reading
livejournal and news.google.com)</p>

<p>But what I'm noticing is that I'm less and less planning ahead my
adventure.  I gave Amelia only 1 day's notice, and I emailed Calder
<em>today</em> to see if I can say HI to her tonight.  I don't know
where/if I'll stay in Tulsa overnight tonight.  blah.</p>

<p>I don't remember their phone number or Bhyllx's email address or
nothin' to give them *any* advanced warning.  Poop poop poop.</p>
