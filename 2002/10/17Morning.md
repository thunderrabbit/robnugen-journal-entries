<p class=date>9:19am CDT Thursday 17 October 2002</p>

<p>Wow.  That's a lot more dream typing than I usually do.</p>

<p>Getting up now.  I'm leaving today, but I might do laundry first.
I will if I have more than 1 outfit dirty.</p>

<p class=date>10:41am</p>

<p>M&M Mom fed me breakfast after I showered and discovered the only
dirty laundry I had was that which I was wearing.  I haven't done
laundry since Kalamazooooo.... (13 oct)</p>

<p>I'm at Kinko's now, going to work on Kim's website a bit before I
roll out through St Louis (to see the arch, plus it's on the way) and
then to Columbia, Missouri, where I lived from 1 year old to 8 years
old.  (Back in my foolish youth when I counted years instead of
days)</p>

<p class=date>12:19pm</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to roll out of here, after I get a snack of some
sort hopefully at a grocery store if I can find one.</p>

<p>I've gotten good stuff done on Kim's site.  Now my code will create
files, modify existing files, sort the files, hide files, restore
files.  And it almost certainly will work for multiple sets of files.
Now I just need to write the viewer for the users.</p>

<p>For some reason, I cannot get email to go out to addresses other
than my own.  Weird.</p>
