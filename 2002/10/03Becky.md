<p>Wow!</p>

<p>Becky has just given me the greatest approval/blessing of my
grander adventure, saying that it's the greatest thing that anyone in
our family has ever done.</p>

<p>I don't know about all <em>that</em>, but I certainly appreciate
the thought.</p>

<p class=date>9:04am</p>

<p>Becky believes that once Fred is done with his education, he wants
to make a lot of money.  I disagree, but I'm writing it down for the
record..</p>

<p class=date>9:58am</p>

<p>Becky and I have just been engaged in conversation about God and
reality and life and death and consequences.  Good stuff.</p>

<p class=date>11:35am</p>

<p>Checked my email; didn't read livejournal.  I would like to plan
the rest of my trip, but the internet connection here seems pretty
slow to do it via mapquest.  I don't know of any atlases (atlii?) here
to let me look up distances between cities.  And no, I don't have any
maps.  Hmm. I wonder if there is a AAA office nearby-ish...  They will
give me free maps.</p>

<p>Becky called Barbie to see how to get to AAA, but Barbie said it's
difficult and we'll get lost, so we're going to wait for Shane to get
home and he'll take me.  So now I'm going to go ride my bike around.</p>
