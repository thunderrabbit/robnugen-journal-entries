<p>I'm so thrilled to discover soy milk in my magic box!!  I drank one
last night on my way from Oberlin to Kalamazoo, and this morning Joana
offered me some cereal.. except she had no milk.  "I've got some soy
milk in the car!"  Wow how totally perfect is that??  Thanks to
Janette for such a wonderful magic box.</p>


They had a couple of dirty dishes in the sink, so I washed those in an attempt to earn my keep.  I still don't really know what else I can do quite yet.

Joana arrived home from class about 20 minutes ago, and seemed poised on the couch adjacent to the futon where I slept.  I was  all, "what would you do if I weren't here?"

"Sleep."

"Excellent.  Go to it."

<p>So she is sleeping now while I took a shower and am now
internetified.</p>
