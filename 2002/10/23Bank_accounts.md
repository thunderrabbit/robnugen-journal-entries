<p>Yesterday Sean was talking with his mom, having some money issues,
as many college students do.</p>

<p>She was all, "don't worry Sean, tomorrow you'll have lots of
money," cause she was going to send him about a hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Instead, she accidentally deposited her check ($800) into his
account ($100).  So she burst in the door like "can I use the
computer?" and verified what she had done.  "D'oh!!"</p>

<p>Hahahahhaah!!!</p>

<p>Sean's going to be all <em><b><font size='+2' color=magenta>"THANKS,
MOM!!!!!"</font></b></em></p>

<p>Okay, now she has transferred the money to her account.</p>

<p><em><b><font size='+2' color=magenta>"NEVERMIND!"</font></b></em></p>

<p>Funny funny.</p>
