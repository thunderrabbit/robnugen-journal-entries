<p>Went to Madeleine's work, which is in a Presbyterian church near
OSU (I think).  She has basically created her job(s) in the world,
training public school bus drivers who have to drive long (150 miles
each way) routes on a daily (or more) basis, working toward prison
reform, training people in something else, and other stuff and lots of
peace activism.</p>

<p>Basically I checked email while she went to lunch, then she gave me
a tour of her work and the church.  It's big, old and nice.</p>
