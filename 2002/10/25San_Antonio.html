<p>I feel really really really really sad about not being able to go
to San Antonio.  I cried with Janette hearing my sadness.  My greatest
fear, I told her, is that youth will be all, "where's Rob? where's
Rob? where's Rob?" and that they will somehow think that maybe I don't
love them quite enough to overcome all obstacles to attend the rallies
I said I would attend.</p>

<p>Know that I love you all more than most other things in the world.
It has taken a pretty big wacked out situation to keep me away, and I
trust that it is all ultimate, for the best for you, my beloved
youth.</p>

<p>Bill called my cellie while they were on the way to the rally.
Whole posse of youth, whose names I dare not mention since I'll miss
some.  But like 10 names from Tulsa I think.  So awesome.  I'm really
thankful for them thinking of me.</p>

<p>I love you all.</p>
