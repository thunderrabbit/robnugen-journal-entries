<p class=date>1:25am EDT Monday 7 October 2002</p>

<p>Watched a few minutes of Space Ghost on Adult Swim on Cartoon
Network since Edward Lerner seems pretty entertained by it.  I wanted
to check out what I was missing.  I can see where he would think it's
funny.  There was one good line on there, but I forgot it.</p>

<p>Barbie's going to wake me up in the morning and we may go for a
walk, or more specifically Barbie may join Elizabeth and I for a walk,
although I'd like to be sure that I get my car to Jiffy Lube to get
the oil changed and do a transmission fluid exchange before I begin
the next part of my adventure.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
