<p>Just had a great conversation with my uncle Rick, who unfortunately
I will not be able to see this time since I didn't really plan ahead
as I left Memphis and I've ended up waiting here because I thought
Rachel and Hamidah were coming here and it's all just a silly
miscommunication problem.  But he still says comeon over any time I
want.  So awesome.  I'm sorry that I didn't plan ahead well
enough.</p>

<p>He told me about <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com">t-mobile</a>,
which apparently offers a tri-band phone that can be used all over the
world for $60/month or so.  I will certainly be getting a new phone
when I slide over to Japan next year.  I wonder if people will be able
to call a US number and get my in Japan.  And have my Japan peeps call
a Japanese number and get me in Japan, or the US.  That would be fly.
Or fuck the Japan vs US numbers and have a worldwide numbering system
(IP address, or better IPv6 address) to get to a particular phone.
Ultra fly.</p>
