<p class=date>12:53am CST Tuesday 29 October 2002</p>

<p>Josephine and Janette invited me to pile into bed with them while
Josephine told us all about the rally.  I most enjoyed her description
of Silent Football, which I found to be hilarious!  I forget the best
part, but let me assure you, it was great.</p>

<p>I pinched Joey a bit with my toes and tried to tickle her but she
was pretty much too strong.  Josephine was all "mom, Rob's being mean
to me!" and Janette goes, "Rob, don't get your sister all riled up
before bed..."  Funny.</p>

<p>So glad that the weekend was wonderful.</p>
