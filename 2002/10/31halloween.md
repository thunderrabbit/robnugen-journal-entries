<p>Okay, I've got on Janette's bathrobe and an apron.  Ready or not
here we come!</p>

<p>Heehee!  Went to a few houses.  Most had no candy left.  One had
candy both times that we visited.  The second time we visited, she
gave me candy and a Coors Lite.  Beer.  No kidding.  Even after I
said, "nah, no thanks," when she offered.</p>
