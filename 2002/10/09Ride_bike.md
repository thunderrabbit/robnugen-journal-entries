<p class=date>10:02pm EDT Wednesday 9 October 2002</p>

<p>Today I rode my bike for about an hour on a bike trail near
campus.  The trail is not raw dirt as I suspected, but smooth asphalt
about 5 feet wide, with stop signs at street intersections and guard
rails along deep ditches.</p>

<p>The highlight of the ride was a railroad tressel above the bike
trail.  I hauled my bike through thick brush and briars up the hill to
the tracks.  Rode along the tracks across both tressels (one goes over
the bike trail, the other goes over a street) and it was pretty neat.
The um, the tressel over the street had a sign on it, something like
BUILT BY KING BRIDGES 1906.  The date is the only thing I remember for
certain.</p>
