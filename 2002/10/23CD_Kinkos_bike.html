<p>Took Scott to Kinko's where I read livejournal.  Ryan and Jackie
are funny verbally ripping at one another.  Read about those cats
hostaging an entire theater of other cats in Moscow (?).  Yikes,
stripes!</p>

<p>I can tell I'm not emotionally invested in that situation, but I
agree it's pretty fucked up.</p>

<p>Also got to chat with Maggie a bit.  It's so apparent to me that
she is so much better off without John.  She's completely excelling in
many areas of her life.  Such a relatively short grieving period for
her as well.  I'm amazed and thrilled.</p>

<p>I hope John is doing well as well.</p>

<p>Back home and then rode my bike to CD World to get the Uncle
Kracker self titled CD for Janette.  She said she really liked his
music and hoped I would too.  I'm listening to the second song on the
CD now.  I pretty much do not like it.  Good thing I bought it for
her, not for myself.</p>
