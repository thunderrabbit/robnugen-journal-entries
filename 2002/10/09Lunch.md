<p class=date>12:11pm EDT Wednesday 9 October 2002</p>

<p>This morning Abbey led me through the process of barging into the
kitchen to munch eggs for breakfast.  I'm still not totally confident
in this co-op environment, so I offered to help the lunch cook
cook.</p>

<p>Renee was the lead cook with help from two or three others plus me.
We prepared a lovely "all vegan meal of curried okara and (cute!)
peas, baked squash (prize if you can name the types), steamed spinach
and garlic sauce, brown rice" as I wrote on the menu for the meal.</p>

<p>I'm super glad to be helpful in the co-op and feel much better
about munching with them.</p>

<p>At this moment, Abs is (checking email, but she was) transcribing
notes from a class.  Lunch begins at 12:20 (just a few minutes).</p>
