<p>I forgot to mention that while we played the string game, Sarah
picked up the cat and tossed him onto my hand.  Funny stuff.</p>

<p>We went for a long walk today, which started as a run down the golf
course, basically chasing two guys in a golf cart for a while.  Each
time they would get out of their cart to hit some balls, I would have
Sarah stop so as to not intrude on their game.  Each time they would
take a practice swing, she would giggle and say "he missed it" and
then when he hit the ball she would say "oooh good hit!"  Funny.</p>

<p>We walked all the way to the front of the subdivision and then
walked across the tressel of the railroad track and heard a train
coming so we stepped off to the side (we were well past the tressel)
and waved to the engineer who waved back.</p>

<p>During the walk she kept saying, "I can't believe that I walked
this far!!!" and I invited her to test to see if she was dreaming by
trying to fly.  I wonder if she'll remember to test while she's
dreaming now and fly in her dream.</p>

<p>We headed back after feeding grass to the bravest of a heard of
cows, who were probably being wary of the electric fence in which they
were caged.  The fence was actually wooden, with one electrified wire
that Sarah accidentally touched and then somehow <em>somehow</em>
talked me in to touching.  Ow!!!!  That was pretty funny that she was
able to do that.</p>

<p>I piggybacked her about 1/4 of the way home, and she was asleep
soon after we got back.  Becky was getting pretty worried since it was
relatively dark by the time we got back.</p>

<p>Great great great stuff!</p>
