<p>I heard Sarah and Barbie awake, getting Sarah ready for school.  I
realized I needed to tell Sarah bye, since I'll be gone before she
gets back from school.  I gave her a hug as she was headed out toward
the bus.  "I'll be leaving today while you're at school."</p>

<p>"Shoot.  Now I won't be able to play wif you when I get home."</p>

<p>"Yeah."  <em>Holy shit I cannot believe she took it that well.</em>
"Okay, have a good day at school, buddy."  I've been calling her buddy
a lot and can't really explain why.</p>

<p>I thought she would throw in my face that we hadn't taken another
walk that I promised.  I thought there would be much wailing and
gnashing of teeth.  Nope.  Only "shoot" and I'm thankful.</p>

<p>I think she'll be pretty much at least in high school when I see
her again.</p>
