<p>Janette made bread tonight and while it cooked, I read to her most
of the first 6 chapters of <em>Stranger in a strange land</em>, which
I have never previously read.  According to the preface, this version
is from the original transcript, not the one that was originally
published in 1960-something.</p>

<p>Pretty good story.</p>

<p>I appreciate that it was written over a long period of time.  That
helps me have hope for <em>The Past is Now</em>.</p>
