<p class=date>5:01am CDT Sunday 20 October 2002</p>

<p>Tonight we watched <em>Deep Blue Sea</em> and <em>Dead Poets
Society</em>.  I had seen DPS, but not DBS.  DPS was better.  but Erik
certainly liked DBS.</p>

<p>He and Amelia argued about its merits.  Amelia went to bed before
we started DPS.</p>

<p>I'm going to bed now too.  Know why?  I'm tired.</p>
