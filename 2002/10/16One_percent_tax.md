<p>I just bought a 99 cent thing of travel shampoo (after leaving my
first shampoo in Austin, and my second one in Kalamazoo) for 100
cents.  When the girl said, "one dollar,"  I was all, "what's your tax
rate around here?"</p>

<p>"7.5 percent."  She examined the receipt.  "But you only got
charged 1 percent tax for this."</p>

<p>"Do you have any idea why?"</p>

<p>"Nope," she smiled, "no idea."</p>

<p>I'm not complaining.  "Okay, have a great day!"</p>
