<p>Hahahhaahahh</p>

<p>Pete's Jokes per Minute ratio is pretty high.</p>

<p>"You'll see a restaurant that got closed down because a firetruck
ran into it..."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"Hang around for five minutes and then leave [to meet Pete at
lunch]"</p>

<p>"Actually I'll leave now and get lost for five minutes with your
crazy directions and then be there."</p>

<p>"Okay, you do whatever you want, and I'll be there at 11:30."</p>

<p>Lunch was great; we shares stories and joked about random stuff as
usual.  Pete paid for lunch; I'm thankful for that, and for such a
lovely fun time.  He gave me directions to his mom's work at the end
of lunch.</p>
