<p>Excellent.  So glad that <a

it</a> quite so well.</p>

<p>Janette and I went with Johnny Wolf, the owner of The Wolf Shop (sp
on Wolf?), where I have gotten some work during my adventure.  He's a
pretty laid back cat, so it seems.  Janette has known him for a while
and they were definitely joking around a lot in the same sorta way
that points out ironies in the world and in ourselves.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Anyway, the movie fucking ruled.  But it made me just like,
embarassed to be an american.  I wonder if that's why I'm running off
to Japan?  On some level, yes.  I'm sick of the US and policies and
its fucking bullshit way of bullying around other countries.</p>

<p>The summary of US history was great and horribly sad, and oh so
true.  fucked up shit.</p>

<p>I'm glad that Michael Moore was able to do something good during
the making of the movie.  Congratulations to him.</p>

<p>My mind was thoroughly taken off of my missing the San Antonio
Rally during the movie.  When we got out of the theater though, it hit
me again.</p>

<p>I began to cry outside of the bookstore where a series of
children's books featuring a girl named Kaya (name of Johnny's
daughter) caught Johnny's eye.  I can't explain why it hit me then,
but .. yeah, probably because I was thinking of youths in general.
Bang.</p>

<p>I could be at San Antonio now, listening to all your stories and
zaniness and all that.  I'm sorry to be forced to let you down.</p>
