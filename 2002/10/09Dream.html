<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>With my Aunt Madeleine in a parking lot at her car,
kinda inside a building with some water nearby, and she started to get
ill or fall under water and I couldn't really keep her afloat, so I
hollered at someone to call 911, but they ignored me, so I grabbed her
phone and called 911 while trying to keep her from sinking and the
operator was all, "you have to call a different number" and she
wouldn't connect me.  I got really mad and was all, "just fucking
connect me to the number; my aunt is fucking drowning here!"</p>

<p class=dream>She never connected me, but some lady saw our plight
and was willing to help, and put Madeleine in her van but left me in
the water, which was no problem cause I got out easily.</p>

<p>I'm glad it was a dream.</p>
