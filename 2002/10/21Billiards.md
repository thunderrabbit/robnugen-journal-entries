<p>Caught up on livejournal and news this morning.  Added Megan to my
friends list. After breakfast of yummy bagel, cream cheese, orange
juice and pear, I played pool with Lee Ann (sp), two games, both of
which she won.  Now I'm off to Dallas.</p>

<p>This has been a great and excellent journey.</p>
