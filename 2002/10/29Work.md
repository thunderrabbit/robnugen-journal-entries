<p class=date>10:20am CST Tuesday 29 October 2002</p>

<p>At work now; I've been here a bit over an hour.  They've been here
a bit over 2 hours.  Um, I got to screw hinges into the back of the
big panels that cover the back of the 'cave'.  Joe (who I keep calling
Roy because I was talking with Roy a lot yesterday and because he
looks a lot more like a Roy than Roy does) helped some and now I'm
helping him bolt the hinges to the facade.  Have to poke the nut
driver (huh huh you said 'poke the nut') through styrofoam so the bolt
will reach it.</p>

<p>Lunch of dos burritos pollos con queso for two dollars including
tax.  Special thanks to Johnny for loaning me lunch money since I
left my wallet in El Segundo.  Actually at The Bibby's</p>

<p>I helped Joe with some more nut poking and stuff before lunch.</p>

<p>This group is pretty fun to work with.</p>

<p>Work is over.  Fun stuff.  I took some pictures with Janette's
camera cause she couldn't find mine.</p>
