<p>Sarah and I embarked on a walk pretty much as soon as she woke up
around 9 or 10am.  I had just cooked a pizza, so I folded it in half
and we both ate on it like a pizza sandwich while walking down the
golf course.  Discovered Jeff on the course; actually he saw Sarah
first and she gave him a big o' hug and Jeff and I just started
talking.</p>

<p>I helped him hang a shelf in the garage, helped him and his wife
Bevin bring in groceries when she got home, helped watch Sarah and
Keely (22 months old) play in the yard.  Sarah attached a shoulder
strap to her shirt and had Keely lead her around like a dog.
Seriously.  It was quite cute.</p>

<p>Keely fed the fish (two little resilient striped fish above the
kitchen sink) and then fed them a teaspoon of cinnamon and sugar.
Bevin was all, "yikes stripes!" (actually that's Wende's phrase, but
it fits the situation exactly) and I took a picture with their camera
to capture a moment from The Day Keely Poured Cinnamon and Sugar Into
The Fish Bowl.  Hahahaha funny.</p>

<p>We ate lunch then ice cream in cones.  Jeff cleaned up the garage
and expressed his thanks that I had helped him get started; he had
been wanting to do that for months.  Totally absolutely fantastic and
my pleasure to be helpful.</p>
