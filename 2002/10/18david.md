<p>I have just called the number in the phone book for David, my best
friend from 1st grade.  It's his old line and is now used as his mom's
comptuer line, but still has his name on it in the phone book.  She
gave me his phone number in Scottsdale AZ!</p>

<p>According to her, he's a chef now.  Totally awesome!</p>
