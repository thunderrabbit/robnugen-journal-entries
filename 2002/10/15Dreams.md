<p>My dreams featured Jennifer from Paint This!, in a big new store,
and a customer that was trying to hit on me or something.</p>

<p>Fred showed up in a later dream; he was also on a road trip, and
jokingly asked me if I wanna race.  I was all "sure," and held my
hands side by side like two cars and then made them drive off
quickly... in opposite directions.</p>

<p>I'm so funny, even in my sleep.</p>
