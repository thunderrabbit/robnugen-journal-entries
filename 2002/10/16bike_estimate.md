<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>The cats at Illinois Cycle sell new rotors for $65.  My $40 doesn't
quite cover that.</p>

<p>I feel sad and wonder what is the lesson I get for blessing that
cabbie's life and letting him off with giving me $40.</p>

<p>The wheel is bent as well.  I'm hoping I can fix that without
buying a new wheel.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>I'm going to shop around for a new rotor.  They say that no other
place around here will have it, and that I can expect to pay at least
$35 for a new one.</p>

<p>Oh my gosh.  M&M Mom is going to buy me a new one.</p>

<p>I am so so so so thankful for that!</p>

<p class=date>4:40pm</p>

<p>My bike is at the shop (actually just the wheel) and I'm back at
Kinko's.</p>
