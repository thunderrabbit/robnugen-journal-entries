<p>So great that Maggie has come to visit!  Janette and I went in to
her work for some hours and cleaned up the sewing room and got some
barbecue (actually Laura has previously informed me, et. al. that it's
not barbecue unless there is barbecue sauce put on or something like
that, but I don't know what to call it otherwise) with delightfully
few utensils.  Scooping up beans with a paper plate and eating beans
and chicken with no silverware.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Anyway, Maggie had a relaxed non-time-constrained
non-map-constrained trip up here.  She arrived around 3 pm and we
yammered with Janette for a while and I called Rocky to invite him to
a haunted house.  Didn't tell him that Maggie was in town; wanted to
surprise him.  He couldn't go on such short notice, so Maggie and I
went to Rocky and Trisha's house to say HI to them.</p>
