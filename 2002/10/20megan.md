<p>So I'm at Megan's house.  Super thanks also to Megan and
<em>her</em> mom for letting me stay on such short notice</p>

<p>Ah, now I remember having met Megan's mom Lee-anne (sp).  We
chatted for a while; she asked about my trip and upcoming plans, and
told me about her brother's new job as the intake nurse at the local
jail and about the awesomeness of their house (originally built in
1938, then moved to this location when Loop 244 was built), which they
have been expanding and remodeling.  Nice.</p>

<p>Ahhh fuzzy flannel sheets.  So perfect.  Thank you so much!</p>
