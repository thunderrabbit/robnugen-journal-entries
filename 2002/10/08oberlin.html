<p>As I drove to Oberlin, Eminem kept me pretty effectively awake.  I
noticed that on my way to Columbus, I was all tired tired oh so tired
and then put the tape in and *bang* I was awake!   Then I got tired
again even with the tape on.</p>

<p>Same thing on the way to Oberlin.</p>

<p>The trip was short; 2 hours, and I had relatively no problem
finding Abbey's house.  She was actually outside about to play croquet
when I drove up!</p>

<p>Played croquet with Abbey, Rachel, Betina, and someone whose
name starts with L (I think!) but I can't remember her name...</p>

<p>I got around the course first, including an amazing lucky streak
from the back post through four wickets in one turn!  It was so
totally wow and lucky.  My ball turned to poison first and I tried to
kill Rachel and Abbey, but Rachel hit my ball and then knocked it
through a wicket, killing my poison ball.  Betina ended up winning the
game.  Only Abbey's ball didn't turn to poison, but she was darn
close.</p>

<p>Lorraine is her name!  (Abbey just got back from her usually boring
Environmental Policy class)</p>

<p>After croquet, we munched at Keep co-op, which was a new experience
for me (not Keep, but co-ops at all).  I met Grecian during dinner and
then chatted with Bret and Abbey a bit after dinner.</p>

<p>I'm feeling at home no matter where I go on my trip.  Why is
that?</p>
