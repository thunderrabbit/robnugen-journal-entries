<p>Nowel's!!!!!</p>

<p>It's here! It's here!  But the building is vacated; I can just make
out the name of where the letters *used* to be.  This is where Fred
and David and I walked to see the lobsters on that afternoon turned
night.  We were watching the lobsters possibly longer than we
understood because it was on the edge of getting dark when we left.
Something like that.</p>

<p>Anyway, the building is still here!  The business has moved to
Nifong and/or Keene St.  (The sign says CLOSED   PLEASE SHOP OUR
NIFONG & KEENE ST. STORES.  THANK YOU!,  so I don't know if they have
two stores on two different streets (at what address, please?) or one
set of stores at the corner of those streets.)</p>

<p>What I can't tell from the sign is if it's Nowell's or Nowel's,
because there is simply a block where the L(s) used to be.  I dunno if
it was a stylized Ll or what.</p>

<p>Okay, now I'm going to find Ridgeway and see if anyone
knows/remembers Mrs Fails or Mrs Schuppe.</p>

<p>Ah.  Have just spoken with Lanny and Scott, chillin' in a truck in
the parking lot.  Scott comfirms that Nowell's is spelled with two l's.</p>

<p>Lanny has done body work on cars for 20 some years, but he's
looking to get out of it.  Possibly into computers, but doesn't know
where to start.  I invited him to email me for contacts.</p>
