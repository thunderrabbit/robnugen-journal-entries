<p>I just feel all poopypants, as Wende would say.  And I don't mean
diarrhea, although I did just eat 12 ounces of chocolate covered
cherries while I'm "trying" to work on Kim's website.</p>

<p>I've had an overall energy sucky lethargy that I can't seem to
shake.  I don't feel safe enough here to cry, but maybe I will when
Steve goes to dinner with his daughter tonight.  Aw fuck this just
sucks big crap.</p>

<p>Maybe I should just go to sleep for a while.  But then I feel
scared to miss Kim's phone call.  Fuck fuck fuck.  This is just
absolutely stupidity.</p>

<p>Today I learned there is a sauna in this house.  It's in the
basement.  I bet a sauna is a great place to cry.</p>

<p>Well, I didn't really cry, but I did fall asleep near a thermometer
reading 135 degrees F.  It was near me, but also right above the
heater.  I was next to the heater, so not quite as hot.  But I did
sweat after about 20 minutes.  I was in there for almost 1 hour.</p>

<p>I feel a tad better.  A tad.</p>

<p>Finally.  I bawled my eyes out as I wrote to Kim, telling him that
I don't really have anyone to talk to.  On some levels I feel so alone
out here on my grand adventure.  And that's just part of the package
that I've chosen for myself.  I definitely feel a lot better after
crying.  Good job me.</p>

<p>Still not perfect, but better.</p>
