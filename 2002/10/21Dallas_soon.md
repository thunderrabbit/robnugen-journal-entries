<p>Final leg of my eastern state trip begins.  I just got gas for
$1.379 per gallon.  3453 miles since Dallas.  146826 miles on Scott.
Apparently five hours drive down 75 to Dallas.  I'm thankful to be
home soon.</p>

<p>Home.  3705 miles round trip to Dallas.  Tired.  Sleep.</p>

<p>After cookies.</p>
