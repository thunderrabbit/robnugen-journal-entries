<p class=date>12:02pm EDT Friday 11 October 2002</p>

<p>I'm at lunch at Ali Baba's on Kalamazoo Mall, a brick one lane one
way street, the history of which was summarized on some concrete
podium base thing at one end of the street.</p>

<p>Weather is beautiful for walking bright sun through brilliant blue
sky and trees full of leaves considering the idea of changing hue for
the winter.</p>

<p>To order lunch I requested the "least expensive high protein meal;
I don't care what it is."  Result = a greek burrito with lamb,
tomatoes, pickles, lettus and some mystery sauce.</p>

<p>Lovely lunch.</p>

<p>I randomly started reading the phone book and found a page of
missing children "Have You Seen These Missing Children?"</p>

<p>Missing children is certainly no fun for everyone involved.  There
are lots of missing children in these surrounding states, I'm sure.</p>

<p>So why, oh why, is one of the missing children still featured here
when by now he is 29 years old?  He's 2 years younger than me, and has
been missing since he was 5 years old.  How possibly could this age
progressed picture be accurate?  How possibly would his family and him
have anything in common to talk about?  Any ties, any bonds, anything?
It just seems weird to me.</p>
