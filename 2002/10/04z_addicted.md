<p>I must be addicted to the internet.  Good job to Kate who has
decided to blow off livejournal and AIM for an unspecified period of
time.  It is just silly, but so goddamn addicting, and I can't really
figure out why.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Why is livejournal so interesting?  It's something about how it
lets me feel connected to these people's lives, how I can have some
insights on how they act around others, how I can maybe give some
helpful insight to them.</p>

<p>Now I'm reading my email and have been willing to wait wait wait
even though this internet connection is so fucking slow it's pathetic!
Damn this connection bites my butt.</p>

<p>Elizabeth and Becky are back in the garage, cleaning the place up.
They've really done an impressive job!</p>

<p>Why do people smoke?  Why can they be addicted to something that is
so obviously bad for them?  And why do cute girls smoke?  And guys for
that matter?  It's so fucking messed up.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
