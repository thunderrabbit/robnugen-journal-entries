<p class=date>12:20am EDT Friday 11 October 2002</p>

<p>I have just arrived!  Joana is going to give me a tour of campus.</p>

<p class=date>5:54am</p>

<p>Joana gave me a tour of campus and I told her stories, prompted by
names of cities so far on my trip.  At 2:15 or so she went to sleep
and then I fell asleep reading an interview of foreign affairs expert
Thomas Friedman in Rolling Stone.  Just woke up, finished the
interview, going back to sleep.</p>
