<p>I got lost in Michigan; I was driving north on 23, then at an
intersection with another highway, I literally couldn't tell that my
road kept going forward (there were no street lights), so I turned
quickly and attracted the attention of a Sherrif, and then when I U
turned across the highway maybe that doubly got his attention, and
then he says he pulled me over cause my bicycle is covering my license
plate.</p>

<p>I can't find proof of insurance that isn't expired... might have
thought that one through a bit better before leaving, eh (haha I'm in
Michigan, eh?)?</p>

<p>Um, he didn't worry about my lack of insurance, since the car is
registered in my name (found the registration and expired insurance).
Anyway, he let me go without a problem.</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>Whew!</p>
