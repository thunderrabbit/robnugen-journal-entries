<p class=date>2:12am EDT Saturday 5 October 2002</p>

<p>A woman came to the house looking for Jason, who went out with
Shane and someone else for the football game tonight.  The game
probably ended by 10pm; it's a high school football game.  They're
still not home even now at 2 am.</p>

<p>I invited her in and gave some input/ideas/etc from my standpoint
as a youth advisor and as an ex teenager.  This felt really weird to
me to be giving advice to a mom on how to raise her kid, not just
because I don't have kids, but because he is her 3rd of 4 kids.  How
can I give helpful advice to someone like that?  I dunno, but she
seemed quite appreciative of my insights.</p>

<p>She stayed for 30 minutes at least; Becky and Elizabeth came in
from the garage and extended the conversation to TV stations and
such.  Very interesting all the different aspects we have of our
lives.</p>
