<p class=date>5:51pm CDT Friday 25 October 2002</p>

<p>Today I suddenly was missing <a href="http://www.ktru.org">KTRU</a>
a lot, so I turned them on via their internet stream.</p>

<p>Listened to a few DJs that I don't know at all or don't really
know, and then Meg and Heather came on.  I know Meg; she's the DJ who
took my application when I turned it in all those years ago.  I know
Heather; she was the station manager at that time.</p>

<p>Anyway, I called them to say HI and during the conversation learned
that today is Meg's birthday and that she was born in 1976, year of
the dragon.  I was all, "uh oh, according to the Chinese calendar, you
and I won't get along <em>at all</em>."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"yeah."</p>

<p>"Hmm.  Well, Dragons are better than dogs."</p>

<p>"Dragons are <em>bigger</em> than dogs, but not better.  Dogs are
loyal and.." I cut myself off.  "Wouldn't it be funny if during the
course of this conversation it went to shit and we hated each other
after that?"</p>

<p>"Definitely."</p>

<p>"Dogs are loyal and obedient.  Dragons are big and scary."</p>

<p>"Does it say that?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure it doesn't say that about dragons, but .. I'm saying
that [as a dog]."</p>

<p>I subsequently invited her to my 12,000th day party.  It will be a
blast.</p>
