<p>Chatting with Elizabeth, a cute college girl friend of Barbie's who
is over just to visit.  She looks a lot like Marcel's Kayse. She and
Becky were talking and smoking in the kitchen, so I stayed out of the
stink in the living room.</p>

<p>Elizabeth and I have been talking about travel; she's been to parts
of Europe: Germany, Paris, Switzerland I think.</p>

<p>She's a journalism major in school, specializing in public
relations.  I had to ask her how that was part of journalism, but now
I understand.  When she retires from her career, she wants to take
pictures for National Geographic.  I wonder why she doesn't make that
her career.</p>

<p>She says she just doesn't see that as a career, but more of a
hobby.  But why not get paid for what you love?</p>
