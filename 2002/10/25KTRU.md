You are hereby invited to the First Annual Third and Final EAS Training
Session, this Saturday in the month of October on the day of the
twenty-sixth in the year of two thousand two.  The event will be a proper
event for gentlemen and gentlewomen of good standing and good taste, so
for those of you planning on "partying 'til the cows come home" on
Saturday, please do not bring any of that behavior to the training
session.  That means no "booty shaking" no "O.P.P.'ing" and for those
planning on going to NOD, no "showing off what God gave you".  Thank you
for your consideration.

What?

You don't want shaving cream smeared all over the consoles?  No boob
prints on the windows?  No silly string decorating the station and no
beer on our 40+ year old vinyl????

<p>His reply made me laugh.  Actually laugh out loud.</p>

                                      .... i thought it'd be fun to make
people extra aware that at KTRU, we expect only the most proper and polite
behavior, and anything suggestive or risque, like those horrible sex
pistols or some band with a name like jackie-o-motherfucker, will simply
not be tolerated!!!
