<p>Just played disc with Maggie, Sean, Hart, Janette and I plus five
discs.  We started out playing Disc Cover and then changed to golf and
then just tossing them around at the park.</p>

<p>I got bored of disc and went to the swings and Hart jumped out of a
swing and landed wrongly and nearly bonked his head on a concrete
border on the playground.  Scary for a second.</p>

<p>I climbed all over the playground equipment and slid down the wet
slide and almost fell backwards, but landed only on my feet.  I
crouched lower the second time I went down and Maggie + Janette said
it looked much more graceful and like a surfer.  Nice.</p>

<p>I tried an upside down thing on the playground and bonked my head
slightly.  Oww.. that wasn't planned.</p>

<p>I went upside down on another thing and had my hands locked so that
if I had fallen over (and I nearly did), I would have likely sprained
or broken <em>both</em> my wrists at the same time.  Wow.  That would
have been amazing.</p>

<p>I discovered a tree nearby and climbed up and around its branches,
wondering what it would be like as a squirrel, leaping effortlessly
from branch to branch.  I wasn't so effortless, but still had a good
time.  Gave the tree a big hug after I jumped down.  I appreciate
trees and their patience.</p>
