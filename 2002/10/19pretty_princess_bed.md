<p>I get to sleep in Amelia's old room tonight, on a Pretty Princess
Bed.  I'm sure this style has a name other than that, but it's
basically shaped topologically like a couch with with iron sides and
back to keep me from falling out at night.  Very pretty and very
princessey. </p>

<p>Good night.  I'm tired.</p>
