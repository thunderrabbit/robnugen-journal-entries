<p>Jack didn't drive, but went with me as we visited the video store
just before the closed.  I sped a bit and didn't have a wreck with a
car that cut the corner that I was hoping to cut at the same time.</p>

<p>I'm impresed with the cat in the video store who was able to
identify the name of the movie with a cover image that shows the back
of a girl walking into a party while she's holding a knife behind her,
and her hair is braided into a loop/noose shape: <em>April Fool's
Day</em>, which we are watching now.</p>

<p>Just finished the movie.  It's pretty spooky and cheesey and spooky
all at once.  Eeeek.  I promised Janette never to April Fool's her to
that extreme.  Jack got a phone call during the movie and missed most
of it.</p>
