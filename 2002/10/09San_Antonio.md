<p>I might not go to San Antonio Rally, for reasons that I choose not
to disclose at this moment, or ever maybe.  Well, maybe in ten
years.</p>

<p>I think it has nothing to do with some people who spoke to Steve
through Jennifer Nichols-Payne, and who spoke to me through Doug
Strong.  I do intend to be at Houston Rally.</p>

<p>I feel sad about not going.  Some youth have specifically asked
about me going and I've been saying yes, but now I might not be.</p>

<p>Poop.  I have trouble seeing the goldenness in this, which I trust
is part of all things in my life.  But I'm still looking and
trusting..</p>

<p>Okay, I've decided I'm not going.  This decision gives me the
freedom to not worry about being back in time for the rally just to
find out that I cannot attend.</p>

<p>Makes sense to me.</p>
