<p>I'm watching Comedy Central now.  Standup comedy.  Heehee.</p>

<p>Tamara just came home and offered to let me sleep on the bed in the
room behind her room.  Awesome.  Plus it has internet access so I can
read google news and livejournal.</p>

<p>I just watched <em>Porn N Chicken</em>, Comedy Central's first
original movie.  Cute, and interesting that the main character's big
finale was to drive to California with no agenda.  Kinda like me?
Maybe, I guess.</p>
