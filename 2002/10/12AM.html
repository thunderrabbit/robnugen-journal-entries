<p>Joana didn't wake up until like 11:30am, which is apparently quite
late for her.  I was chatting with her suitemate Meagan, encouraging
her to do a study abroad in Australia, or actually anywhere.  She's
currently considering either Australia, Spain, Ecuador, or not going
at all.</p>

<p>Joana and their other suite mate came in and we (mostly they) all
chatted and gossipped about stuff and things.  Meagan was studying
spanish, and is now studying organic chemistry out on campus
somewhere.</p>
