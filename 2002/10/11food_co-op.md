<p>Super awesome thanks to Jenny at <a
href="https://www.peoplesfoodco-op.org">People's Food Co-op</a>,
downtown Kalamazoo's only natural grocer who bought me an apple for
lunch.</p>

<p>I went inside when I saw "food co-op" thinking, that's exactly what
I need!  But they often work on a scale more like lots and lots of
food, like word for an hour and get 5% off $100 worth of food
purchased or something like that.  I was all, "hmm. I was hoping more
along the lines of ones of dollars instead of hundreds of
dollars."</p>

<p>She bought me an apple without anything expected in return.  I'll
write her a letter from somewhere.</p>
