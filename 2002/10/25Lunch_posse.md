<p class=date>12:46pm CDT Friday 25 October 2002</p>

<p>Josephine, Tara, Logan, Julia, Ellen, Amanda all came over for
lunch, gossip, old picture gawking, and physics homework.</p>

<p>I'm impressed and pleased that the school is making use of internet
in what seems to be a logical way.  They have homework assignments
available via pdf files, and they can turn in their answers online.
Cool thing is that each student has basically the same assignment, but
with different numbers filled in so they can't cheat by copying
answers.  They would have to actually explain the techniques used to
get the answer.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Tara fell asleep and Ellen went in to Josephine's room hollering,
"wake up wake up wake up!!!"</p>

<p class=date>2:14pm</p>

<p>They just left and I've mostly cleaned up the kitchen after they
left it a mess.</p>
