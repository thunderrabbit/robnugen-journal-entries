<p>Wow.</p>

<p>Annoying, brilliant, charismatic, deadbeat, enigmatic,
free-spirited <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/mynameisryan/">Mr. Ryan
McCarthy</a> is suddenly and gloriously alive in New York.  Not that
he was never alive since I've known him, but he's apparently thriving,
or just beginning the grandest <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/mynameisryan/day/2002/10/05">greatest
adventure</a> of his life.</p>
