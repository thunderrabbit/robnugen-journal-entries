<p>I've just arrived at M & M's mom's house, just as Eminem's "Lose
Yourself" came on the radio, so I listened to that first.  Excellent.</p>

<p>I've been here like two minutes and she's cooking me pork chops and
potatoes.</p>

<p>Kathy came over for a while (mom's oldest daughter) and chatted
some.  I started to get really sleepy and went downstairs to sleep,
but now I've been doing email for over an hour.  Got 8 messages
written.  Awesome.</p>

<p>I found out where there's a local 24 hour Kinko's.  I'll go there
when I wake up in 7 hours or so.</p>
