<p>Super awesome special thanks to Calder and her mom for getting me a
place to sleep, and leading me to the place to sleep tonight.</p>

<p>Calder's mom seems really cool and patient and funny and able to
deal with inanity around her.  Five minutes in the house turned to 30
minutes of animated conversation and billiard ball rolling plus five
minutes of coaxing Calder out the door and into the car with all her
stuff.</p>

<p>I'm so thankful for the quick turnaround Calder did on getting me a
place to stay.</p>

<p>AND(!) ("there's more?") she got me a funny book with a funny name
and a gay pride kitten made of those round melty bead things!
Awesome.  I think I know just the person who will love the cat.</p>

<p>Hugs to Calder's mom and Calder as they left.</p>
