<p class=date>9:26pm CST Monday 28 October 2002</p>

<p>I'm registering for Fall Conference and for Youth Advisor Training.
At Kinko's with NIN CD _Broken_ <em>blasting</em> in my headphones.
How wonderfully relaxing...  :-) aahhhh</p>

<p class=date>9:55pm</p>

<p>Okay, I have just emailed my information to the two registrars.
Hopefully that will be sufficient. I'll call them tomorrow if I
haven't heard back maybe.</p>

<p>Barbie/Becky were snailing my calendar to me at the Bibby's, but I
haven't gotten it yet.  Hmmm.</p>
