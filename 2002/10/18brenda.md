<p>I just talked with Brenda at D&H; smilingly told her of my
adventures at Ridgeway.  When I said, "the principal is Mrs Fales, my
first grade teacher... and she remembered me!" a wave of sadness
washed over me..</p>

<p>But not sadness exactly, more like "wow I can't believe she
actually remembered <em>me</em>" feeling of relief, disbelief,
amazement. I'm not sure what to call it, but I wasn't willing to cry
in the store; I held it back.</p>

<p>Thank you Brenda for being a smiling mirror for my adventure.
Thank you for your encouragement to write to the Tribune.</p>
