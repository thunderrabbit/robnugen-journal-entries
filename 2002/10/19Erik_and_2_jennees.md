<p>I'm in Springfield and Amelia and Erik's house.  Erik was
unimpressed with my Mac until he really started looking at it.  I told
him I wouldn't tell anyone, so um, nevermind.</p>

<p>He got a phone call and hung up saying, "soon there will be two
Jenni's here."</p>

<p>"You can't go wrong with two Jenny's," I agreed.</p>

<p>At this very moment there are 2 Jenni's sitting on Erik and
tickling him, as he tries in vain to squirm away.  Wow, how can one
guy endure such torture?</p>

<p>hahahaha</p>

<p>Erik is a big guy.  Each Jenny is about half his mass.  What a
funny sight!</p>

<p>Now, Jenny wants Erik to do errands with her and Jenni wants Erik
to magically have already downloaded some anime for her.  Jenny was
pouting gloriously while Jenni was griping that he wasn't ready to go
yet.</p>

<p>"It's not fair for both of you to be mad at me at the same time!"</p>
