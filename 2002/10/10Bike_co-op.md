<p>Wow.  For only $6 per semester, people can join the bike co-op,
have full access to all their tools and get parts at cost.  My bike
had a warp in the big front chain ring, and a broken spoke, so I
visited the co-op to get it fixed.</p>

<p>The warp in the chain ring was trivial to fix.  block of wood,
mallet, <em>bang</em>, it was fixed.</p>

<p>The spokes took a bit longer.  Turns out that two spokes were
broken on my back wheel, and they were broken on the right hand side,
so I had to remove the freewheel (set of gears in the back) to replace
the spokes.  Once I got the freewheel off, I discovered that of the 8
spokes on that side, 2 were broken, and 6 were ready to break.  The
culprit was that the chain would sometimes go off the freewheel, past
first gear.  I would still force it to pedal until it got back into
place, but that wore through the spokes pretty effectively.</p>

<p>It would have taken some time to find eight spokes the correct
length, but with a volunteer working on sorting the spokes they had,
it was simple for me to get them the correct length.</p>

<p>Replaced the spokes (a first for me), trued the wheel (made it
straight) (a first for me), replaced the freewheel (a first for me
(not that I had removed one before)), replaced the wheel.  Totally
totally awesome for only six bucks.</p>

<p>Thank you, Bike Co-op!!</p>
