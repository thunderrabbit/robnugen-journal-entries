<p>Downstairs in the free (!) laundry facilities of this dorm.  Wow.
Plus there are ethernet connections on the wall here (outside the
laundry room in the lounge), but they seem not to work.</p>

<p>The three washers are being used now, so I'll just reply to email
while I'm waiting.</p>

<p class=date>2:19pm</p>

<p>Laundry is done.  I got seven emails written.</p>
