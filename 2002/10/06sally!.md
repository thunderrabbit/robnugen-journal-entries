<p class=date>11:36pm EDT Sunday 6 October 2002</p>

<p>During <em>The Fast and The Furious</em>, which we watched after
<em>Silence of the Lambs</em> on Showtime (?), Sally called me!</p>

<p>"Sally?" after I saw the phone number on their caller ID.  Totally
jumped up to run outside and talk with her.  I'm so in love.</p>

<p>Told her that my second stop from now will be Oberlin and she
totally shared all these cool stories of peeps and places and co-ops
and everything awesome up there since she went to Oberlin for graduate
school I think. (that was when I barely knew her)</p>

<p>Wow!  I had totally forgotten she had been there and was thrilled
to get all this inside information.  I will write her a letter from
the campus and send it to her.  That reminds me that I never finished
my letter to Bryn that I started in OKC.  Silly Rob.</p>

<p>I have only sent one (1) letter since I've been on my adventure,
and that was to Marta cause I owed her some money.</p>

<p>Sally is going to Cuba from 3-13 November to experience the Havanah
Drum Festival, which will certainly be totally unbelievably awesomely
excellent.  I greatly look forward to hearing those stories!</p>

<p>At the end of the conversation, cut short only because she had to
go drop off a friend at LAX, I told her I really look forward to the
opportunity to date her.  I really want to know if we could spend a
lot lot lot lot lot of time together in the future.  Sally is so
awesome!</p>
