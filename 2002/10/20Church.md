<p>I came to church with Amelia today just to talk to Kellie about a
question she asked me via email.  I ended up talking instead with aw
man I forgot her name, the DRE.  I hopefully gave her some helpful
thoughts and insights.  Didn't get to talk super long, but hopefully
it helped.</p>

<p class=date>12:21pm</p>

<p>Amelia and I just walked Magic (the dog) around the neighborhood
and she queried me on how I've found my balance between being a youth
and an advisor.  I told her that it took awhile for me to find the
balance and that now I have been driven by at least two different
thoughts:</p>

<p>!) YRUU is my priority over all other activities.</p>

<p>@) I have no ego in YRUU.</p>

<p>Number (!) above might sound weird considering I'm not going to San
An, but ultimately I trust this is better for the youth, though it's
hard for me to see that now.</p>

<p>Number (@) above is true in the following way: if the YRUU activity
is truly being run by youth (and doesn't violate the community agreed
rules) I don't care what the activity is.</p>

<p>There are certainly other driving factors that guide my involvement
with YRUU, but those are two that stand out for me.</p>
