<p>Talking to Janette, telling her about how awesome Sally is to me.
She asked several questions about her and our relationship.</p>

<p>Janette wondered aloud of how we can stay on the right side of the
line of using people too much, and being completely self sufficient
and not talking to other people at all.  I suggested that this answer
would be different for everyone, and would even change for a
particular person from moment to moment.</p>

<p>We were yammering about Sally when she (Sally) called me back!</p>
