<p>I'm leaving Oberlin now.  Just gotta get my shiznit packed and go.
I've already given Abbey a hug; she's in a meeting now with some peeps
about a wack situation where The Man is trying to shut down Abbey's
Peeps' operation if it doesn't conform to blablablah.</p>

<p>Good luck to Abbey et. al. on that.</p>
