<p>Jack was home when we got home and Jackie came over soon
thereafter!  Jackie is greatly contemplating shaving her head; she's
been thinking about it for a while and Chez's shaving helped finalize
the decision.  Jackie's parentals are having some concerns, but Jackie
has a pretty good argument for it.  I helped her practice what she
would say to them.</p>

<p>Jackie has called Jack twice tonight since she left.  I wonder what
they are cooking up...</p>
