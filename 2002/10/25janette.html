<p>Talking with Janette helped a lot tonight.  I'm thankful for her as
a true friend.</p>

<p>(I'm thankful also to Maggie, who is willing to drive up to see me
tomorrow.  Another true friend.)</p>

<p>Janette is doing yoga stretches now.  I'll offer to read more of
Stranger in a Strange Land when she's done.</p>
