<p>Two dorms competed in volleyball outside and Joana got me grab and
run on her board card.  I played the first prequel game that didn't
count and it was way fun.  During the best of three competition,
Crissey (Joana's dorm) won the first game 21 - 17, then they lost 21 -
4, then lost 21 - 17.  Awesome fun, just like my college days!</p>
