<p>Last night Janette and I worked at her work for some hours, but I
think she was getting tired because she made an error (forgetting to
measure a thing before sewing (she assumed it was the correct length))
so we went home before the job was complete.</p>

<p>I'm going back to her work this morning, which thankfully will
become my work too; Johnny has offered me about two weeks worth of
work there.  I'm really thankful for that!</p>

<p>Hahah exactly 12.5 hours later...</p>

<p>So, um work was good today; i enjoy the variety.  I helped Janette
put on some grommets and then loaded up some cloth into a barrel and
then painted purple paint onto some large sheets of styrofoam cut to
look like rocks.  Then I cleaned up two distinct sections of the
woodshop area.  The first I just basically swept and restacked some
boards.  Second area was more involved because some of the wood had
been damaged by water.  I threw away some of that wood and in some
cases used the table saw to trim off the water damaged sections.  I
screwed together some 2x4s with some 1x4s to make a rudimentary wood
stacking place to keep it up out of the water.</p>

<p>Then I helped the guys building the stage structure thing on which
the rock facade will be placed.  (the purple is just an undercolor in
case the painters miss any rocks with rock colored paint) Big super
ultra sturdy structure of 2x2 square steel tubes and good quality 3/4"
plywood as flooring.  It's to be a permanent installation
apparently.</p>
