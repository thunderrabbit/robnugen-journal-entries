<p class=date>2:43am EDT Thursday 3 October 2002</p>

<p>Super tired.  I've been up reading a ton of livejournal entries,
and then reading my email via yahoo.  Message from Steve Feinstein
says he has heard rumors that some people are concerned about me not
having a church that I'm affiliated with and not having youth to bring
to the rally, but me still wanting to come to San Antonio Rally.</p>

<p>I plan to attend the rally, but I won't if Steve thinks it will be
a problem.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
