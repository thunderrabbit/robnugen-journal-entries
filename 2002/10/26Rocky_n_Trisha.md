<p>We laughed most all the way there, and had a lovely great time.
Mostly we just gossipped about Telecheck where we all met.  Watched a
bit of <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> which Brennan had on.</p>

<p>Tina P called from the San Antonio Rally; I'm so glad they are
having such great fun!  Said HI via Tina to all my peeps.</p>

<p>So awesome to see what great parents Rocko and Trisha are being.
Great to see them after so many years!</p>
