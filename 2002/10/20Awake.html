<p>Amelia and I are awake at 9 so that we may go to church today.  I'm
actually only interested in visiting the YRUU; Kellie, one of the
advisors asked for insights on getting youth to be respectful of one
another.  I can help more if I can see the situation or at least ask
some specific questions about the stories I hear.</p>

<p>I had dreams, and I think they involved being at the Bibby's in
Dallas, but I don't recall more than that.</p>
