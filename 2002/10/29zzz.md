<p>Janette read a short story to Jack and me.  I fell asleep after
like 2 minutes, I imagine.  I'm quite tired after working today.  Lots
of manual labor carrying around heavy stuff and drilling holes and
bolting bolts and generally working harder than I've worked in quite a
while.  Excellent.  Good night.</p>
