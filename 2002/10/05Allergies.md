<p>I have determined that my throat is sore and scratchy not because
I'm sick with a virus, but because my nose is snotting and draining
down my throat due to the cigarette smoke in this house.  Becky smokes
a lot.  Like she's smoking as often as not, possibly including when
she's sleeping.  Okay, maybe not, but maybe so.</p>

<p>I find it annoying at first, and disgusting after a while.  I'm
like holy shit, when are you going to stop smoking???</p>

<p>I've been reading Japanese today.  If Barbie doesn't make it to her
today, then I'll probably leave tomorrow.</p>
