<p>Over the past couple of days I have been reading <em>Stranger in a
Strange Land</em> to Janette.  She had read it a long time ago, and I
have never previously read it.</p>

<p>I seem to read just fine for an hour (?) maybe and then my eyes and
mouth seem to get desynchronized and/or just make up words.  But, I
made it through Part I of the book (8 chapters total in Part I), of
four Parts.</p>
