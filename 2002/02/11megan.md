Hi Megan

I don't have a TV, but when I'm at my friend Dude's
(*) house we seem to always be watching TechTV.  Good
thing too, cause I think you are amazingly
beautiful/cute/smiley/awesome.

Dude taunts me by saying, "she lives in Houston, you
know," which is a taunt because we also live in
Houston.

I am completely certain you have five million suitors
since TechTV certainly has a lot of viewers, so I'm
adding my name to the list.

You should go out with me because I'm single and
intend to stay that way, so I won't be a pest or a
leach.  I've been a computer programmer by trade for 5
years, but I'm shifting myself out of my career so I
can go travel around the world, which seems a lot more
real and meaningful than computers.

Instead of more computer languages, I'm learning
spoken languages - Spanish, French, Japanese, and
American Sign Language.
