<p>Today after work I'm going to San Marcos for dinner at Jason's new
restaurant.  I invited a couple of my friends, but no one can join
me.  So I invited my fam in Austin.  They'll meet me there, presumably
meet Jason, have great food and great fun.  Then Fred and I will chill
at his house and tell funny stories and such.</p>
