<p>I have disbanded the Ring for People Named Rob.  It was a cute
little thing to have around for a while, but there were only 6 Robs on
the ring, and none of them wanted to be the new ringmaster when I
decided to give up my role.</p>

<p>This Rob is the only one who actually replied to my email: <a
