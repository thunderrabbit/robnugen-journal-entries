<p>For some reason, it's <em>cold</em> today.  Like 34 degrees F, and
plenty of wind to make it feel like 20 few degrees.</p>

<p>Tonight it will actually be around 20 degrees and in the 10s north
and west of here.</p>

<p>Even so, I walked to work today.  But I did wear socks, shoes,
sweatpants, sweatshirt, my knit cap, and gilligan hat over my normal
attire.</p>
