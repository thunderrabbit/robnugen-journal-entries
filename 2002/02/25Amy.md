<p>So my latest cute girl friend person is Amy, who I barely know, but
she helps me laugh over AIM, and Dude assures me that she's cool, and
she knows French, and is relatively active outdoors-y type.  But I
really only know her in the context of work or online chat.</p>

<p>I wanna go out with her I think but I don't trust myself to keep
appropriate boundaries = no kissing, nothing more than a good hug or
so at the end.</p>

<p>I'd like to hang out with her at Dude's maybe, which would be a
good safe neutral place for us.  But there is no Wednesday night
dinner there this week, and I don't want to wait all the way until
next week...  argh.</p>
