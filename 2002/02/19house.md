<p>We have accepted an offer on our house.  I just signed the contract
and now <a href="http://www.jodilynn.net">Jodi</a> is going to fax it
back to the buyer's agent.</p>

<p>It wasn't for quite as many dollars as I had wanted, but Wende is
definitely ready to be out of the house, and Perry Homes has totally
flooded the market to the point that they are knocking off $15,000
from each home they sell.</p>

<p>I'm thankful that ours is not a Perry home.</p>
