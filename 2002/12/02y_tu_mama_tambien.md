<p>Just watched <em>Y Tu Mama Tambien</em>, which I really enjoyed.
American movies should be so free and expressive.</p>

<p>Just such.... depth of passion in their friendship and so
beautifully tragic to suddenly never see one another again, like the
guy who reaches the height of his life dream at age 25 and dies in a
plane crash flying to the next event.  How she knew but wouldn't tell,
and just chose to live her life dream until the final days.</p>

<p>So beautiful that the fishing family just took her in as a member
of their family.  No questions.  Full respect for her wishes.</p>

<p>So thankful to be living some of my life dreams now, with no
impending deadline.</p>

<p>Plus some of the scenes were just so hot.</p>
