<p>Just arrived at Jennifer's house, and she's not here.  She had to
zip over to the post office for a second; she left a message for me
about 11:10, 10 minutes after I said I would get there.</p>

<p>It took me longer to ride my bike here than I guessed.</p>

<p>I called her to find out that she'll be back in a few minutes.</p>

<p>I arrived just as it started raining.  San Francisco misty wussy
cold rain, not a Houston thoroughly pounding rain.</p>

<p>My bike is chained and cabled to a sign.  Bad guy would just have
to knock the sign off and lift my bike over the pole to get it off.
But the cable would still have to be cut to allow the wheels to roll.
I think I'll thread the chain through the spokes too.</p>

<p>There we go.  That's what I'm talkin' about.  Security.</p>

<p>Jennifer's neighbor needs to run off to pick up her grandson, and
asks if I'll stay here for PG&E (which, after working with GenXchange,
I happen to know stands for Pacific Gas & Electric) to come by.</p>
