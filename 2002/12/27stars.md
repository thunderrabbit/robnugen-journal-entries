<p>Woooahhhhhhh!!</p>

<p>A million jillion zillion stars!!!!!</p>

<p>Orion is like, completely coated in stars!  The big dipper is
pointing to a hundred stars, and not just the north star.  Pleiades
have tons of friends to play with!!  The Milky Way is overflowing.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I turned off Scott's lights, stood out in the middle of route 64,
just stared skyward.  So incredible.  Saw two shooting stars.</p>

<p>Wheeeee!!!</p>
