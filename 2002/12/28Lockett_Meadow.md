<p class=date>12:00pm PST Saturday 28 December 2002</p>

<p>I'm at Lockett Meadow now, a little parking area near the top of
the mountain, with four other cars here, counting the one that seems
to be leaving or lost.</p>

<p>I flipped a coin to decide whether to come here or go back to 84
and get back on my original planned path to Flagstaff.</p>

<p>I'm going to go walk around, and this time I'll bring my camera.</p>

<p>Fun.</p>

<p>Climbed way up a hill, had to use my four paw drive to get up.
Sliding on gravel and snow...  Chilled at the top of a bluff, but not
the top of the mountain.  Called Wende to say what's up.  (answer: me!
at 7500 feet!)</p>

<p>On the way down I tried to slide on my back, but the snow was too
soft to really get any speed.  Plus lots of trees and logs in the
way.  But, for the record, I would have invented snow skates after
this adventure, had they not already been invented.  I see them as
about 18 inches long and about a foot wide, super slick bottom and
rounded like a snowboard.  One for each foot, for extreme sliding
excitement!</p>

<p>Though I seem to have lost my hand drawn map, I drove right to the
parking lot of Kinko's in Flagstaff!</p>

<p>heehee; found my map; it was in my backpack.</p>
