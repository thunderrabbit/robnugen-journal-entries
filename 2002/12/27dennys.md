<p>Got gas.  No attendant at the station, so the restrooms were
locked.  However, Denny's next door restrooms were nice and clean.</p>

<p><em>Plus</em> there is a really attractive woman here behind the
counter.  She said HI nicely when I came in, and didn't seem to mind
that I was just using their facilities without buying anything.</p>

<p>So I'm back here at the counter to flirt with her and see if she
can help me answer my Grand Canyon Question.</p>

<p>Hahaha.  Annie, the other waitstaff person is funny.  Some cat
finished a dish just as she was asking for it, and she goes, "Oh I
love you... my dad loves you... my mom loves you... ... even my dog
loves you.." not even really talking to him, but just saying it in a
funny laid back voice.</p>

<p>Cute waitress says the Grand Canyon at sunset is one of the most
beautiful sights.  She hasn't seen it at sunrise, but she theorizes it
would also be quite beautiful.</p>

<p>Her name is Liz.</p>

<p>Annie says that I should go see the Grand Canyon.  That it will
look great in the morning with snow sprinkled around.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>So.  I'm outside Denny's in Scott, who's warming up.  I'm pretty
sold on going to see Grand Canyon.  I'm also a bit tired.  It will add
1+ hours each way (there and back here to get back to 40, for the
shortcut from Grand Canyon to Flagstaff is apparently quite dangerous
this time of year) and I'll need to watch for ice, deer, and elk.</p>

<p>I've decided to not flip coins.  I'm going to see the canyon.  But,
I won't hold myself to making it there tonight.  Just gotta get there
by sunrise.</p>

<p>5301 miles traveled since Dallas.  153802 miles on Scott.</p>

<p>Roll out.</p>

<p>Oh, the city I'm near is called Williams, elevation 6762 feet!!</p>
