<p class=date>2:14am PST Sunday 22 December 2002</p>

<p>(Computer didn't make it, so I had to call Dude to get the final
bit of directions to his house.)</p>

<p>Have arrived at Dude and Veronica's some hours ago.  Dude and I
have been watching TV while he's been playing Civilization on his
laptop.  My laptop has been charging, as it went to sleep hard and
wouldn't wake up before getting a battery boost.</p>

<p>Their house is nice.  Three stories and all that, plus hot tub in
the back.</p>

<p>We're going to see <em>Twin Towers</em> tomorrow at 7pm.  Good
stuff.</p>
