<p>WOW. (font as big as The Hollywood Sign)</p>

<p>Holy cow wow.  I'm at Emma Wood State Beach in California.  Waves
come in toward the rocks not like one wave in, one wave out.  But like
wave in, another wave in, two waves in, then all out.  Wave wave wave,
out out out.  The resulting variance in water depth is enough to make
me shout with delicious fear that I'm trapped in a water horror movie
where the water will keep piling up until it consumes my body like a
bit of fluff.</p>

<p>Wind relentless from the northwest, blowing away all my heat and
all my shouts of joy at this incredible sight.  And how much more
incredible would it be if the sun shone brightly overhead instead of a
3/4 moon worth of light?</p>

<p>I'm going to put more than T-shirt and shorts (and no shoes) on and
go back for more viewing.</p>

<p>Wow.  I got cold pretty quickly, even with hoodie on.</p>

<p>I don't want to leave.  Could there possibly be anything more
beautiful and awesome in the world?</p>

<p>I'm going to drive up the 1 now for a ways and get back on the 101
when it feels right.</p>
