<p>Been riding around Huntington Beach today, looking to purchase new
gloves, and new liner for my skate helmet.  I don't wanna buy a whole
new helmet cause I like the stickers on <em>this</em> helmet:

<p><ul>
<li>KTRU (black rightside up, yellow upside down)</li>
<li>Fly High Little Bunny ("Bunny" in the front and "Fly High" plus the
bat head in the back.)</li>
<li>Alien Workshop</li>
<li>NIN</li>
<li>ROCES Nuclear Power Under Your Feet</li>
<li>Senate</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Stopped in a few different shops and got new gloves from Seaside
Schwinn, and new helmet liner from Play It Again Sports. I like Play
It Again Sports owner, Sean (sp), who was quite customer service
conscious even while busy as fuck.  I commented on this, and he said
he took over the store some months ago, and profit has been going up
ever since.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Better personality, for one thing; taking care of the customers.
Plus not stealing from the store.  Little things like that...."</p>

<p>"hahah wow."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I've basically fired everyone who was working here - fired
six people in the last month."</p>

<p>"Rebuild your staff from the bottom up."</p>

<p>He doesn't have a website, but they're at the corner of Harbor and
Victoria in Costa Mesa.  949-548-7852.</p>

<p>My bike is ready.  Tightened the back brake.</p>
