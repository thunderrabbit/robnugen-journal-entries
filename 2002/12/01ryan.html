<p><a

ryan. mccarthy.</a> wrote an entry about how he's feeling like a big
slacker because he's not got a job, etc etc whatever, and wonders
something like, "but for every minute I spend learning something
valuable, do I have to watch five hours of Simpsons?"</p>

<p>I replied back something about how he is doing good stuff and then,
"Just because Socrates didn't watch Simpsons doesn't mean he didn't
chill."</p>

<p>Ryan must have thought I was pretty wise/clever.  He replied, "I'm
going to have this tattooed to my forehead."</p>
