<p>We hopped into the hottub which started at 106 degrees F and slowly
cooled to F 102 over a period of about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Dude and I remained in it the longest, but he, by far, had the
greatest amount of time in the water.  I was in and out, maintaining
my body temperature at a more comfortable level than boiled.</p>

<p>They are watching <em>Meet The Parents</em> in the other room.
It's a movie that I don't really like so I'm not watching.</p>

<p><em>Zoolander</em> is a far superior Ben Stiller movie.  Heck,
<em>Mystery Men</em> is better.</p>

<p>Dude just came in here with me to play on computers.  I guess he
doesn't really like it either.  Nope, he doesn't.</p>
