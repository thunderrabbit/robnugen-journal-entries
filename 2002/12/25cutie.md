<p>Oh my gosh what a cutie at this gas station.  Red hair and
<em>braces</em>.  Oh so cute!</p>

<p>My god.  It's been an hour and I'm still fixating on that cute
woman.  I should have said something, <em>anything</em> to her.  Well
I did, but didn't give her my card.  I coulda asked her how to get to
the freeway or said I'm on a roadtrip, or fucking anything.  Yargh.
Why was I so scared to do that?</p>

<p>Okay.  I seem to have kinda sorta thought of some reasons to get
over it.  The best two are (!) trust the universe.  (@) there's lots
of cute people that go by all the time in cars, but I don't know it
cause I can't see them.</p>

<p>Whatever.</p>

<p>I've now traveled 4045 miles since Dallas.  I'm at a Vista on 299,
some miles east of 101 in California (about 50 or so miles south of
Redwood Forest I'm guessing).  Time for sleeeep.</p>

<p>Haha 333 miles traveled today.</p>
