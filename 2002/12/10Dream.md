<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>On a road trip, I went back to Bloomington, staying in
a garage apartment at the same address as Maggie and Molly's house.  I
felt all sad like, "what am I doing here?" and was crying when I came
from the store where Barb was working, but when I opened the door,
some other traveler was in the room as well.</p>

<p class=dream>"When did you get here?"</p>

<p class=dream>"Not so long ago."  She had a guitar on the floor
beside her.</p>

<p class=dream>"I felt like I don't know what the hell I'm doing here,
that's why I was crying."</p>

<p class=dream>"Me too."</p>

<p class=dream>"Girl, give me a hug."</p>

<p class=dream>And we hugged, knowing the angst and trauma the other
may be experiencing.  So great to find a fellow traveler.</p>
