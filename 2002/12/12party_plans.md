<p>Woah.</p>

<p>I'm going to miss the party at RSA Inline, but Sally and I are
going to fly to San Francisco for a double-birthday-plus-homecoming
party tomorrow night!  (Jennifer and someone's birthdays are today or
tomorrow, plus Christine is returning from Costa Rica)</p>

<p>I've never done anything quite so... wild in my life.</p>

<p>$118 for round trip tickets, one day in advance.</p>

<p>Oh my god... I just realized that we'll be coming back on Sunday,
which is the day I planned to drive up to San Francisco.  How nutty is
life???</p>

<p>We'll go sailing on Sunday to see the seals.</p>
