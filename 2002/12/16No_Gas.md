<p>This is bizarre.</p>

<p>Second gas station that I've visited where I can't get gas.  Okay,
actually the first one just had signs saying "this product not
available" over both the low and mid grade gasoline.  They had the
high priced one available and I chose not to get it.</p>

<p>This second station has CAUTION ribbon around their entire gas pump
area.</p>

<p>Gasoline conspiracy?</p>

<p>Okay I got gas at the third place, which looked perfectly normal,
except for one thing.  No Reese's Pieces!!!!</p>

<p>Neither were there Reese's Pieces at Ralph's went I went shopping!
What kinda of state is this where I can't get Reese's Pieces?</p>

<p>They got Reese's Cups, but no Reese's Pieces.  To punish them, I
purchase no candy at all.</p>
