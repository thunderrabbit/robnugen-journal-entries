<p class=date>6:01pm PST Thursday 26 December 2002</p>

<p>Just climbed (drove up) a mountain about 90 miles north of LA.  I
wonder how high it is.  Getting gas now.</p>

<p>(actually I just need to pee and am getting gas to be nice.)</p>

<p class=date>6:07pm</p>

<p>Awww man.  No restrooms working at that gas station, so I came
across the street and *these* are out too!  "What's up with the
restrooms?"  "Water main is out; it broke yesterday from freezing."</p>

<p>D'oh!</p>

<p>And this cat wants 79 cents for Reese's Pieces, too.  Mannnnn.</p>

<p>4144 feet.</p>

<p class=date>6:42pm</p>

<p>4686 miles traveled.  <em>now</em> I'm in the LA traffic jam. and
it's 36 miles to LA according to the sign.</p>

<p class=date>7:06pm</p>

<p>Fuck that noise.  I turned around to take the exit that some signs
encouraged due to the traffic.  I'm on 126 now and will basically take
the 1 to Newport Beach.</p>

<p>4695 miles traveled.</p>

<p class=date>7:32pm</p>

<p>Ahhhhhh.</p>

<p>Working restroom in the Chevron in Fillmore, California, corner of
126 and 23.  *And* Reese's Pieces for 70 cents each, *including tax*.</p>

<p>Dat's what I'm talkin' about.</p>

<p>4714 miles traveled.</p>

<p class=date>8:34pm</p>

<p>Super twisty mc twisting up around this big mountainy area with
practically no reflectors (definitely no street lights) and beautiful
houses overlooking beautiful overlooks.  Gotta be a movie star
neighborhood here.</p>

<p>Ohhh and one is for sale.  Can't see the house, but I see the sign:
310-589-2461 Barbara Horton selling a property on 23 south.</p>

<p>Amazing houses on 23.  4749 miles traveled.  Curves everywhere very
little traffic.  Beautiful starry sky.  </p>

<p class=date>8:40pm</p>

<p>Another property.  This one at address 4100 south 23.  310-990-2079
Matt Ogden.</p>

<p>Buy one of these properties and tell the realator to give me a
finder's fee, and with the fee I'll throw you a house warming
party!</p>
