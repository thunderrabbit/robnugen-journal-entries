<p class=date>1:09pm PST Wednesday 25 December 2002</p>

<p>Well, I'm leaving later than I had originally planned, but it's
cool since my schedule is so loose.</p>

<p>I wonder if I'll be able to charge my computer easily along the way
home; I don't have any scheduled stops at people's homes where I can
just plug in.</p>

<p>We've been playing Animal Crossing.  My character now owes Tom Nook
148,000 bells.  Actually 146,000 since I paid him 2 G's.</p>

<p>Silly addicting game!</p>

<p>Rolling out sooonishly.  After I get packed.</p>
