<p>I interpreted the meaning to be "drums of life."</p>

<p><em>Such</em> precision.</p>

<p><em>Amazingly</em> loud.</p>

<p><em>Incredible</em> energy.</p>

<p>I danced so thoroughly, so hugely, that I was so tired when they
finished and some other recorded music came on with a great beat.
The great beat was on the calibre of Front 242's "Headhunter," a song
that gets me dancing every time.</p>

<p>Except this time.  "Headhunter" paled compared to these beats, both
in frequency, intensity, and awesomeness.</p>

<p>Plus I was flat tired.</p>

<p>After a bit, though, more dancing to more drumming.</p>

<p>Shaking the floor with two legged jumping to the beat, so loud that
I could be heard/felt over the drums and people watched.</p>

<p>When the drums came into the middle of the room, I moved over to
where they had been performing in a little alcove thing and danced
alone in their space.</p>

<p>Two different girls smiled at me as I danced.</p>

<p>At the end, talking to Xavier (who was at The King King Club on
Tuesday) and Sydney (who is from Brazil, but enjoys living in US more
now because he feels safer.  Also has quite an apparently positive
outlook on life.)</p>

<p>Ed, a friend of Sally's, after we had walked out into the street
was all, "and you sir.. we are glad you came out, but try to show a
little more enthusiasm!</p>
