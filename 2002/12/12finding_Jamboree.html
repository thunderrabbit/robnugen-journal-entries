<p>Once across the ferry I saw a sign welcoming me to Balboa Island.
"What?  Am I on an island <em>now</em>?  I'm trying to get back!"</p>

<p>Behind me was water and I could see boats a couple blocks in front
of me.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw a sign pointing toward Pacific Hwy, or Highway 1, or
the 1.  Perfect.  Over a bridge, through some small cramped houses on
small streets in beautiful dusky weather.  Got to a highway looking
thing and couldn't see if it.. ah, there it's Bay Avenue.  I'm looking
for Pacific Highway so I can get to Jamboree.. PCH must be up this
hill.</p>

<p>The name of the street up the hill?  Jamboree.</p>

<p>Wow!  I didn't know I had come this far back yet.  I was expecting
a couple miles at least.  A woman started up the hill on bike at the
same time as me, and she made it to the top by walking her bike, by
the time I had reached the top and waited for the cycle of lights to
come around again.</p>

<p>Left turn for Jamboree.  Good enough.  I got across half of Hwy 1 well
before they made it across to my side turning left.  Zooomed down the
hill and was dying on the way up, then zoomed down the next hill and
turned left across 4 lanes of traffic behind me as I had the left turn
light green and I zipped through it with one foot down ready to catch
me if my tires slip.</p>

<p>No slippage.  Perfect.  Speedy.  Awesome.</p>
