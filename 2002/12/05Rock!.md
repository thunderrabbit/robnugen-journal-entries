<p class=date>11:39am PST Thursday 5 December 2002</p>

<p>I'm chillin' out in the waiting area before my personal interview.
Brian *just* came out and told me and Frank, "your interviews will be
fairly quick; in both of your cases, the only reason you were not
accepted was for some circumstance regarding your situation."</p>

<p>YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Woot woot!!!!</p>

<p class=date>1:35pm</p>

<p>Back at Sally's now.  Ecstatic.  Elated.</p>

<p>Lost my parking ticket, paid $14 to get out of the lot.  Exuberant.
108 miles round trip.  Thrilled.</p>

<p>Enormous.</p>
