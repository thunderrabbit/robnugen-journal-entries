<p>Leaving Dude & Veronica's now.  I just scoped out my intended path
back; I'm not going to go through the 7000+ foot mountains to visit
Lake Tahoe and Reno and such.  Scott's feet are not treaded well
enough for all of that.</p>

<p>So I'm basically going to go down the 5 to LA and turn east on I-40.</p>

<p>Might go by Four Corners.  Might not.  Have to get to that area and
see what my schedule is like.</p>

<p>3710.2 miles on this trip so far.  I'm basically at the
north-west-most point of my adventure.  Certainly my mileage will be
less than twice this amount since my path back will be slightly more
direct.</p>

<p>152211 miles on Scott.  Roll out.</p>

<p>(thanks, Ludacris)</p>

<p>3710.8 miles on my trip so far.  I'm back at Dude's.  I forgot my bike.</p>

<p>3827.2 miles traveled.</p>

<p>Just drove backwards on the shoulder to get a picture: "Entering
Josephine County" for Josephine.</p>

<p>3885 miles traveled.  I've taken a little detour to see the Redwood
Forest.  It's going to be quite dark when I'm there, apparently, and I
don't really want to spend the night there so soon in my trek.  But
we'll see once I get there how it goes.</p>

<p class=date>7:18pm</p>

<p>Wow.  The Redwoods are big.  I've gotta come back here during the
day sometime.</p>

<p>This time my Redwood Forest tour was like, "wow, there's big trunk.
Ooh, that trunk is really big.  Woah, look at that trunk!"</p>

<p>3934 miles traveled.</p>
