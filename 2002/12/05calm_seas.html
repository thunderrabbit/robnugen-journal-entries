<p>The night sail didn't happen cause there was no wind.  But I hung
out with Michael, Elizabeth, Jeff who were there to sail.</p>

<p>We shared some funny culture stories ranging from wasabi ice cream
(bryn) to Japanese toilets (research to see from where the water
squirts and get a shot in the face) to saleditos (sp!) (spanish
salt-encrusted plums ("that's rather salty")) to the languages spoken
in Germany (no one speaks true German, only localized dialects)</p>

<p>Saw a well decorated boat go by.  Lights arrranged like an inverted
cone up front made a Christmas tree, and then two palm trees of lights
in the back and three levels of icicle lights hanging around the
entire boat.  Pretty neat.  I took a mental picture of it.</p>

<p>Heard some interesting popping sound over by the interface between
the dock and stairs leading down to the dock.  Michael theorized it
was the open lid of the supply box rubbing against the steps, but I
imagine he (like me) thought it was a bit loud for that.</p>

<p>Turns out that as tide was coming in, the open lid was getting
compressed under the stairs as the dock was being raised by the water.
Jeff popped the lid out from under the stairs and the dock/stairs
jumped three inches toward one another (measurable by how far down the
lid would have to go to get back under the stairs).  Wow!!</p>
