<p>I figured it out!  I know what is a big part of the fear that
wrenches me, rends me useless when I begin these treks alone out into
the world.</p>

<p>It's a fear that I'll be alone.  That I really am alone.  That I won't
be able to meet people every where I go..  That's the fear, or at
least a big part of it.  Such a silly silly fear!  Begone, silly fear!
Adios, payaso to you, buddy!  Whoohooo!!!!</p>

<p>I had this epiphany while driving and thinking of
other places to visit, and I got a flash of Mia Wallace in Pulp Fiction
who said something like, "I go to Amsterdam for a month every year
just to chill out." and the words "chill out" are what got me.  Would
I be able to 'chill out' in Amsterdam?  No.  What?  Why?  Because I
don't know anyone there.  AAHA!!!  Gotcha.  That's it!</p>

<p>No, I <em>don't</em> know anyone there <em>now</em>, but there are
bunches of cool people all over the world, ready to chill out and swap
stories and share beverages and just have a great time!
Whoooooo!!!!!</p>

<p>I just tried to call Janette to give her this answer to that
previously unanswerable question "what are you afraid of??" but she
wasn't home.  Or no answer at all; they may be on the phone.</p>
