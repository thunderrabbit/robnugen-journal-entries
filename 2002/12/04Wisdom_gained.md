<p>In the past I have predicted it; today I realize I am living it.</p>

<p>When I have far fewers things to do, things to focus on, I can take
better care of myself, and have more time to care for others.</p>

<p>The only thing I've had to work on the past couple days is get
ready for my interview tomorrow.</p>

<p>In two days, I have bought a new outfit, made some photocopies of
old recommendations, updated and printed my resume.</p>

<p>I note a few assumptions about this:</p>

<p>~) Inexpensive technology of computers, internet, photocopiers has
helped a lot.</p>

<p>!) Not having to work for food has helped a lot.</p>

<p>Number (!) may have great implications, all the way from having
resources available, to this whole society I'm living in, where I can
easily just wander in and out of Sally's apartment complex and her
apartment to chill and munch and do whatever I want.  Or that may all
just be a facade for the universe simply providing me with that which
I need to follow this life process.</p>

<p>@) There is a fine line; I could easily do too little and suddenly
feel my life brings nothing of value to the world, that I am useless.</p>

<p>#) I've had to give up a lot to have so few responsibilities.</p>

<p>$) Giving up a lot is exactly what has given me such freedom.</p>
