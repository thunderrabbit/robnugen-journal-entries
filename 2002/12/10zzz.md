<p>Got back from Santa Monica at 8pm, and Rick came over for grilled
burgers (Morning Star veggie burgers for me) and chillin'</p>

<p>Sally and I watched <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em>.  I
hadn't previously seen it.  My favorite scene is when the princess
reveals herself to be Invincible Sword Princess or something.
Nice.</p>
