<p>What a welcome sight to have Mikey pour smoothies for us when we
arrived back at the ranch.  Thanks to Hillary, Josepine, Mikey for
getting the smoothie fixin's!</p>

<p>Now everyone (except Paul, Jack (talking in Josephine's room),
Janette and I) else is at the store called Ole Moon, looking at stuff
including glass blown items, Hillary's current favorite.</p>
