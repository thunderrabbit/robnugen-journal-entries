<p class=date>9:13pm PST Saturday 21 December 2002</p>

<p>I've just arrived at a rest area, about 120 miles from Dude's.
(Eugene is 108 mile closer to SF than Portland, according to
Veronica.)  3576 miles on my trek. 152077 miles on Scott.  420 miles
so far today I think.</p>

<p>Been listening to mp3s via my cassette adapter and computer.  I'm
really happy with this setup.  22% battery left, so I'll conserve it
for a while, though I wonder if it could make it to Dude's...  Aw heck
nothing to lose if the computer goes to sleep due to no battery.  I'll
see if it makes it.</p>

<p>But, first things first.</p>
