<p>I had a million dreams last night, some of which featured Jason
Fricke, Maia Cudhea, Sean Murray, Erick Morrow, Bryan Beck.  Fun to
get back to old school YRUU.</p>

<p class=dream>I was in an auto parts store and Jason called me from
the beach somewhere on the auto parts store phone.  He tried to
pretend he was someone else, "hey my car is broken down because of
parts you sold me."</p>

<p class=dream>I could tell it was him.  "Yeah, well, y'all just get
your car workin' again, drive it on down here and we'll take a
look."</p>

<p class=dream>"You drive your store up here and bring me the right
parts."</p>

<p class=dream>"We're sending a helicopter now to come take a look.
Just sit tight."</p>

<p class=dream>"No, I dont want a helicopter. Send a train or a
tricked out school bus with 50 inch speakers kicking Frank Black and
Madonna duet of Marilyn Mason and 2 Pac songs."</p>

<p class=dream>"Okay; it's on its way."</p>
