<p>I've never seen a Woody Allen movie before.  I appreciate how he
strings scenes together, not hiding that they throw a lot onto the
cutting room floor, keeping the best for us.</p>

<p>Some of the scenes were just hilarious - Cookie, his best friend,
his son, all going to the honoring ceremony.. then his friend dying
without a sound.  Therapist bitching him out while she's got a patient
on the couch.  "You can't scare me like that!  I grind my teeth.."</p>
