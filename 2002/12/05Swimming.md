<p>Chilled (heated) in the hot tub; had to jump the fence because
apparently the pool key is different than the outer door key to her
building.  No one else in the hot tub, so after I took a nap, I ran
around its perimeter to make a whirlpool.  Fun stuff.</p>

<p>Took a big ol' fat nap and when the phone rang, I got up and walked
briskly into the mirrored door of her closet.  *BONK*</p>

<p>Hahaha</p>

<p>Sally was stuck at work but gave me directions to the night sail
tonight!</p>
