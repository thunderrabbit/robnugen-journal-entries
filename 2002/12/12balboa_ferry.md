<p class=date>4:49pm PST Thursday 12 December 2002</p>

<p>I'm on the ferry now, waiting a bit until we go to the other side.
I haven't had to pay yet, but it says bicycles are $0.65</p>

<p class=date>4:50pm</p>

<p>Now we are underway and I've paid.  One car, one bike, two
pedestrians, two operators floating across the bay now.  Three cars
and several people on the other ferry going the other direction.</p>

<p>Wow wow wow this is fun cause it's such a small operation.  The cat
just walked up to me with a wad of singles for change and a change
dispenser on his hip, "Sixty-five cents."  After we were already
underway.  I wonder if they would make me ride it back?</p>

<p class=date>4:53pm</p>

<p>We're across.  Bye!!</p>
