<p>380 miles from Portland (I don't know if I have more or fewer miles
to travel to Dude & Veronica's).  I don't really know where on the 5 I
am.  But I would like to note there's a mysterious white substance
piled up along the sides of the freeway.  Lumpy like a big pile of
powdered sugar.  Very interesting...  what ever could it be??</p>

<p>3418 miles traveled since Dallas.</p>
