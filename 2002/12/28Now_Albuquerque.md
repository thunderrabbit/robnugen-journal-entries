<p>Just turned over 5555 miles on this trip.</p>

<p>We're rolling toward Albuquerque now.  There's a great plume of
smoke ahead, which may just be water vapor from a power plant.  From
here it looks like a huge short broccoli with white stalk and dark
top.</p>

<p>Quite stange.  The top is definitely smoky or cloudy and the bottom
looks solid.  It's gotta be from a power plant.  Yes.  I'm sure that's
it.</p>

<p>5561 miles now.  250 or so to Albuquerque.  1 mile to Jackrabbit
Road.</p>

<p>Woah.  I crossed over into New Mexico and didn't even notice until
now, 24 miles into the state.  I'm quite awake; I've been spitting
Eminem's "Rabbit Run" pretty effectively.  I still can't figure out
some of the words, and those i just skip so I won't learn them
rhongly, but the rest i can pretty much rap at the same speed as
he.</p>
