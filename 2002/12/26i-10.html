<p>Muwahahahahahaaaa!!!</p>

<p>I have now seen where I-10 dumps into the ocean.  I had previously
only been on I-10 as far as Palm Springs.  (Not driving! but when I
flew to Con Con 1998, I also visited Jennifer in Palm Springs, and
part of the adventure included me driving on I-10)</p>

<p>They have an amusement park to celebrate I-10's arrival at the
Pacific!  Right here in Santa Monica.  Whoohooo!!!</p>

<p class=date>9:49pm</p>

<p>4789 miles traveled.</p>

<p>Got lost in Santa Monica, but too tired to totally enjoy it.</p>

<p class=date>10:08pm</p>

<p>Trying to get out of Santa Monica, following the 1 and
suddenly... <em>BANG!</em> without warning I end up at LAX!  Los
Angeles International Airport???  Woah!</p>

<p>I had no idea it was so close to Santa Monica.  I got a bit lost in
the airport area, but now after a glance at the map I think I'm set.
105 to 405 and I'll be back on a familiar freeway.</p>

<p class=date>10:54pm</p>

<p>After 70 - 80 mph LA driving on crowded 405 (I could get used to
this style of driving), I'm at Sally's aptartment complex.  If she's
not home, I'll go to Kinko's and upload all these entries.</p>

<p>4842 miles since Dallas.</p>

<p>Approximately 800 miles today.  (797)</p>
