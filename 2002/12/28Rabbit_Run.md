<p>Let's see if I can type the lyrics that I know:</p>

<p class=note>(screen off to save power)</p>

<pre>
some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surounded by a wall of bricks
every time I go to get up I just fall in pits
my life's like one great  big ball of shit
if I could just
put it all into all I spit
instead of always tryin' to swallow it
instead of starin' at this wall and shit
while I sit writer's block sick of al this shit
can't call it shit

all I know is I'm about to hit the wall
if I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits
this is it
last straw
that's all
that's it
I ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic

I'm like a skillet bubblin'
till it filters up
I about to kill it 
I can feel it buildin' up
a probably spilled enough
I concealed enough
my cup runneth over
I done filled it up

?????  explode fill my guts
you think I only stand here and feel my nuts
I'm gonna show you what
you gonna feel my rush
if you don't feel it
it must be too real to touch
feel the dutch (?????)

(something I forgot)

goose pimples
yeah
I'm gonna make your hair stand up
??? stand up
I'm gonna show you who I be
I'ma make you hate me cause you ain't me

you wait
it ain't too late
to finally see
what you closed minded fucks
are too blind to see
whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
out this world
ain't no one out their mind as me

need peace of mind?
here's a piece of mine
all I need's a line
but some times
I don't always find the words to rhyme
to express how I'm really feelin' 
at the time
yeah sometimes sometime sometimes
just sometimes
it's always me
how dark can these hallways be?
the clock strikes midnight
one two then half past three
this half assed rhyme
with this half ass piece of paper

I'm desperate at my desk, if I could just
get the rest
of this shit off my chest again
stuck in this slump 
can't think of nothin'
fuck I'm stuck
oh wait, here comes somethin'

nope 's'not good enough
scribble it out
new pad
crinkle it up
throw the shit out

I'm fizzilin now
thought I figured it out
the balls in my court
but I'm scared to dribble it out

I'm afraid,
but why am I afraid?
why am I a slave to this trade?

???? spit to the grave

[i forgot]

I can rip it any style you want

I'm a switch hitter bitch
Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'ma sit here until I get enough in me to finally hit a
fuckin' boilin' point
put some oil in your joints
flip the coin bitch
come get destroyed

an MC's worst dream
I make them tense
they hate me
see me and shake like a chain link fence
by the looks of them
you would swear that Jaws was comin'
by the scresms of them
you would swear I'm sawin' someone
by the way they're runnin' 
you would think the law was comin'
it's now or never
and tonight it's all or nothin'

Mamma Jimmy keeps leavin' on us
he said he'd be back
he pinky promised
I don't think he honest

I'll be back baby
I just gotta beat this clock
fuck this clock
I'ma make them eat this watch
don't believe me watch
I'm gonna win this race
then I'll come back
and rub my shit in your face
bitch
I found my nitch
you gonna hear my voice
till you're sick of it
you ain't gonna have a choice
if I gotta scream till I have half a lung
if I have half a chance I'ma grab it
rabbit
run
</pre>
