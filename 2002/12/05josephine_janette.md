<p>Was going to email Josephine to tell her congratulations for going
to advisor trainer training tomorrow, but realized my email wouldn't
get to her even if I go to Kinko's (unless I use yahoo) so I just
decided to call her and tell her, instead of going to Kinko's.  So I
did.  It was great.</p>

<p>Talked to Janette and told her my interview was great, and
congratulations on her new computer, and about my future plans and
such.  I was standing outside on the balcony cause my phone doesn't
work inside very well.</p>
