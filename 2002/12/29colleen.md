<p>When I first was chillin' with Colleen in the kitchen, I was all,
"look a raccoon!" and pointed to the kitchen floor.  So funny that she
looked, not that anyone wouldn't have looked, but because she has
several raccoon stories from her semester(s) at school in Corpus
Christi, from raccoons in the stairway to raccoons trying to come
steal her food, to raccoons coming to scrounge through the trash while
she's chillin' outside, to almost running over a raccoon in the
parking lot, to raccoons taking her car for a joyride around the
city.</p>

<p>Oh, wait, not that last one, but still.</p>

<p>"And the raccoons are freakin' huge like they sleep in radiation
fields and get all huge and stuff."</p>
