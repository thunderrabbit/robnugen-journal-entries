<p>Colleen, Janette and I went to see 8 Mile today.  It was Colleen's
first viewing, Janette's second, my third.  I loved it loved it loved
it as much as the first time, or maybe more.</p>

<p>Colleen wasn't as blown away as I appeared to be, as I busted out
of the theater, "that movie <em>crushes</em> all other movies!" and
decided once and for all I'm going to write to Eminem and thank him
for all his creativity.</p>
