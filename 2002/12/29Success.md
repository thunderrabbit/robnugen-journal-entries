<p class=date>5:35pm CST Sunday 29 December 2002</p>

<p>At a rest area now about 135 miles from Fort Worth on 287.  I just
called Josephine and Janette and chatted with them a bit; Josephine
told me a funny Skyler story and said she's heard of a new joke, the
Pink Car joke, which is a new one for us; Janette and I are going to
try and see Eight Mile again, and Two Towers together.</p>

<p>Got disconnected, though I could hear her wishing me well, then I
turned on "Rabbit Run" and ripped through it pretty effectively.
Rock.</p>

<p>Woo.  For some parts of "Rabbit Run" I can articlate the words
faster than he does in the album version.</p>

<p>iTunes music now.  About 104 miles from Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Zooomin.</p>

<p>Home.  6499.8 miles traveled.  155000 (exactly) miles on Scott.</p>

<p>House looks beautiful with green christmas lights on the bushes,
matching the green lights inside on the tree, and the green porch
light that's always been there..</p>
