<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Wende and one of her girl friends and I and two youth
were at SWUUSI.  We had our own cabin, away from all of the other
youth at SWUUSI.  I hadn't been to the past couple of events, so I was
unsure of everyone's name and kinda embarassed about that.  Unsure of
myself to go meet everyone cause I didn't know who I was supposed to
know and who I didn't.</p>

<p class=dream>I saw a square DVD on the coffee table so I tossed that
into the DVD player (looked like an old MAC Classic) and began to play
the video of some beach thing that had been held in Houston.</p>

<p class=dream>The light from the windows behind the TV were making it
really hard to see the TV so I used the remote control to close the
blinds on the windows.  Still too bright.  I closed the blinds the
other direction to see if that would effectively shift the light's
intrusion to the other end of the blinds.  No.</p>

<p class=dream>I started the movie and it was all touting the benefits
of sending your youth to YRUU; that YRUU benefits all who attend.</p>

<p>I woke up and realized that the light from the real sun was shining
in my eyes during my sleep.</p>
