<p>Sally and I totally went sailing today; it was so much fun!  It was
in a Lido, about a 12 foot boat with two sails.  I got to drive the
jib sail (small one in front) and then once we got out to the turning
basin she invited me to drive the tiller, and then the main sail.</p>

<p>I was pretty nervous at first, but to some degree found it second
nature, I think.  There were some points where I didn't know what to
do, but I got better after some practice.</p>

<p>In addition to sometimes having no wind, we found that part of the
difficulty was that the downward pointing board (centerboard) was not
pointing all the way down.  "That's why we kept sliding sideways!"</p>

<p>Kinda cold near the end, but I survived.</p>

<p>Tacking is interesting; I think I've got the hang of it mostly.</p>

<p>We got back just in time before the sky went pretty dark due to the
sun having already set some minutes previously.</p>

<p>Great great fun!</p>
