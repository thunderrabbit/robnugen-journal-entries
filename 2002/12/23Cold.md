<p>It's cold outside, and I'm pretty much letting that keep me
inside.  Been reading LJs and doing maintenance on my computer and
website.  Considering actually building some other parts to my
website, like a FAQ and ABOUT and stuff.</p>

<p>Gonna go soak in the hot tub, if it's actually hot (or pretty darn
warm)</p>
