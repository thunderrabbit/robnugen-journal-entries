<p>Well, I've driven almost an hour; I wonder how close I am to the
rest area.  I'm too tired to care; I'm parked in the parking lot of a
topless club that is deserted.  No tops, no customers, no nothing
except a bunch of 18 wheelers parked nearby to sleep.  I'm out of
their way I hope.</p>

<p>5868 miles since Dallas.  About 600 miles driven today.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
