<p>I'm at Veronica's clinic now to get bloodwork done, a euphemism for
STD testing.  This has been so much fun!  I have met a woman named
Bryn (!) (actually her name is spelled Brynne, but hey it sounds the
same) *and* I got two new decorations for my computer, two ink stamps:
one saying</p>

<pre>
Medicare Waiver
 Not Required
</pre>

<p>and the other is a smiley face.  I saw the first stamp on the desk,
stamped it on the cover of my computer and looked for some tape to
seal it from smearing.  No tape found... but then Stephanie walked in
with a roll of big clear tape!  Perfect!</p>

<p>When she saw how pleasing I found the new decoration, she was all,
"we've got more stamps," and offered up the smiley face and more
tape.  Beautiful.</p>
