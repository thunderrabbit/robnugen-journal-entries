<p>Christmas Eve has been pretty lazy, with me and Veronica playing
Animal Crossing, and Veronica and Pablo cooking an amazing dinner
while Dude and I sponged on the couch watching Tech TV (featuring the
beautiful Megan (who is now pregnant) and Morgan as the hosts for a
day with the regular hosts gone (on vacation?)) and Dude playing
Civilization.</p>

<p>I vaguely sorta kinda worked on a new perl project I'm working on
for Wende so she can store passwords securely on my website (and once
it's working I may allow others to do the same thing), hopefully
solving the problem of having to remember too many username and
passwords for a variety of websites strewn about the internet.</p>
