<p>See, this Kinko's is like all other Kinko's (except one!)</p>

<p>Free access and it's great.</p>

MST for a while and still using PST; this will slightly balance it
out, by skipping MST altogether.</p>

<p>Gosh it's late.  I must be tired!</p>

<p>Dammm.  I just looked over the "Rabbit Run" lyrics.. that's a lot!
I continue to be impressed with Eminem's skillz.</p>
