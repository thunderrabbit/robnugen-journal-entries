<p class=date>9:43am PST Tuesday 3 December 2002</p>

<p>At this moment, I'm wearing undies, shorts, and my red Trix Are For
Kids! t-shirt that Jennifer gave to me some time ago.</p>

<p>("I'm glad the shirt talks to you," she said.)</p>

<p>In a few hours, I will be wearing undies, black shiny shoes, dark
socks, undershirt, button up shirt, tie, suitpants, suitcoat.</p>

<p>I'm off to Fashion Island.</p>

<p class=date>11:44am</p>

<p>oops.  hang on one sec.</p>

<p class=date>11:56am</p>

<p>Well, I lost the claim ticket for my suit, but the guy smiled "it's
done by last name," so I'm not worried about it.  I trust no one will
find the ticket and be all, "hello, my name is Mr Nugen; I believe you
have a suit for me," cause my first name is on there too.</p>

<p>Anyway, I rolled into the parking lot playing Eminem with
my windows down and system up, strolled into Nordstrom beat boxing and
wearing the above mentioned outfit plus sandals.  Walked up to some
cat in the men's department, "I don't know if I'm out of my league or
not, but I've got about $500 and need to get a suit, tie, shirt,
shoes."</p>

<p>"We can do it for about that," he said.</p>

<p>Excellent.</p>

<p>In the end, I got suit/tie/shirt for like $600 and shoes/shoe trees
for $400.  Very exciting.  if spending a G on clothes is exciting.</p>

<p>Suit is being adjusted so I can pick it up tonight or tomorrow
morning.</p>

<p>Cool cat named George who helped me get the shoes.  I just layed it
out for him: I don't know what's fashionable, but I'm going to teach
English in Japan, blah blah, so he knew what to get me.  He's got an
uncle in Tucson, and we talked a bit about what it might be like in
Japan, etc.</p>

<p>I gave him my adventure card cause he was cool.</p>
