<p class=date>10:13pm PST Monday 9 December 2002</p>

<p>Went swimming.  Started in the hot tub cause the pool would
certainly be too freezing.</p>

<p>"Too hot for the hottub!  yeow!!"</p>

<p>Once we got too hot for the hot tub, we visited the pool, which
felt surprisingly not too hot.  Sat on the rope and held on with my
toes as Sally tried to shake it to knock me off.  Too tight for the
tight rope!</p>

<p>Saw a U shaped piece of plant hopefully, that when I pulled it out
of the pool, looked a lot like a rat tail.  Totally gross, but hey
chlorine should keep us safe, right?</p>

<p>Got cold after a while and went back to the hot tub.</p>

<p>After the other people left the hot tub, we made a whirlpool out of
it.  Fun.</p>

<p>Freestyled a song about "snot's not a loogey," which was quite
funny and quite good, if one likes songs about snot and loogeys.</p>

<p>Back up to Sally's apartment, cleaned up, ate, watched
<em>Deconstructing Harry</em>.</p>
