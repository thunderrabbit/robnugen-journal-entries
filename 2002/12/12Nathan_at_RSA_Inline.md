<p>Bang!</p>

<p>RSA Inline on 1644 Superior Avenue.  Nathan <em>gave</em> me a new
top flower shape thing for my helmet!!  Whoooo!!!</p>

<p>Telling him all cool stuff about my travels and stuff.  Cool cat.</p>

<p>He used to live on Kauai (Hawaii!!) for five years going to school
there.  Says it was boring - everything closes at 7 and only one movie
theater.</p>

<p>He's heard of Ed Veiseh.  Woah.  He knows a cat named Rachard
Johnson, professional skater.  Three different people from Kauai have
showed up living in this area and he's just found them again
randomly.</p>

<p>Nathan gave me a Strychnyne sticker to add to me helmet.  I tried
to give him a dollar tip for being so awesome and he gave me a
Powerade for it.</p>

<p>Showed me behind the shop they've got a skate park with a bunch of
four foot tall 10 year olds sailing around the ramps doing sick tricks
but wearing bike helmets instead of skate helmets.  Dunno what's up
with that, but hey.</p>

<p>Um, oh, they're hosting a skate competition and then a set of bands
is playing from 8 until ? on this Saturday night, so I may go to that
after sailing with Stefan and Cathy and Christie (if he gets unsick by
then)</p>
