<p>I'm in Arizona now. 5137 miles traveled.  Speed limit is now 75
instead of 70.  Oh the difference a state can make.  Scott and i still
prefer to go not much past 70 for long periods of time, unless we
happen to enjoy a gravity assist up to 80, as we did some miles ago.
Good stuff.</p>

<p>I bet myself a dollar that the state line was coming up soon, for
on the other side of the freeway (west bound traffic) there was
something that looked a lot like a toll plaza, except people were just
being waved through, just like I experienced while coming into
California on Interstate 8.</p>

<p>few minutes later when we crossed the Colorado River, I started
singing myself a song:</p>

<pre>
You owe me a dollar!
You owe me a dollar,
You owe me a dollar!
Pay it up now!
</pre>

<p class=date>7:36pm</p>

<p>Rest area now, about 18 miles into AZ.  5158 miles since Dallas.
I'm feeling pretty awake.  Yay chocolate and caffeine!</p>

<p>Oh, and I just now did kinda sorta well on maybe 1/2 of "Rabbit
Run."  I've got the first section memorized, and can usually keep up
with him on it.  Up through "My cup runneth over / I done filled it
up"</p>

<p class=date>7:49pm</p>

<p>On the road again.  A cat had posted two handwritten copies of
anote in the restroom, explaining that his car had broken down and
that he needed $61 to buy parts.  I was moved to give him a dollar "in
the white Plymouth Acclaim," but each time i saw him, I was unmoved to
do so.  Maybe it was cause he sat in the passenger's seat, eating
soething.  I duno; it just didn't feel right when I saw him.</p>

<p>What did feel right, however, was climbing in the rafters of the
roof over the brick structure covering th picnic tables.  It was
basically a plus sign of brick walls about 8 feet tall and then a roof
over them, and a table in each quadrant formed by the walls.  I stood
on a table, no wait, I put my foot on a table to stretch, and then I
saw the rafter and that I could easily reach them by standing on the
table.  Pulled myself up, climbed over the wall, and lowered myself
onto the table on the other side.</p>

<p>Good stuff.f</p>

<p class=date>8:50pm</p>

<p>five thousand feet and rising..</p>

I didn't see an elevation sign at the peak, but it wasn't much higher
than the five 000 one.  maybe 5100 feet. Now down down down we go.
