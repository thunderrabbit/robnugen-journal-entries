<p>On the way home, we drove by the spillway from White Rock Lake into
a river that goes underneath Garland Road.  That's where Sean and I
bicycled all those months ago and saw it as a tiny trickle of water
over the wall in the middle where the wall is a bit lower.</p>

<p>Today the entire wall had about 6 inches of water gushing over it,
rushing quietly down this slight slope and then crashing loudly over a
couple of rocks and into the river proper, turning one big island into
lots of little islands and then gushing under the foot bridge and road
and away into the night.  I'd like to see it during the day.  Oh, with
my camera too.  I wonder if it will still be as much water pouring
over it in the morning, and if I'll even remember or be willing to go
over there.</p>
