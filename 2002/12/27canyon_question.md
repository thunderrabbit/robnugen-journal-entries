<p>So.  I'm at an exit that claims the Grand Canyon is 60 miles north.
Flagstaff (my goal for the evening is 30 miles east.  I will flip a
coin three times to see which way I go.</p>

<p>Heads equals north, tails equals east.</p>

<p>In either case, I will drive to the goal, and not stop short.</p>

<p>All this coin flipping entertainment *after* I get gas.  Oh, and
there's <em>snow</em> on the ground around this Shell station!</p>
