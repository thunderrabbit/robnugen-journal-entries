<p>After fabulous dinner of crepes around spinach and italian bread,
we opened presents.  I got nothing for anyone, not even for the dogs
Bailey and Remington, but everyone got me something.  I feel thankful
and indebted.  I realize now that I haven't even replied to my mom
when she asked me some days ago where I would be for Christmas.  I
didn't know for sure at the time she wrote, and as the answer became
apparent, I still didn't write to a parent.</p>

<p>Anyway, Dude got me a conservative tie as a gag gift (no pun
intended) and I said I'll use it in Japan.  They also got me a $20
gift card from SAM'S so I can change my oil at some SAM'S on the way
back, *and* a roadside assistance case (tools, battery terminal
cleaner, ponchos, light, blanket, *plus* a 24 hour free roadside
assistance up to three times in the next year from date of purchase).
Holy cow wow!!</p>

<p>I think we're going to jump into the hot tub in the cold outside.</p>
