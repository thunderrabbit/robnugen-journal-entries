Chinese Immigrants; University of California Irvine) and have just
called Nova and arranged an interview with them <em>IN 3 DAYS</em>
here in LA!!  Holy shit that is awesome!</p>

<p>Gotta get a suit; I got nothin' but shorts and T-shirts and jeans
this part of my trek.  Whoooooo!</p>

<p>My interview is from 9am - 2pm Thursday 5 December.  Rock.</p>

<p>I need to update my resume and copy my existing letters of
reference/recommendation that I have already in case they don't still
have them.  Easy.  And get a suit.  Easy given money; I may be able to
borrow one.</p>
