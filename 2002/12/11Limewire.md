<br>Hi Rob -<br>
How are you doing??? Remember me???  I have a friend that is thinking about moving to Houston and I could not give him an honest opinion. How do you describe Houston after living in New York all your life.  But the move would be a good move for him finacially.  Is it ok if he can email you if he has any questions.<br>
Thanks and Happy Holidays.<br>
Brandie
