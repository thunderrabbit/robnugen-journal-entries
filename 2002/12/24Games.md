<p>Been playing <em>Animal Crossing</em> on a Nintendo Gamecube.  It's
for little kids, but pretty fun and somewhat addicting.  It's like a
simplified non-aggressive non-violent version of Civilization or some
such.  Although there is fishing in this game, which could be seen as
aggressive or violent toward fish.</p>

<p>The computer driven characters in the game "keep doing stuff" even
if the human players don't play, thereby simulating that time has
passed in the game, making human players not want to miss anything and
play more more more!</p>

<p>Veronica is playing now.  Her character's name is Cutie.  Mine is
named Bunny.  Pablo's is named Morcheba.</p>

<p>We have one free house in the town if you'd like to join.</p>

<p>Veronica hadn't played since October, so she owed the town
banker/store owner interest on what she owed him previously.  She now
owes him like 10 times the amount that I owe him, which is presumably
how much she used to owe him.  (this is basically to purchase a house
in the town.)</p>

<p>Pablo says that if one plays long enough, the townsfolk will build
a statue of the player in the middle of town.  Wow.</p>
