<p class=date>6:48am PST Tuesday 17 December 2002</p>

<p>Dawn coming up around me.  Windows foggy a lot on the inside.
Going back to check out the area I saw last night.</p>

<p class=date>7:20am</p>

<p>Definitely higher tide than last night.</p>

<p>I took a couple pics and two .MOVies of the waves.  Maybe they'll
come out enough to slightly get across how incredible are these waves.</p>

<p>Leaving El Capitan now.  2761 miles driven since Dallas.  151262
miles on Scott.</p>
