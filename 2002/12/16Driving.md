<p class=date>3:49pm PST Monday 16 December 2002</p>

<p>2637 miles traveled since Dallas.</p>

<p>I've been on the road for a while and I'm right now passing a sign
for El Segundo, with the Tribe Called Quest song going through my
head.</p>

<p>I forgot to look at mileage exactly as I left Kinko's but oh well.</p>

<p>I'm a bit tired, but there's not many free rest areas to sleep,
plus I want to go more than 1 hour before stopping.</p>

<p>Oh, and it's rain rain raining.  Slow LA traffic allows me to type,
and use my computer to play the aforementioned song through my
cassette tape adapter and headphone port on computer.</p>

<p class=date>6:27pm</p>

<p>2713 miles traveled.  Spent a lot of time in LA traffic.</p>

<p>It's dark.  I have <em>just</em> exited the 101 to the 1 ("the"
instead of "highway" or "interstate" as is the local custom) and find
it almost deserted compared to what I had been on.  Parked on the side
to record the moment.  And check the map.  And pee.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Ooops.  I exited way earlier than I thought I had.  I'll still
scope out this beach and then go back to the 101.</p>
