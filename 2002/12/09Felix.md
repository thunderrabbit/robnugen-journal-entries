<p>Ate at Felix's in Orange, California with Sally.  Sat outside side
by side under a heater thing, facing the traffic circle, the interior
of which featured a decorated christmas tree, palm trees, magnolia
tree, and tall pine trees.</p>

<p>We laughed a lot.</p>

<p>A woman in a Subaru pulled up, waited around a bit, got some coffee
at Diedrich's then left.  Sally said that my next car would be a
Subaru cause it's so practical and is four wheel drive.</p>

<p>I was like, "actually, I'm going to get a gas/electric hybrid."</p>

<p>Around that time a white truck drove around the circle with its
system bumping.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I wanna get a system like that for Scott."</p>

<p>"You can.."</p>

<p>"Naw man, I'm not going to drop a thousand dollars on that.."</p>

<p>"You can at least just get an upgrade for a couple hundred."</p>

<p>Interesting point.  "I'll get a system in my hybrid car.  Ita be
all bumping around the street, jumping from lane to lane cause the
bass is so big.  I'll get me some twenty fo, no make it thirty six
inch speakers.  Can you imagine.." I held my hands out at three foot
diameter, "speakers this big.  Hafta be made out of wood, or
metal... piece of glass, or plastic.  sumpin like that."</p>

<p>One of the waitstaff came up to us and asked in espanol, "did you
just win the lottery?"</p>

<p>I didn't understand him and could only pick out lottery and was
all, "lottery?"</p>

<p>Sally understood, said no we didn't.</p>

<p>"oh you are just in love..."</p>
