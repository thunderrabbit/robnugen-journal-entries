<p class=note>(dreams)</p>

<p class=dream>Wende and I were at SWUUSI and I saw Bryn and her mom.
Grabbed Wende by the hand and ran up to Bryn.  "HI!" but she was
rather non-responsive.  So I told her I got her a guitar pin from Hard
Rock Cafe, and she didn't seem to want it.</p>

<p class=dream>Saw some cats doing tricks on skateboards, jumping over
curbs and chain guardrails and such.  I decided I could do it and went
up to the top of the hill.</p>

<p class=dream>I got scared at first, and then recoginized it was a
dream.</p>

<p class=lucid>"This is a dream, just do a 360 over the chain."
Rolled down the hill and lept when I came near the curb, did a 360
counterclockwise over the curb and chain and landed with glee on the
other side.</p>

<p class=dream>Then we were inside a rather large, glass walled
elevator car, sitting along the sides of it, and the sliding elevator
doors didn't lead out of the elevator, but just to the elevator's own
entry way, which was in itself another elevator.</p>
