<p>YES!!!</p>

<p>Thanks to Marcel's suggestion, buried in a tome of wit, I figured
out how to <a
href="https://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20020708094743450">change
the port that OS X mail app uses to send mail</a> because Kinko's has
blocked port 25.</p>

<p>I also therefore had to see how to tell robnugen.com to <a href="https://www.sendmail.org/~gshapiro/8.10.Training/DaemonPortOptions.html">use another
port to listen to email</a>.</p>

<p>Searched for DaemonPortOptions in the sendmail.cf and found that an
alternate port had already been set up!!  Whoooo!</p>

<p>Now why didn't tech support at webquarry tell me about the
alternate port when I told them I was having problems???</p>

<p>Ah well; I don't care; I'm happy to be back in emailland again!</p>
