<p class=date>3:16pm PST Sunday 8 December 2002</p>

<p>Been working on Kim's website.  Aggrevated at it now because the
shit isn't working the way I think it should.  Been fucking around
with it too long now for my own happiness; going back to Sally's to
see if she is awake yet.</p>

<p class=date>2:29am PST Monday 9 December 2002</p>

<p>She was awake.  We went to do some errands - mostly returning or
exchanging stuff she had purchased from Office Depot, Ikea, and
Robinson something.</p>

<p>Then we went to a dinner party hosted by her friend Michael.</p>
