<p>Lots of grape vineyards on either side of the 101 now.  Smooth
immaculate green grassy hills otherwise.  Overcast with occassional
drizzles.</p>

<p>Previously I gawked at large oak trees dripping with moss coating a
hill in mottled grays and greens.  A rainbow began to arc from behind
them, not quite finding enough moisture to climb over the hill.
Cattle on terraced slopes eating lazily.</p>

<p>40 miles to San Luis Obispo, which is where the 101 and the 1
separate for a while.  I'll take the 1 along the coast.  Somewhere
along there is Piedras Blancas, which apparently features elephant
seals fighting to mate.</p>

<p>On the 1 just north of San Luis Obispo, and saw a sign for
California Mens Colony.  I wonder what that is?  Anything like my
men's group?</p>
