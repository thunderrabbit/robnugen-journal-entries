<p>Catherine called me tonight!!  I told her how I've been randomly
being yogastic in my posture (though I'm not right now) and that I
sometimes just stand in Tadasana for fun and meditation.  Awesome.</p>

<p>She said she has something to email me..  I've not heard from her
in *months* (nor she from me, so hey); I wonder what it is.</p>
