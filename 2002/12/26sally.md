<p class=date>2:01am PST Friday 27 December 2002</p>

<p>Sally was home!  A good clue was her living room light on.</p>

<p>We chatted; I showered; she showed me pictures from her Houston
trip (she just got back today); we watched the last story in
<em>Amores Perros</em>.</p>

<p>Now it's bedtime and couchtime for Sally and I, respectively.</p>
