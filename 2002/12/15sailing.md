<p class=date>6:17pm PST Sunday 15 December 2002</p>

<p>Went sailing on a 30 foot Shields (sloop rigged keel boat) with
Sally and Jasmine today.</p>

<p>Jasmine's voice <em>and</em> laugh are *amazingly* like Danielle
Bartley from UH!  So incredible how similar they are.</p>

<p>Jasmine was the official skipper of our voyage to the seals and
back, but we all shared time at the tiller.</p>

<p>The seals were awake this time, and not bathed in sunlight until 5
minutes after we left their area.  I got several pics and two mpegs of
them.</p>

<p>Got pretty cold on the way back, and I had to pee pretty much a
lot.  We got back before the sun set, and before I had to go
overboard.</p>

<br>It would be "at the tiller" not "at the keel" (the keel is the big thing at the bottom of the boat) [fixed.  Thanks!]<br>

Here are pictures of different kinds of keelboats, shields are at the bottom of this page:<br>
