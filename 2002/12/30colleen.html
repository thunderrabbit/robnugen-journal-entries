<p>So great to have a chance to sit and chat with Colleen.  Wiggidy
wiggidy wack stuff had been going on in her life, but my blessing
intention is that she has gained all the wisdom and insight she is
supposed to have from these experiences and that it's all an uphill
spiral from here.</p>

<p>I've so enjoyed being able to watch her grow for 7 years, (and she
said the same thing about me!) for basically all her adult life (and
mine too, eh?).</p>

<p>I hope hope hope I have helped at least in some small way.</p>
