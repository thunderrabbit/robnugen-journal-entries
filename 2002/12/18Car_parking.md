<p class=date>7:27am PST Wednesday 18 December 2002</p>

<p>At 7am Wende was all, "Bun, are you awake?"</p>

<p>I hadn't been, but I wake up quickly usually. "Yeah."</p>

<p>"We have to go move your car."</p>

<p>She had been up until 4am talking to Ty.  Got up and loaded two
boxes in the car that she wants to take to Good Will.</p>

<p>I was impressed at not killing the engine going from 0 to up this
steep-ass hill.  Curbing the wheels helped by keeping Scott in place
while I found the right combination of gas and clutch.  Awesome!</p>

<p>Missed the second turn due to traffic, but made a few illegal turns
after that to get around the block and back to the parking garage.</p>

<p>"I don't think I'll get a standard if I live in San Francisco."</p>

<p>It's like a valet garage cause there are elevators for the cars and
such.  The guy was all, "Woah" when he saw Scott was a standard.</p>

<p>Back to sleeep.</p>
