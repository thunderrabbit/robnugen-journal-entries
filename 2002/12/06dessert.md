<p class=date>5:01am PST Saturday 7 December 2002</p>

<p>Sally showed me where she used to live in Huntington Beach,
basically midway between Newport Beach (her current digs) and LA.  We
had two cups of hot chocolate</p>

<pre>
("Would you like some more?"
"Yeah, gimme three.")
</pre>

<p>each, and split a pile of apple pancakes with banana and peanuts
and whipped cream.  Quite yummy.</p>

<p>Saw a house shaped like a medeival castle overlooking the beach,
and saw where the real Navy Sals train and such.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Saw fantastic waves coming to meet the shore along the asphalt path
that winds along the beach for hours...</p>
