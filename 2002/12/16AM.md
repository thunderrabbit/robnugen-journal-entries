<p class=date>9:07am PST Monday 16 December 2002</p>

<p>I'm leaving Sally's today.  Going to San Francisco to see Wende.</p>

<p class=date>9:57am</p>

<p>Hugs to Sally as she leaves for work; I'll see her again soon.</p>

<p>Tears in the kitchen after she's gone.</p>

<p>It seems that I'm learning how to "leave" some place after having
been settled there.  Basically just get all my shit and leave.  Not
needing permission from the undefinable, which I've felt I needed in
the past.  Good to learn and grow.</p>

<p class=date>11:33am</p>

<p>Finished grocery shopping.  Restocked her kitchen a bit and got her
some new toothpaste.  Got the correct kind, all the way down to the
choice between "fresh mint" and "fresh mint gel"</p>

<p>To get the grocery discounts, I signed up for a Ralph's card and
put my city down as Marfa, Texas.  Made up a 77315 zip code.</p>

<p>Time to pack and get the flock outta here.</p>

<p class=date>1:18pm</p>

<p>Packed.  Loaded.  Bags, bike, skates, suit, everything.</p>
