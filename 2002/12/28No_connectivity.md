<p class=date>2:38pm PST Saturday 28 December 2002</p>

<p>So I plugged in my computer at Kinko's, like I do at every Kinko's
and this cat comes up to me (after a couple minutes of connectivity,
enough time to upload all my entries before this one) and he's all,
"are you connected to our network?"</p>

<p>"yeah."</p>

<p>blabber blabber some bullshit about how I'm not allowed to connect
because if I bring a virus into the system it will corrupt all their
machines or something totally wiggidy wack like that and I'm all, WTF?
What a fucked up policy, EXPECIALLY considering the DHCP-enabled CAT 5
cable is on the desk of the cubical just like all other Kinko's I've
ever visited and he's telling me I can't use it???</p>

<p>I can't believe how pissed I am over this, and part of it is that
I'm pissed at myself for actually disconnecting even though I know
it's a fucked up policy made up by some non-computer-genius cat who's
scared of the internet.</p>

<p>Argh.</p>

<p>All I wanna do is send the five emails that I wrote and are waiting
in the inbox to go.  I'll do that and then roll out.  I can't engage
this guy in conversation; I'm too mad about it all.</p>
