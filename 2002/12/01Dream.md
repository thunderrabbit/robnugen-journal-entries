<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Driving up a mountain, Sally and I were helping to hold
the highway together, like reinforcing it with big metal plates,
attaching them to rocks and such to make sure that nothing would fall
apart, so that the freeway below would not collapse under its own
weight and slide down or break off the mountain.</p>
