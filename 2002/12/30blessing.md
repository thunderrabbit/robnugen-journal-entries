<p>What an incredible blessing to inspire Ken to drive out to Davis
Mountains!  He inquired about the terrain out there and I told him a
bit then showed him pictures I had taken.  He was all, "Ann, look,"
and seemed determined that this trip they must take.  No people, lots
of stars, lots of rocks to climb... totally beautiful.</p>

<p>I was *pumped* to feel like my adventure actually helped someone
else be inspired to travel!  By me taking care of myself, I have
helped the world.  What an amazing feeling.</p>

<p>He blessed my life, the choices I've made.. said I'm "making all
the right choices" and living in reality instead of trying to follow
the non-spiritually-fulfilling American Dream that is so crammed down
our intellects by media and culture.</p>

<p>Thank you, Ken.  Thank you, angels.  Thank you, universe.</p>
