<p class=date>12:33pm PST Monday 9 December 2002</p>

<p>Sally and I bicycled around the main big loop of Peter's Canyon.
Up and down big hills with 10mph speed limit signs at the top,
indicating the max speed one should allow on the way down.</p>

<p>I didn't make it up one of the hills without getting off my bike,
but I was able to restart and almost make it all the way up.</p>

<p>Sally saw a fox.  I didn't see it.</p>

<p>A bit tired after going around once.  I could go around again,
but I would be pretty darn tired, plus we haven't eaten yet today.</p>
