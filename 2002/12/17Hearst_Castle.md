<p>Saw a sign for Hearst Castle.  I wonder if it's the castle that the
guy built out of coral and that I saw on TV many years ago?</p>

<p>Hearst Castle, upon first glance, looks nothing like a Castle.  But
I'm going in anyway.</p>

<p>Oh, this is the visitor's center.</p>

<p>Boring.  (sour grapes)</p>

<p>Or so I presume.  I talked to one of the cats in the visitor center
who said the tours just take a bus up to this castle and let people
look at different rooms.  Blah.  Bunch of warning signs "Tour 1
requires climbing over 150 steps, no refunds after boarding the bus")
blech.</p>

<p>And only $8.75 for a hot dog and drink at the fast food restaurant
thing.  Gag.</p>
