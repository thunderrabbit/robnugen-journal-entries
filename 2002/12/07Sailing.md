<p class=date>SO MUCH FUN!!!</p>

<p>We went on a shields (30 foot sailing vessel) oh my god so awesome!!!!</p>

<p>Stefan (sp), Kathy (sp), Christy (sp) and I all had a great time!</p>

<p>Briefly:</p>

<p>Seals!!  All boneless flopped all around on top of the bell buoy,
heads hanging all over the place soooooo cute oh my god if I had a
camera I would *DEFINITELY* get their pic on my site.</p>

<p>Stefan sailed three times around the seals so we could just watch
them over and over be so cute, and start barking after the third time
we went around.</p>

<p>M&Ms..  Peanut butter.  mmmmmm.</p>

<p>Dancing (me, Stefan, Kathy) on the front deck while Christy paddled.</p>

<p>Standing out front on the deck hanging kinda over the side, holding
onto the mast stabilizing wire and the jib line.</p>

<p>Cloudless, perfect fucking fantastic weather!!!!!</p>
