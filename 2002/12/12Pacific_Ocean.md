<p>So right now I am sitting on the beach in Balboa Island area.  I
don't see an island, but Fashion Island sure isn't an island either.</p>

<p>Bike is chillin' behind me, sun is low in front of me, bathing
surfers in warmth as they frolick about these waves on (and off)
surfboards.</p>

<p>So beautiful.  I'm glad Sally encouraged me to visit this beach.</p>
