<p class=date>1:27pm PST Sunday 8 December 2002</p>

<p>Woke up this morning, cleared my bedding off the couch, got shelves
out of Sally's car; she wants to put them up today.  She's still
sleepin', though, so I'm at Kinko's working on Kim's website until I
get bored or until she emails me asking for help (which I
offered).</p>
