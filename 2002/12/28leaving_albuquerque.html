<p>Aight.  I'm as done online as I'm going to be tonight.  There is a
rest area one hour away from here; I hope it's open; a couple rest
areas in NM along I-40 have been closed.</p>

<p>In any case, I'm going to drive east more until I get to the rest
area or some other spot that looks good for sleeping.</p>

<p>Ah; I found my next Kinko's in Amarillo.  It's near a street called
Mockingbird.  Close!  But wrong city.</p>
