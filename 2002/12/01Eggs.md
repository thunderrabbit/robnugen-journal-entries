<p>Sally's out of eggs cause her houseguest from last week cooked all
12 of them in two big omelets, so I went to the market on site but
they don't have any.</p>

<p>"You ain't got no eggs?" I effectively asked the guy behind the
counter.  They do but they're all in the back.</p>

<p>"How many do you want?"</p>

<p>"Just a dozen." (*)</p>

<p>"They come singly."</p>

<p>"Um, how about five?"</p>

<p>"How about six?"</p>

<p>"Okay, six."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Walking out, I thought of two classes of funny answers to the
original question.</p>

<p>"Um, about a pound." or "Five and a half."</p>
