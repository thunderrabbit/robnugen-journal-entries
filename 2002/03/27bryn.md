Brynsies!

So great that you got your flight; thanks for letting me know. :-)

I hear ya about being super busy; I have been AS well, and after two days of
not a lot of work, I'm about to get movin and groovin to get some stuff done
around here.  I have mostly gotten my sleep back inline with this timezone.
Lee-eh was so funny last night, she said I have to "reset my brain watch"
and I was all, "????" and then "oh!  internal clock!!"   So funny!


I have done a bit of research on Japan, and found a testimonial site that
gives some presumably good sound info on what it takes to "make it" there as
a teacher.  Step 1 is bring $5000, or at least to be prepared to spend 5 Gs
to get set up.  Lee-eh confirmed that last night when I talked to her about
it, so I'm leaning more toward accepting her offer of accomodations with her
fam when I arrive!

Thank you for taking the time to write.  It makes me feel loved, and I
smiled bigly to be greeted with this email today.  :-)

I love you!!

	- Rob!

oh!!  Thanks for the birthday wishes!  I didn't celebrate, but a few people
called me even so.  Maggie called to wish me a happy 11668th day (I think)
Heehee!  she's so great.   I'm looking forward to my 12000th day on 31
January 2003!!!  Whoohooooo!!

Rob,

sorry I haven't written or called, life has beAn
pretty hectic for me the last couple days and I am
only taking a short break from writing to send you an
email (i haven't even written Vessy since i've beAn
home!)

i caught my flight and made it home safely.  i have
only beAn offered $4000 a year at Richmond when is
hardly enough, so i am trying to persuade them into
giving me more, but for now i am still planning on
making it my new home.

i got my pictures developed, some are good, some are
bad, but they are all fun!  i will try to bring the
best ones to plano so you can see them too!

have you caught up on your sleep yet?  i haven't had
much time to, but i will, i'm sure!  how was your
birthday?  i hope it was great!  i wanted to call you
but i didn't get home til late last night and i didn't
have a chance :(!  but know that i was thinking about
you all day!

i am going to definitely be at plano if only for the
sake of presenting the yac restructuring resolution.
hopefully YAC will support us, but anyways, i will see
you there!

thank you so much for going with me to Europe, i had
such a great time, and every experience was so
amazing!  What an awesome adventure!  I still haven't
heard from Graham, but i assume he got our note and is
still breathing?!

anyways, i need to get back to writing but thanks
again, so much!

i love you heaps!

you are a great great friend to me and you will always
be in my life!

smiles and love,
me
