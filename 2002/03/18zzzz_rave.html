<p>I went to a rave last night, where a girl smiled big at me while we
were dancing and then subsequently approached me, put her arms on my
shoulders and said, "I want to cuddle" and then something, and I was
all, "I'll dance with you, but that's it."  She asked if I was drunk
(not like, Oh my gosh you don't want to cuddle; you must be drunk) and
then asked if I knew anyone that could help her get something.  (As I
type this, "ABC" by The Jackson Five is being fed through the speakers
at this internet cafe.  Same one I was at yesterday, but this time I
purchased a 24 hour pass for £4.  Now it's "(I can't get no)
satisfaction" by whoever sings that.)  I was all, "um, no, but good
luck."  Then she's all, "are you from around here?"  I told her no and
it turns out she's from Chicago.  She backed off and then when she left
she gave me a cheek to cheek kiss and "nice to meet you."  "You too."
