<p>I injured my ankle (tore a ligament) two days ago
(on my first full day) and went to the ER.  2 X-rays
and 2 crutches, and 2 days later, I'm much better.
I'm taking the crutches back to the hospital
today.</p>

Fence</a> on which I place my Magic Rob briefcase
presented to me with love from YAC and especially the
Bibby's at Plano rally in 2001.</p>
