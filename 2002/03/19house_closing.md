HI Wen

Thank you so so so so much for your work and for
closing on the house without me there.  I shall write
you a postcard today.

I *might* even call you, but that's not particularly
likely.

I love you tons and have had a great time.  I've
learned some about myself, and I see why this travel
thing is necessary in my life.  (necessary = critical)
but I'm not sure if I can explain it all yet.

I've had great trouble getting money, but I know how
to do it now.  No one will accept the AE banking card.
 But I can put cash on my MC; I hope it's not going to
cost a whole lot.  I think I've found a way to put
money on it with no charge at all.  (except for the
money.)

Huge hugs and huge love to you, my dear friend.

You are the best best best.  :-)!

Oh; I went to a rave last night and it was pretty good
considering it was a Monday night, when people should
be getting ready for school or work!  I was
propositioned for sex, asked for drugs, and asked if I
was from Denmark.  No way, got none, false.

Everyone here has a cell phone, and their ringers are
extremely cooler than ours.  Bronwyn even has a
hologram for the face of her phone.  Maybe we can get
those too, but I've just not seen them.  

I have pics of Big Ben, Westminster Abbey (I think),
The London Eye, Salvador Dali statue, all with KTRU
sticker prominently in the frame.  Funny.  :-)

I'm having trouble hanging up with you.  Maybe that's
why I shouldn't call.  Maybe that's why I should. :-)

     With Love
      - Rob!
