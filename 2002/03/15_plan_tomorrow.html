<p>We are planning our day for tomorrow; our first full day in London.  London Dungeon, Tower of London, London Eye, Big Ben, Hyde Park</p>

<p>Matt is talking about a big ass gold statue that  we can see at Hyde park</p>

<p>Bryn and I have decided one of the cultural differences is that these guys are more active in their hanging out, including table tennis, guitar,  random wrestling, and a just more relaxed atmosphere.  I'm not convinced that it's an entire cutlure moreso than just the sub-groups that we are used to.  It's quiteresting thought.</p>

<p>I need to send my pics to Tanja</p>

<p>The table is close to the exit door of the loo, so people have to knock before the come out of the loo.  funny.</p>

<p>by this time the house had mostly fallen toslep; I had been sleeping on the couch for an hour or so.  Two mattresses were extracted from a storage shed or some such and added to the decor downstairs.  This is a cool old three story house with maybe six bedrooms on the second and third leels and just living room dining room, and kitchen downstairs.  Bryn and Tanja slept upstairs on the third level on Graham's single bed.  Graham slept on a mattress down on the first floor.</p>
