<p>I'm chillin' outside my apartment complex now.  I've officially left work and I think they'll be pretty able to cope without me no problem.  I wrote a prett long explanitory email of te status of the projects I've been working o.  Cool.  I just called Wende to see why she's late, but she reminded me that we had agreed upon 3:30pm, not 3.</p>

<p>I'm just so thrilled about this trip that I'm ready early!</p>

<p class=date>4:40pm</p>

<p>I'm at the gate at the airport.  Traffic was no problem at all, and during our trip I systematically tried to guess the 3 digit code of the lock we used for our luggage in Australia.  I got the code after 100+ attempts.  372.</p>

<p>No problem getting through the security.  This time I didn't freak whe I sa the guns.  Butt I did smile to myself as I thought, 'how'd you get <em>that</em> in here???'</p>

<p>It's faster for me to put my Visor and keyboard in my bags becuse I don't have to shw it to anyone and don't have to unpack and repack my pockets.</p>

<p>I'm at Gate 11, at the far end of the International terminal.  Buut I'm healthy and strong and I ca walk it no problem.  I enjoyed the moving sidewalks, not just for their movement, but for the memories of David ad I oing to Ohio and playing on thtem, plus my long Koosh Joke, which I told to David and Amy and Hethre on the way to Austin Rally.</p>

<p>Interesting to begin the European immersion.  I see a lot of European facial structures, and hear some accents.  Fun.</p>

<p>I shoulda brought water.  I'm slightly hungry; I'll go get a snack.</p>

<p>I've now had an orange/pineapple muffin and orange juice for $4.78, twice the price I'd pay outside.  Wow.</p>

<p>Should see Bryn in about one hour.</p>

<p>This is my third international flight as an adult:</p>

<p><ol><li>Costa Rica in Nov 1997</li>
<li>OZ in February 2001</li>
<li>UK and France in 2002</li>
<li><em>Japan 2003</em></li>
</ol></p>

<p>I wonder if we will need to show our passport to use the Chunel from UK to France. I doubt it, but I hope we do so I can get one more stamp in my passport.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that I'm anxious to get stamps in my passport.  I wonder if I'll be as excited in 5 years.</p>
