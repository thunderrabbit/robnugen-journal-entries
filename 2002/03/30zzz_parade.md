<p>Have just arrived back home after going to see <em>Parade</em>, starring
Katharine and Catherine, friends of Kristen.</p>

<p>I feel quite tired and don't know if I'll get it all down.</p>

<p>The movie (*) is not about a parade, although there's a reference to a
parade in the show.  It's the story of Leo Frank, who was accused of raping
a 13 year old girl in his factory.  He seemed to be pardoned by the governer
of Georgia, but then a mob killed him, according to the book.</p>

<p>What impresed me most was the freezes that the entire cast had to do on
occassion.  Just to stand so still for so long is too much for me.</p>

<p>Fuck I'm falling asleep as I write.</p>

<p>The show as much heavier plot and subject than I expected.</p>

<p>I was impressed with how many actors and actresses I recognized from
previous shows.</p>

<p>After the show Kristen, Jessica and I met Catherine at Biba's and were
soon joined by Katharine.  Lots of laughter and funniness, but Katharine
left a big early with sore gut region.  We laughed for so long about so
much, until we were gasping for air between funny sound effect making when
someone pointed to someone else.</p>

<p>had to be there.  So funny!</p>

<p>(*) Due to being so tired, I wrote movie instead of play or musical.
<br>(**) Due to being so tired, I quoted a Lyle Lovett song I think.</p>
