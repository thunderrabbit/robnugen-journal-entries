<p>Bryn and I have been sleeping for a bit, like a small puppy pile at a rally.</p>

<p>Thing is, the seats are tilted back, but the arm rests don't go as far back.  So one thing that is relatively comfortable puts the pillow against the raised arm rest.</p>

<p>It's apparently 7am London time now.  I'm going to sleep a bit more; we have a bit under 3 hours of flight time left.</p>

<p>breakfast now on the plane.  There is snow outside on the ground.</p>

<p>We waited for quite a while but never saw her.  Finally decided to go upstairs to look and found her immediately.  Now we are at Garfunkel's Bar and Restaurant to eat fish and chips.</p>
