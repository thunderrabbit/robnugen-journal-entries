<p>We have just taken the train to Monument station and used the public access terminal for internet.  I wrote a nice message to peeps at work and I lost it due to not being used to the keyboard.  And there's no CTRL key so I couldn't do CTRL-Z to get it back.  Doh!</p>

<p>The keys are stainless steel hardened for abuse and fairly tought to press.  harder to press than a telephone key.  but much thinner.</p>

<p>They ahve single keys to type 'www.' and '.co.uk' and '.com' and ':-) and ':-('   Pretty funny.</p>

<p>Okay we're going.</p>
