Last week Kim Sawyer invited me to write what I would have wanted with my
family members after they die if they died now.

Fred (brother) - to actually have talked to him about important stuff more -
relationships, spirituality, life plans and goals, how much I love him, etc.
To be able to hug him bigly when we see each other and when we part ways.
To hang out with him a bit more often.  As a joke to have surprisingly
dropped in on one of his classes at UT.

Ma (mom) - to have felt like she understands me and my motivations. To
explain that I don't want all the crap presents I get at Christmas each
year.  For her to listen to my stories and be interested and not confused
about what/why I do things.  For her to understand New Warrior.  For her to
quit asking me about dad and just call him up if she wants to know.

Dad (dad) - to have hung out a bit more often.  To be able to hang up the
phone precisely with him.  ("precisely" means not having to say, "well,
okay, I'll talk to you later, okay, have a nice day, okay thanks for
calling...okay, bye!")  Just say "bye" and be done with it.

Karen (Dad's fiance) - to not think she's trapping my dad in marriage.  To
not hate how she controls her daughter who is in college!  To respect her as
a person.  I judge that she is controlling my dad as well - stuff like
decorating the house -> moving all her shit in -> remodeling the
kitchen/dining area....

Jon (Ma's husband) - to get to some deeper level stories of his.  To
communicate with him a bit more.
