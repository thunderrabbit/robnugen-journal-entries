Subject: actual question

HI

If I put something on the fence and the owner decides
to remove it before you take a picture, will you
accept a digital photo that I've taken of it?

Thanks so much!

ps: I'm in London from US (Houston) on holiday and
will be adding a lovely old briefcase that says "MAGIC
ROB" on it.  Maybe tomorrow (Monday 18 March) or
Wednesday.

Thanks!   

- Rob
