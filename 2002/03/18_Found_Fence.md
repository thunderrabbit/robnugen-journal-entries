<p>this is my first of two days alone in the city.  I have found The Fence and took a picture of The Keys which have been featured on the site for a while.  Interesting to me:</p>

<ol><li>there is not actually a sign on the fence.  There are a few signs along a nearby fence, but not this one.</li>
<li>The keys haven't been cut off by the fence owner.</li></ol>

<p>I took a train from the fence to the hospital to return the crutches.  As I approached the hospital, I found that it was right next to the London Eye!  I hadn't seen it up close yet but (*), so I walked over to it, and got this fun picture of Big Ben clock tower and the Abbey (?) and my hat blew off during the picture taking, but I didn't stop to get it; the shot was obviously more important and I glanced at my hat which had just blown off my head to have a rest on the sidewalk, and was not running across the street.  I finished the shot and a young woman picked up my hat as she walked by and offered it to me with a smile, and I said, 'thanks, love' as they do it UK and it really sounded funny with  my US accent and not like 'thanks luv' but hey it's all good; I got the pic and my hat's still on, jack. (**)</p>

<p>So now I'm in a cafe just outside the Dalí exhibit, which is a great surprise because it was on my list of things to hopefully do (the exhibit, not the cafe) and I hadn't looked up its location yet, but it's right by the London Eye, across the river from Big Ben</p>

<p>(*) adding but to the end of a sentence is something I've begun to pick up from Bryn who got it in OZ.</p>

<p>(**) 'hat's still on, jack' as a reference to Bill Cosby's description of his cowboy hero, Buck Jones.</p>

<p>I just overheard that the London Eye costs 10 quid (***).  I'm not doing that without my brother or dude or Jason or someone who will enjoy it with me.</p>

(***)  Quid = pound like dollar = buck
