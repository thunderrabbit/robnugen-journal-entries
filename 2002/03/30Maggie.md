<p class=date>10:54 am Saturday 30-3-02</p>

<p>I'm at Maggie's house now, Maggie-sitting her while she packs.  She's
telling stories about her reaction/breakup/arguments with John surrounding
their breakup.</p>

<p>I'm so thankful for my much cleaner breakup with Wende than Maggie and
John are experiencing.</p>

<p>Later this day I went to KTRU to drop off stuff for Abi, and then
um, oh that was the night I went to see Parade with Kristen.</p>
