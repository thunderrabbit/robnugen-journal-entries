<p>I'm at an internet cafe "easyEverything" which has
a realtime £/hour calculator to determine how much
time a single £ will purchase. It's according to the
number of users online in their store I believe. 
cool.</p>

<p>On this keyboard,</p>

<pre>
Shift 2 is "
Shift 3 is £
'@#~ are to the right of ;
</pre>

<p>I injured my ankle (tore a ligament) two days ago
(on my first full day) and went to the ER.  2 X-rays
and 2 crutches, and 2 days later, I'm much better. 
I'm taking the crutches back to the hospital
today.</p>

<p>But first, I plan to find <a

Fence</a> on which I place my Magic Rob briefcase
presented to me with love from YAC and especially the
Bibby's at Plano rally in 2001.</p>
