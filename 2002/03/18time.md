<p>timing is everything?</p>

<p>I got to ride on the trains a lot today.  I got to
the place where I can get a massage for £20 per hour,
but that was only in February; in March it's £30 per
hour, but it's only on Thursdays.</p>

<p>Doh.</p>

<p>I went to the American Express Bank, but I got
there at after they closed at 3:30pm ("half three"
they say)</p>

<p>And I have 7 minutes remaining on my easyEverything
login.  Fortunately, that's enough time to finish this
entry.</p>

<p>I was wrong about one thing though; my time is
decreasing faster as more people are on this system.
When I logged off the first time (earlier in the day)
I had 50 minutes remaining and £.52 on my card. When I
logged on now, I had only 18 minutes for £.52.  What's
up with that?  Hmph I say. Hmph.</p>

<p>I did get to see the Salvador Dali exhibit, which
was overwhelming to my senses. I've decided he was
mad.  Even though he says he wasn't.  Wow to that
art.</p>

<p>The name of this entry (time) is for Dali, who
often created art depicting the majesty of time over
humans.
