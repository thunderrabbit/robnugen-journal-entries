<p class=date>7:11 am Friday 29 March 2002</p>

<p>I have been taking time for myself in the mornings
- like 1.5 hours to get ready, including eating a good
breakfast (*), taking some chillout time to eat,
etc.</p>

<p>This is something I have not preiously done, like,
at all.  Maybe a few times, but nothing like making a
habit out of taking time for myself in the
morning.</p>

<p>For years I have 'known' I would benefit from this.
 I'm thankful that I'm doing it now.</p>

<p>Maggie called yesterday (I had left my phone at
home) and said she's decided not to move on Saturday,
but still invited me to come play with her in the
morning.  I'll call her today to plan our
adventure.</p>

<p>Um,... oh I get to check today to see how well <a

worked.  Hopefully I'm onto something great with
that.</p>

<p>there was one more thing....</p>

<p>Oh, tonight Kristen and I are going to find some
Texas postcards that I'll send to my new friends met
while in Europe.  :-)  hooray!</p>

<p>Tomorrow day I'll go to Dude's and work on
organizing pics from my trip, and tomorrow night
Kristen and I are going to see Catherine and Katharine
in a show at <a
href='https://www.masqueradetheatre.com'>Masquerade
Theatre</a>.</p>

<p>(*) bunch of vegetables and some protein like eggs
or fake tofu-meat</p>
