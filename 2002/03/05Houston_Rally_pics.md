<p>I have just put 24 megabytes of pictures from the <a
href='http://www.robnugen.com/cgi-local/images.cgi?dir=rallies/houston2002'>Houston
Rally</a> on my site.  That's a lot of pics.</p>

<p>I haven't optimized them, renamed them nor thumbnailed them.  No
promises on when that may or may not happen.</p>

<p>They are in chronological order, though, so that may help you sift
through them.</p>
