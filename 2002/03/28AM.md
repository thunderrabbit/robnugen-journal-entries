<p>I just spent a few minutes looking for the NO BEGGING image, and
now I'm going to continue my inspired work on the GSU technique for
getting this survey done.  Sometimes I wish I could show off the types
of things I'm building, but it's all proprietary and copyrighted and
all that kind of shit.</p>

<p class=date>8:32am</p>

<p>I just got pulled to creating another version of the branded survey
I made for the peeps in Singapore before my trip.</p>

<p class=date>9:45am</p>

<p>Okay that is finished, but I found a slight bug in the code.  I've
got to track that down and see what's the dealio.</p>

<p class=date>11:41am</p>

<p>Bug is found; bug is fixed.  I think actually my code was fine and
it's SAS that needs to be fixed, but whatever.  It works now.</p>
