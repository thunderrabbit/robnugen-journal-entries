<p>Bryn and I have just returned from The Fence, at which we attempted to place Magic Rob box, but were immediately approached by a woman who seemed rather cross, 'what are you doing?' 'I'm putting this box on the fence?' 'No we don't want anything on the fence; you must take it off,' as she was grabbing at the box.  Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>So we stepped away from the fence a bit, still with the box, and figured out what to do.  I wanted to at least for goodness sake's have a picture of the fence with my box.  I'm not coming all this way and not even get a picture of myself.</p>

<p>So without touching the fence, I stepped in front of it and asked Bryn to take a picture.  The woman and man stepped back out of their office.  I told them I'm not going to touch the fence; I'm just taking a picture of it.</p>

<p>She asked if I had anything better to do and why was I harassing the fence and I should go take a picture of some other fence.</p>

<p>'I've come to London just to see this fence, and would like to take a picture of it at least.'</p>

<p>Bryn took the picture, one serious, one happy, and then she gave me back the camera.  I was all, 'go back toward the pub; I'm going to take a picture of their office.'  The woman had the door open, glaring at me; I should have done a hip shot photo for when I put the camera up to my face, she shut the door abruptly and ignored me, talking to the man at his desk.</p>

<p>Back to the pub; this time I was careful to use the door not facing their office, for certainly glaring eyes were watching.  Around the corner and wondered again what to do.  I put the box beside the wall and stepped inside.  The fencemaster had another pint of Guiness on his table; I walked around to make sure it was him.</p>

<p>'How was it?' he inquired expectantly.</p>

<p>'We got kicked of pretty quickly.'</p>

<p>'Really?  Wow.'</p>

<p>'Yeah, she was pretty mad.  They said they would call the police and everything.'</p>

<p>'Oh this is <em>great</em>,' he emphasized.</p>

<p>He asked for the magic box and said, 'it's as good as on the fence, and I have a sneaking suspicion that this will be the next update on the website, and probably the last for a while.'</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>Bryn and I just finished our fish and chips; we're going now.</p>
