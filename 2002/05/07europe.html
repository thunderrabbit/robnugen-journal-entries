<p>It has recently come to my attention that I cannot find the
electronic journal entries that I wrote during me-an-Bryn's European
adventure.  I remember several times taking copious notes on my Visor,
but now I don't see them anywhere.  Not in my Visor, not on my Yahoo!
account, not on robnugen.com.</p>

<p>Apparently I won't be able to easily recreate a play by play, hour
by hour description down to the last tiny detail of the adventure.
I'm not entirely bummed about this, but just a little bit.  This gives
me an opportunity to reflect back on the trip as opposed to just
piling stuff onto my site.</p>
