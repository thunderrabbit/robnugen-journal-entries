<p>I'm at this dumb little site that I found cause it was featured on
www.nunames.nu: <a href="http://www.katy.nu">www.katy.nu</a> and it's got
two pages, a list of names of her friends, and a link to a joke page.</p>

<p>Some of the jokes are *funny*.</p>

<p>What did the digital clock say to his mom?</p>
