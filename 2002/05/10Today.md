<p class=date>5:25pm Friday 10 May 2002</p>

<p>Today we changed our T1 provider at work.  This has been a long
time in preparation, partially because we have clients that have
"trusted" our IP address so their users can visit us without using an
extra password, and partially because we have a cluster of machines
behind a NAT-enabled firewall acting together as our web server,
instead of just one machine with no firewall.</p>

<p>Right now I'm telnetted to my site, and have configured my settings
in pine to be more like what I want - don't ask before expunging
messages, don't ask before quitting; that kind of thing.  Oh, and use
emacs as my default editor.</p>

<p>That last one is a bit silly because usually I use emacs as my
default mailer anyway, which necessarily uses emacs as my default
email editor.</p>

<p>But anyway, pine is configured better now and it's allll good.</p>
