<p class=date>6:52 am Friday 17 May 2002</p>

<p>Wende, Anna, Molly, Will, Maggie, Kerry and I are at Le Peep celebrating
Maggie's first day (second or third day now) that they've been officially
divorced.</p>

<p>Our waiter just took all our orders without writing them down.</p>

<p class=date>8:02am</p>

<p>Fun time by all.  Some work stories, some college stories, some
relationship stories.  I'm at work now.</p>
