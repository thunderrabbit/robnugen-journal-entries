<p class=date>5:00 am Thursday 09 May 2002</p>

<p>I'm up early this morning after having slept yesterday afternoon.  I have
to be back at work in 2 hours for part two of the chat meeting with
Singapore.</p>

<p>It seems that I may be typing more on her speed as I've been using dvorak
layout at work.</p>

<p>I'm actually going to go in to work now and get some coding done
hopefully.  Working on a couple changes with the Email Sender - it is
blanking out a field after the emails are sent, and it's not working
correctly if there are no emails to be sent, but there is a report to be
generated.</p>

<p class=date>8:59am</p>

<p>For a couple hours I was able to maintain dvorak layout, but then we
started having communication breakdowns with two slow typists, and I
switched to qwerty to clear everything up.  I'll switch back soon.</p>

<p>I also handled a voice phone call at the same time as the chat.  It was a
bit of a challenge to handle both conversations at once.  Good stuff.</p>
