<p class=date>8:03 am Saturday 18 May 2002</p>

<p>I didn't set an alarm to wake up even though I got to bed at 3:15am.  I'm
thankful to my angels/self for waking me up on time.</p>

<p>This morning before ultimate, I intend to shower/shave, eat, get cash at
ATM, check work computers, stop by to say HI to YRUU.</p>

<p>After ultimate I need to give Jennifer at Paint This! her key back, DJ at
KTRU from 7 to 10pm.</p>
