<p class=date>11:30 pm Cinco de Mayo 2002</p>

<p>I just got home from Maggie's where we watched the deleted scenes
from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back on DVD.  Pretty funny, most of
them, but probably more funny if I knew more movie stuff than I do,
especially their movie stuff.  (obviously (?))</p>

<p>I re-felt the sense of, "wow, I wonder if I could write a movie and
be all famous and shit?" and when I think about it, I realize that's
not in my life path right now, but there's a part of me that
romanticizes the idea.</p>

<p>After Spider-Man, we met Eric and Meredith at Red Robin, at I-10 and
610.  Waiter's name was Supa Dupa Mike, who knocked off the price of
both teas after charging for two teas when there was only one.</p>

<p>I ordered Nachos Machos sin jalepeños, but it came with them anyway.
 He took them off at my reminder.</p>

<p>Drove by Eric and Meredith's house and Maggie reminded me we were
near her old old old old neighborhood from which I would pick her up
each day before school in 1992.  That's when we had a lot of classes
together.  How could I have forgotten about picking her up?  I had, but
remembered after she told me.</p>

<p>She dropped me off at her house (where I had left my car after YRUU)
and I zipped home.</p>
