<p>Just conversed with Emilio for 3 hours on the phone.  As usual, he asked
me a bunch of questions, probing my life and spiritual beliefs, which I
totally love.</p>

<p>To be clear, he got plenty of time to describe his current family
situation, and his current consideration that he may become a priest in the
Jesuit denomonation.</p>

<p>At one point during my long winded description of what I think is the
nature of this reality, I had a sense of being interviewed - and a wanting
that this was all being captured so I could be immortalized, er, I mean so
that more people could read/hear my thoughts and hopefully be helped by them
in some way.</p>

<p>Thank you, Emilio, for interviewing me.  It was a great pleasure.</p>
