<p class=date>10:11am CDT Thursday 26 September 2002</p>

<p>Okay, today I'm going to work on redesigning Kim's website and the
way the whole thing works, to make it easier for him to update content
on the site.</p>

<p class=date>11:54am</p>

<p>Hmmm.  Unless I'm missing something big, I think I've gotten the
basics of this site redesigned.  I will use regexp techniques that
Fred taught me when he wrote my new journal index thing.</p>

<p>I checked my email and Calder sent an urgent message yesterday
asking me to contact her.  From her livejournal, I think she may have
been kicked out of her house.  I emailed her back and gave her the
phone number where I'm staying.  I hope/trust that the number won't be
abused.</p>
