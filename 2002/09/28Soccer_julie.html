<p>We're at Julie's soccer game now.  Hannah and I have shared flag
duty.  Score is tied 3-3 now I think.  It's 4th quarter.  Actually
Hannah and Antonella are doing flag duty together.  Antonella has the
flag and is running behind Hannah who has been telling her which way
to point.  Antonella is about 5 or 6 it looks like.</p>
