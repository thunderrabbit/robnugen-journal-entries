<p>Kris and I just rode bikes around Norman, leaving a note for Debu
on her door written on a guitar string packet with a pen that was in
the unlocked truck on her driveway.  We took turns each writing one
word on the note, but pretty much our handwriting looks equally
sloppy; a normal person wouldn't notice that two people had written
it.</p>

<p>Saw his friends Chris and Barret and their dog Porter, then rolled
back to Kris'.  We'll probably go find Laura and get ice cream on her
board plan and then do whatever.</p>

<p>The Real Frank Roesler Experience just called me and gave me his
number for when I make it into OKC, which will probably be tonight or
tomorrow morning-ish.  I think tonight is more likely.</p>
