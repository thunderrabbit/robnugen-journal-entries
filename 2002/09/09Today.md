<p class=date>1:49pm CDT Monday 9 September 2002</p>

<p>Watching Simpsons: "bye bye house!"  "bye bye toothbrush." and "Put
food in me" "<em>I'll</em> take that."</p>

<p>"Ms Krabapple said that you would fold faster than superman on
laundry day."</p>

<p class=date>9:50pm</p>

<p>Mostly slept all day, but now we're at TWU library, and I found
that I can just connect my computer to any of their network cables.
In this case I've jacked a cable from a computer that wasn't powered
on.</p>

<p>Wow.  wonderful wild stuff.  Check out <a

and some of the navigation links at the top of the page will certainly
prove interesting.</p>

<p>I like the concept of SINGULARITY:</p>

<blockquote>"The postulated point or short period in our future when
 our self-guided evolutionary development accelerates enormously
 (powered by nanotechnology, neuroscience, AI, and perhaps uploading)
 so that nothing beyond that time can reliably be conceived." Anders
 Sandberg.</blockquote>

<p>I think what that describes is a time when we literally cannot
predict the future cause shit is changing so quickly.</p>
