<p>Just watched Chucky and two others test for their brown belt in
karate.  Pretty amazing stuff, and I might have gotten some good
pictures, but mly camera seems to be having a few problems.  I'm glad
I got the 3 year warranty on it.</p>

<p>I was pretty intimidated when I first came into the dojo, and a bit
nervous before and during parts of the testing.  Fun stuff.  I winced
a couple of times during the ippons, especially when Matt simulated
breaking his uke's neck.  Eeek.</p>

<p>"Uke means dummy" giggled Marta.</p>

<p>Now we're leaving Bennigan's.  I sat across from Brody (sp), the
main cat at the dojo.  By cat I mean second degree black belt.</p>

<p>I was really impressed with the test; tons of training is involved,
from memorizing Japanese names for moves, to studying the culture
behind the art, to learning how to kick someone's ass in a fight.</p>

<p>In one of the ippons, the bad guy started by grabbing Chucky's long
ponytail (it goes down to her butt) and she had his ass on the ground
so fast I don't even know what she did.  Amazing.</p>

<p>They had to fight against people wielding a (rubber) knife and a
wooden stick about 2.5 feet long.  In these cases, the weapon was
quickly removed and usually used against the attacker.  At the end of
one of the knife simulations, the bad guy stood back up and put the
back of his hand against his neck and flicked his fingers alternately
open and closed like the word "many" in ASL.  I was all, "??" and then
I realized he was simulating blood spurting from his jugular.
HHahahahaha!  eewwww.</p>
