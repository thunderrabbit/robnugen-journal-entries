<p>Happy happy with Kris and Laura in Laura's dorm after eating ice
cream at 31 Flavors.  What color is asparagus?  It's the 26th most
popular color according to Crayola's America's vote thing.</p>

<p>We walked up the stairs to the 12th floor to get to her dorm.  I
encouraged Laura to walk up them every day and she'll be in markedly
better shape at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Tiffany and Shawn just came over as we were watching <em>Clay
Pigeons</em> Kris' favorite movie.  It was weird; I'm glad they got
the bad guy in the end.</p>
