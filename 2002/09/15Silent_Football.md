<p>On the way home from church, Joey and I noted that Janette has
never played Silent Football, so we called Jackie who met us at
Bibby's so we could introduce the game to Janette!</p>

<p>Got home, Ellen called Joey to do French homework and was hijacked
to play as well.</p>

<p>Ellen zoomed in the fastest cutest way that cannot be described,
but it was so cute that she got negative 1/2 penance point.</p>

<p>Jackie said "he" a lot and then was declared (by Joey (who was
Dictatress at the time)) she can only use the pronoun "he" and not
even first person singulars.</p>

<p>I set up a two way wormhole which we used well for a while and then
Janette had to go P and while she was gone, I declared a wormhole
between Ellen and myself without telling Janette.</p>

<p>Then, even funnier than that: while Ellen was away, and Joey and I
were making faces at each other</p>

<p>Janette did the best little bunny foo foo dance that was SO Funny!
something like "Little Bunny Foo Foo hopping through the forest,
picking up the field mice and bopping them on the head, and the mouse
said 'ow!!'"
<br>"Little Doctor Foo Foo hopping through the hospital, picking up the
field mouse and stapling him on the head"</p>

<p>Janette in a Georgia accent to Joey as dictator "Madam Vagina
Sweet Potato..".</p>

<p>Then Janette tried to claim that everyone had been mispronouncing
her name though she didn't let us know until late in the game.  Then
she wondered if she could get penance points removed for having been
insulted for so long.</p>

<p>Eating pizza now (me, Janette, Joey, Jackie) as Janette and I relay
the story from yesterday.</p>
