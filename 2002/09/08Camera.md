<p>Chillin' at Best Buy, in line now to get my camera examine by the
tech guys so they can be all, "yup; it doesn't work" and then I cna
get a new camera.  :-)  I'm glad I got the four year guarantee on it
when I purchased it.  Good $60 well spent.</p>

<p>Pooh.  This ain't Walmart or Target where I can just get the shit
exchanged in two seconds.  They will send it far away and it should be
replaced/repaired by 28 September.  Pbbltt.  I shoulda taken it in
sooner.  Ah well.</p>

<p>I gave them Bibby's address for shipping.</p>

<p>Ah; I know why I was surprised.  When I brought my handspring visor
in, I was able to get it replaced immediately.</p>
