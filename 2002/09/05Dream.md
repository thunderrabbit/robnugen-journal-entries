<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>I was somewhere and Heather from back in my high school
days called and came to visit!  We hadn't been in touch for a long
time, lke a few years, so it was good to catch up, but we didn't
really talk about much.  When she first saw me, she said, 'you look
good; you look like Mr Reagh,' which was a total compliment  cause he
was one of our best teachers in the world. in high school.  As we were
talking some of my youth fom Northwoods, Susie Scully and Hethre were
being silly and purposely standing  or sitting almost in the way of
our conversaion.  It was funny.</p>

<p>I think it's time I email Heather.</p>
