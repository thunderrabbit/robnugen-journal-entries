<p>In Plano YRUU now.  The Sai Baba followers (I don't know what they
call themselves) are here each week.  A few weeks ago one of the
leader types gave me a stapled pack of literature, none of which I
have read since he gave it to me.</p>

<p>He inquired about it, and I was all, "um, I haven't read all of it,
but there's some very interesting stuff in there."  I guess there is.</p>

<p>Simon was talking about the girls in his debate class at school.
He thinks they're kinda cool and Marta was all, "but what about you
only liking YRUU girls?"</p>

<p>Simon goes "they're liberal so I can relate."</p>

<p>I go "and debate."</p>

<p>Simon: "what?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. sorry, mate."</p>

<p>"Don't do that!"</p>

<p>"too late."</p>

<p>hahahaha from the group.</p>

<p>me: "don't hate!"</p>

<p>Jackie just paid me the dollar for the naming rights to Jackie
Purdy's Game, which we will hopefully play after checkin.  I'll give
fifty cents to Wende.  heehee I can direct deposit it.</p>

<p>Jackie points out that "Kate" rhymes as well.</p>

<p>Kate's birthday is on Wednesday.  Jackie's is this Friday.</p>

<p>Leigh met a woman at the vet whose dog is named Dog, pronounced
"Dee-o-gee."</p>

<p class=date>6:53pm</p>

<p>At the risk of being un-youth empowering, I directed a conversation
about what YRUU means to each person, and then a short soap box on
what this incredible community can be to people if they choose to
accept the power.</p>

<p>Then I described how the YAC is designed the mouthpiece of the
youth group, allowing the church to understand what the youth
want.</p>

<p>Okay, now who wants to be on YAC???!!!</p>

<p>(no response)</p>

<p>que sera sera.</p>
