<p>Chillin' at DFW airport again, this time waiting to pick up Janette
who is returning from California via Denver on Frontier airlines.  I
had no idea there3 was an airline called Frontier, so when I read her
message I was all, "what's frontier?  and what airline is it?"</p>

<p>All is clear now.</p>

<p>Some cats were just interviewing a woman on camera; I dunno why.</p>

<p class=date>8:31pm</p>

<p>At Bibby's house now; Janette had a great trip.  None of the little
cats are here, but we're going to make spaghetti..  :-)</p>

  dear rock,

   so have you guys read jos entry about not always liking people that
   much. for some reason i found it really funny.maybe im just a
   bastard. but that entry inspired me to take what she said a litle
   further and say that i dont like any of you lousy garbagefaces. and
   you can all rot for all i caree. if any of you idiots every try to
   hug me ill spit in your eye. ok so maybe jo is a very sweetgirl
   trying to be honest and im a spiteful grouch but that doesnt change
   the fact that you are ugly. and smell bad. wanna fight?

   sincerely,
   face

<p>Hahahahhahaa!</p>
