<p>For some reason, I made the assumption that someone would wake me
up for closing circle.  Now I have learned that closing circle is
<em>over</em> and that people are at Denny's.  Fuck.  I would have
enjoyed saying bye to peeps who were not going to Denny's.</p>

<p>I was also surprised to see that my computer had been left out.  I
left it with Calder writing on it so I could go to sleep after the
Silent Football game collapsed into sleepfulness.</p>

<p>I am thankful that my computer remained safe.  And I'm thankful for
the notes from Calder, Ed, Richard, Ashley.</p>

<p>Going to Denny's now.</p>

<p>Denny's was fun, though it took a bit to find out which one they
were at.  Calder and I called different ones in Tulsa, and the one she
guessed was correct wouldn't answer the phone to confirm they had been
overrun by a horde of 60+ youth.</p>
