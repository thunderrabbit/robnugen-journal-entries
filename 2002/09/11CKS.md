<p class=date>8:27am CDT Wednesday 11 September 2002</p>

<p>I'm awake and at Kinko's to work on Kim Sawyer's website, updates
on which are due at noon today.  I've got music on in headphones to
keep me focused.  It's due at noon.</p>

<p>Hey, if you're in Dallas area, check out 106.7 KKDL: they play all
dance stuff and they don't play commercials.</p>

<p>Ugh.</p>

<p>I'm hating this.  He sent me a .doc file, which I can't read since
I don't have Star Office installed, so I sent it to yahoo and viewed
it with their .doc to .html viewer and grabbed that source, and now am
spending a lot of time modifying it.  It'd be way easier if I knew for
sure what it was supposed to look like instead of making guesses about
what he wanted.</p>

<p class=date>10:49am</p>

<p>okay I'm done editing poetry and will move it to his site now.  I
may have to do some additional edits to it, but hopefully not much.</p>

<p class=date>12:13pm</p>

<p>Done.  Tad late but oh well.  <a
