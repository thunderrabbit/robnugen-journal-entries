<p>Driving to Austin was pretty straightforward, but a bit long.  Not
too terrible.  I listened to Dr R.C. Sproul, some christian theologean
talk about how everything has meaning because God gives meaning to
everything, after "KKDL Muenster Dallas Fort Worth 106.7" was out of
range.  The girl voice who does the legal IDs for them sounds pretty
cute.</p>

<p>Got into Austin and there was a vigil of some sorts blocking up the
streets near the capital building, so I called Bill to find the best
way around it.  Made it here by recognizing Sally's old building,
which is quite close to Fred's.  Yay Sally!</p>
