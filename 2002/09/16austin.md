<p class=date>6:35pm CDT Monday 16 September 2002</p>

<p>Leaving for Austin now.</p>

<p class=date>6:42pm</p>

<p>Back at Bibby's now, with lots of laughter, "man it was so fast, it
was like we just left yesterday."</p>

<p>I got a piece of glass in my foot at Charity's house when we picked
up some stuff of hers to take to Austin.  For the fun of it, drove
backwards on Bibby's street for fully 1.5 blocks back to their
house.</p>

<p class=date>7:00pm</p>

<p>Got it.  Looked like a little fleck of metal paint or tile.</p>

<p class=date>10:36pm</p>

<p>We're here in Austin now.  Listened to a lot of Eminem really loud
much of the latter half of the trek, after the first half included
Pink Floyd on repeat.</p>

<p>Have just been to the house of a guy who makes art out of found
items, and who might be the same cat who made a picture frame that Jon
gave to me/Wende a couple years ago.</p>

<p class=date>4:34am</p>

<p>Done rearranging Janette's space now at Uncommon Objects.  At 1am,
we visited Magnolia Grill and the waitress was really really nice,
with big smile to the point that it really felt like she was flirting
with <em>me</em>, but I watched her and she was just as friendly with
all the other tables.  She's tallish with short dark straight hair and
an upside down star tattoo inside her right elbow/forearm.</p>

<p>Janette generously gave her a five dollar tip, and I doubled it to
ten after a twelve dollar meal.  As we left, I walked slowly and
watched her get to the table and she was all, "hey, thanks!" and
looked up at us and I blew her a kiss.</p>

<p>Didn't think to give her one of my yellow adventure cards, but oh
well.</p>
