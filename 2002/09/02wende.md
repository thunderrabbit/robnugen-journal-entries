<p>I just chatted with Wende on the phone.  She's in San Francisco now
in a building super close to a sushi restaurant.  She's paying $1600
in rent and has no place near her residence to park her truck.  She
starts work tomorrow as the POS trainer of a Container Store.  Email
me if you want her contact information.</p>

<p>She drove from Houston to SF, and had her mom and 2 cats with her in the
truck.  They had to replace the alternator in some city with a funny
name like Longview in New Mexico.  Then just Saturday she had to
replace the battery on her truck.  Wow.  But she sounds like she's in
good spirits and she gave me blanket permission to say HI to anyone
she knows.</p>

<p>I told her that Jackie Purdy bought the naming rights to the game
Wende and I invented while we were together.</p>

<p>(soon as Jackie pays me the dollar, I'll give fifty cents to
Wende)</p>
