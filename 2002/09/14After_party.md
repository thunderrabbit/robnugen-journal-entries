<p class=date>8:37am CDT Saturday 14 September 2002</p>

<p>I'm pretty much still sleeping since the party.  I have slept while
floating on the pool, sitting in the hottub, sleeping on my back
inside.</p>

<p class=date>10:43am</p>

<p>At Denny's now with Joey 80 cents on the tollway to get here.
We're both glad that we don't live on a tollway ourselves.  The rest
of the group (from Jackie's Party) will be coming shortly.</p>

<p class=date>11:01am</p>

<p>Joey points out that this engagement has been a lot like a rally:</p>

<p>Silent Football 
Mafia 
Dance with strobelight 
Limited sleep 
Denny's
More than one UU (8: Joey, Jackie (Judy, Janice, Jackie the Sackie on
Yackie, Jackie the RE Board Liaison on Yac, Jack the Sac on Yac (SF
name))), Jack the Sac on Yac, Aaron Ryan, Danny Seigal, Ryan McC, Rob,
Janet (friend of Jackie's) (Dave points out that more than 1/2 of the
group now at Denny's is UU)
</p>

<p>Some things made it unlike a rally:</p>

<p>Two per blanket
Pool / Hot tub
Billiards
No talent show
No workshops
Jackie Purdy's birthday
Katy with a Y's birthday
No worship
Aged out UUs (2: Ryan, Danny)
smoking (out front of the house only)
only one night</p>

<p class=date>12:03pm</p>

<p>Nathie has several talents: drumming (in a band), scuba diving (he
argues that it's not a talent, but we argue that he could have
drowned), Etch-A-Sketch drawing (he's apparently really good), and MS
Paint drawing (Katy says he's pretty good at MS Paint, but she sees it
as a bunch of lines and squiggles.  He'll have to show her some of his
better ones, he says.)</p>

<p class=date>12:26pm</p>

<p>Playing Ceiling Wall Floor now.  Most people don't know how to
play.  Good stuff.</p>
