<p>Picked up Hannah from school and then went to the mall for a bit
before picking up Addie from school, but I didn't have shoes so Lisa
gave me her Tae Kwon Do foot cover things to wear!  They're made of
that shiny foam-ish stuff that I've seen life vests made of, and they
just cover the top of the feet!  This is the perfect disguise for my
bare feet to walk around in the mall.</p>

<p>We stopped by a shoe store where Hannah was looking for purple
Converse, but we instead just conversed with the well-pierced
employee, who had most of his piercings hidden or pulled out.  He was
rather entertained by us since we were also playing Don't Bite The
Grape, in which players all have a single grape in their mouth and, as
the name of the game suggests, don't bite it.  Lisa would bite hers
after like 2 seconds.  We gave her another grape, and then another,
and then she chose a tiny pea-sized grape that was easier for her to
ignore.  Hannah and I of course didn't even consider her in the game
anymore.</p>

<p>Hannah and I did rather well, until mine fell out of my mouth and
broke on the floor.  I used the 3 second rule to eat it, but there was
a hair on it.  Eww.  Oh well.</p>
