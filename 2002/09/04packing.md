<p>My roadtrip adventure begins soon, basically by this weekend.  I
feel sorta like I'm going on my first rally, or actually my second
because at the first rally I had no idea what to expect, but at my
second, I sorta kinda had an idea what to expect, but didn't really
know how to prepare for such awesomeness.</p>

<p>So I sorta kinda know what to expect, but I don't know what I need
to bring on my adventure.  I have decided to bring some things but
then the other things that I don't really want to take I'm not sure
what to do with them.  This is the exact same blues song that I was
wailing before SWUUSI as I was getting rid of my other stuff.</p>

<p>But I got rid of it and I was happier without it.  And some of that
which I have taken with me I have hardly touched.  Like my letter
writing materials.  And my box of miscellaneous stuff, that which I
just tossed into a box out of exasperation at the end of my panic
packing spree, intending to process it much sooner than now.</p>

<p>I've basically decided to take with me some clothes, my computer,
sleeping bag, pillow, backpack, pantry (box of non perishible foods),
library (small box of books) (maybe I should just take a few books
that I've actually been reading), </p>

<p>The rest I'm either going to store at Marta's or Bibby's, and some
of it I'm giving away.  Argh this is such a weird process.</p>
