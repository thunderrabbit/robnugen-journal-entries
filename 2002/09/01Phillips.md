<p>Oh my gosh.  I thought I just deleted *all* the Tulsa Rally journal
entries.  Both days and Silent Football and the crazy story of
Calder's and all that wonderfulness.</p>

<p>I actually did delete them all, but fortunately I had just copied
them from another location.  And I don't know any way to get them back
when deleted via rm on command line.  Aw fuck that was scary.</p>

<p>I deleted an entry called 30Denton, but I dunno if I have copied it
to my site already.  But it's okay; I didn't really do all that much
except watch 3 episodes of Simpsons with Marta.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to get the fuck off my computer and take a shower
and sleep.</p>
