<p>I'm at Kinko's now; I have a small list of things to do, including
get reimbursed for mileage to SWUUSI and Tulsa Rally.</p>

<p>Listening to mp3s, right now "I left my wallet in El Segundo" by A
Tribe Called Quest.</p>

<p>Oh, speaking of music, if you're in Dallas area, check out 106.7,
which seems to play only cool dance music.  I wonder if they stream
over internet.  I'll look.</p>

<p>Ah, next mp3 is Amy Leyenberger's "Greensleeves" on harp.</p>

<p>Got most of my stuff done while listening to a lot of music and
reading a lot of livejournal entries.</p>
