<p>Just called Swa'Vet, who I met during production of Dirty Third II,
produced by Wreckshop Records.  She gave me a bunch of phone numbers
of different production companies and record labels and all sorts of
shit.  I'll probably call none of them, except maybe to find an
address for Eminem, but hey I have them just in case.</p>

<p>At the end of our convo, she was all, "write me a card or some
shit; don't fuck around and don't do it, aight?"</p>

<p>"Shit, you can even draw a picture on a piece of paper and send
that to me I don't care just send me somethin'"</p>

<p>She is so funny!!</p>
