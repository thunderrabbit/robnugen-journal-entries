<p>Walked with Lisa around her old neighborhood and heard such
beautiful stories about how she helped her friends convert some
abandoned trolley tracks into a community garden, which now (14 years
later) boasts beautiful trees, benches, irrigation system, and the
blessing by the city now as a National Historic District or something
equally cool.</p>

<p>We walked up and down its length - maybe 1.25 miles, which has been
extended since Lisa last worked on it.  Oh, one thing that really made
me go "wow" is Lisa was all, "I planted that tree for Julie, and I
planted that tree for Hannah and that tree for Addie."  The kids have
<em>trees!</em>  That is so so cool.</p>

<p>Walked around Rhodes College, surrounded by a big fence and many
acres of lush grass and trees.  It's a very expensive private college
according to Lisa.</p>

<p>Heard stories of the community of neighbors and who lived where and
who divorced whom and who sold houses and who rented houses..  Just an
ornate collage of stories all set in this beautiful old neighborhood.</p>

<p>I could hardly describe how cool I thought it is that Lisa helped
build this beautiful thing for her community.  "This counts as
building something for the world," I said referencing the input
Richard Unger gave me a couple years ago.</p>

<p>Such an awesome walk.</p>
