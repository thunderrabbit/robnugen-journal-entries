<p>Drove Hannah banana to her soccer game, as Lisa would otherwise
have a tight schedule picking up Addie from school and taking Hannah.
The game is "way out" in Bolton, wherever the heck that (this) is
with soccer and football fields bordered by trees on one side and
cotton fields on the other.</p>

<p>Light sprinkle of rain, so light that it's hardly noticeable, with
only infrequent drops hitting my screen.  Oh man I just realized I
forgot to bring a jacket.  Pooh.  I hope I don't freeze too much.
Maybe I'll .. oh wait I have my jacket in the car.  Nevermind.</p>

<p>They won the game 3 - 1.  At the very end a girl from the other
team hurt her neck severely enough to have an ambulance called for
her.  My blessing to her: "may this be her favorite story to tell her
kids."</p>

<p>Hannah and I chatted a bit on the way up there and back.  Good
stuff.</p>
