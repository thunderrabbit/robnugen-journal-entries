<p>In Dallas now, this morning paying bills (cell phone, Scott
maintenance, credit card).  Tonight Janette and I are going to Austin
so I can help her with moving stuff around at the resale shop where
she has some items.</p>

<p class=date>2:51pm</p>

<p>I'm slowly learning things about myself as I begin to embrace this
adventure.  I've been planning to go to OKC and figure I'll go there
on Thursday (after helping Janette in Austin for the next couple of
days) and then go to Tulsa, then Little Rock or Hot Springs,
etc....</p>

<p>And then I remember that I told Liza Ely that I might come to Tyler
to see her <a href="https://www.centerofwellbeing.com">Center of Well
Being</a> and such, and I throw my brain into a tizzy trying to
reschedule to get all these visits in.  I don't have to go see her.  I
don't even really know her.  I just gotta begin my adventure and
fucking go.  I don't know why I'm being so scared of taking the first
step.</p>

<p>It's something like I'm looking for permission to go, or approval
that it's the right thing to do.  I'm completely free right now.  No
one and nothing to tell me what to do except myself.  And I trap
myself.</p>

<p>So strange.</p>
