<p>After what might be called Sister Fight Night at dinner, with Addie
and Julie bickering, and then Julie and Hannah bickering, we had the
most outstanding fun this evening bouncing on the trampoline: Lisa and
Julie and I boucing in the rain of the hurricane Isador (?) (why oh
why do they start over every year with A on naming the hurricanes?
This makes it so infrequent to have a hurricane Rob or hurricane
Yolanda and hurricane Zoolander rip up the coastline of some city...)
and then jumping into the hot tub and then back on the trampoline and
back in the hot tub..  So much fun!  The mat of the trampoline was
super slick, so it was easy to fall and possibly a tad more dangerous
than we might oughta have been out there bouncing around in the rain,
but it was oh so much fun!</p>

<p>Went inside around 9:30 to chat with Calder, who wanted to talk
about stuff.  I hope I was helpful for her.</p>
