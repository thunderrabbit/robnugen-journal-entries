<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Driving a car around a block and needing to drop off
Dude and Gene, but at first thinking that I couldn't go but to within
a block of where they needed to be dropped off, but then I realized I
could, so I turned left up this small driveway into a parking lot and
dropped them off.</p>

<p class=dream>They had just helped me carry something in my car to
somewhere or some shit like that.</p>

<p class=dream>In a neighborhood street and up in a window of a two
story house, a little girl was calling to me for attention.  She and I
didn't know each other, but she came running downstairs with her arms
up like, "pick me up" so I did and I asked her name and she said
"Cinderella" secretly and then "Mindy" as her real name but then went
on to explain why she called herself Cinderella.  I told her that I
understood and she didn't have to explain it.</p>

<p class=dream>I did know her older sister, but didn't get a clear
idea of who she was.  Someone from my college days.</p>

<p>I just realized that none of my dreams seem to go backward in time,
like some movies (Momento) or even others that don't go entirely
backwards, but somewhat backwards.  Or maybe they do and I don't
realize it.</p>
