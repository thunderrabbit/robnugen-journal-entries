<p class=date>4:48pm CDT Monday 23 September 2002</p>

<p>At Hannah's soccer game with Lisa. Hannah is Lisa's middle
daughter.  Freshman in high school; she's on their junior varsity.</p>

<p>I've also met Julie, the younger daughter.  Addie is the older
daughter; I haven't met her yet.</p>

<p class=date>11:05pm</p>

<p>Hannah's team came in second place in the soccer game.  Score was 1
to 0.  She did quite well out on the field.</p>

<p>After the game, walked with Lisa and Nora the dog.  Then shopped at
Kroger, then tried to download "Winter" and "Cornflake Girl" from
Kazaah to show Lisa what Tori Amos sounds like on piano.  This
computer connection is AOhell dialup so it took forever and failed
before it got 1/2 way through.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Chilled in the hot tub and now bedtime.</p>
