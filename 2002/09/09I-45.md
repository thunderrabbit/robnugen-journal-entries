<p>Something ridiculously bad happened on I-45 south, according to Fox
news.  Something about a truck and the driver was pinned and his kid
was killed and traffic has been diverted off the freeway and crews are
working on repairing the freeway and hopefully will have it fixed by
tomorrow evening.</p>

<p>Wow, I say.  Wow.</p>

<p>I wonder, I query, what happened?</p>

<p>Turns out some cat drove a tractor trailer around a corner in the
rain and the trailer slid and bonked some columns that had been
supporting an overpass.  The overpass collapsed and crushed the cab,
trapping the driver (who lived), but killed his son who he took with
him on drives occassionally cause they didn't get much time
together.</p>
