<p>At Debbie's I asked her for thoughts on the situation that Doug
brought up to me a few days ago.  She pretty much agrees with me that
I should still go to the rally, that we ought to build support in for
advisors who are part of the fellowship of the larger
congregation.</p>

<p>Her family chihuahua and ferret ran around the living room and
kitchen/dining area a lot.  Funny.  I felt a bit nervous that the
ferret would bite me, but he did not.</p>
