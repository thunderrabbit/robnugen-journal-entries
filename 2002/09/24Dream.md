<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a library writing html to represent entries in a
checkbook register, I was just hardcoding all the entries themselves,
and then realized that it would be much easier in the long run to
write a template and let the entries be stored in a database and let
the comptuer format them nicely.</p>

<p class=dream>I paced around the library a bit and my laptop power
cord got stuck on the opposite side of a shelf than where I had been
so I untangled it and woke up.</p>
