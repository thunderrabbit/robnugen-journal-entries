<p class=date>11:42pm CDT Sunday 1 September 2002</p>

<p>Have arrived back at Marta's house; she was feeling ookey and
wanted to go home tonight instead of tomorrow, which would have been
my preference, but it's all good.  We got a bit delayed after eating
Taco Bell in some Oklahoma town (possibly Beeline) when Scott's check
engine light came on and we drove back a few miles to get a quart of
oil at Wal-Mart cause everything else was closed.</p>

<p>Played many rounds of Jackie Purdy's Game, and Marta kept winning
easily with all her theatre experience and musicals, etcetera.  I even
cheated and used different lines from the same Eminem song and she
still won.</p>

<p>Lots of "Whose house?  Run's house!!  I said whose house???  Run's
house!  Say what say what?  Martin!  Martin!" and variants including
lines from Southpark movie ("HII DEE ho.....") and everything funny we
could think of.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Just watched a few more episodes of the Simpsons.  Time for bed.</p>
