<p>So Lisa and I are here at Mud Island, which is not actually an
island, but an over commercialized penninsula.  Not like a damn
shopping center, but a boat launch for kayaks and airboats and paddle
boats and plenty of water related activites.  I felt pretty cynical
towards all that so I didn't want to go kayaking as we had planned,
but I was willing to wade through the model of the Mississippi river
that spans nearly a couple hundred yards in length.  Most fun has been
two different sets of (model) rapids, where we used our feet to create
a dam and watched the water backwash after we let our flood go.  I
vaguely have a sense of the physics that I imagine are involved, which
I explained as best that I could.</p>

<p>I sat my butt in the river basin to block it, but didn't make the
water as impressively deep as I had hoped.  But my butt still got
pretty wet.</p>

<p>The next set of rapids, beside which we are sitting now, we were
much more effectively able to block, to the point that the styrofoam
boat race up river was stalled until we let it go.  I don't think the
participants knew of the blockade ahead of them, and I didn't even
think about them when we blocked it, but after we let the river go
again, they seemed to start moving down river again more quickly.</p>

<p>Lisa suddenly went philosophical about cause and effect and affects
that we cause without our awareness.</p>
