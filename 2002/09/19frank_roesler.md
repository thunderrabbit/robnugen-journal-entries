<p>Frank Roesler called me this morning to confirm that I could call
him tonight anytime to bunk out with him tonight.  I rolled in to OKC
and called him, but no answer.  Called him again just recently and no
answer.  I will call Tiffany to see if she has other ideas.  I wonder
if I'll sleep in my car tonight.  I'm not likely to go urban camping
as Jack might, but the phrase still echoes in my mind.</p>

<p>Just called Tiffany; I'll meet up with them at Varsity Sports
Grill.</p>
