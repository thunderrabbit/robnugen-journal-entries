<p>Wow.  This is the first time I've been to a Kinko's that charges
for their internet access.  But here is the weirdest part: I am able
to ssh to my account, and therefore assume I can move my journal
entries online via scp, but I cannot get http requests or smtp
requests (web and email).  Wow.</p>

<p>I wonder why they allow some internet traffic instead of disabling
all.</p>

<p>Muwahahaha! Even though part of my journal update process normally
requires a http request, I am able to ssh to my account and run that
perl executable from the command line.  Yay for free semi-internet
access!</p>

<p>Double Muwahahahah!  I got around their system simply by bypassing
a box underneath the desk here.  My IP address jumped from 192.168
something to 10.14 something and now full access!  Whoohoo!!  Jon,
tell Karina or send me her address.  :-)</p>
