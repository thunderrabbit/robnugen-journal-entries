<p>Fun funny stuff rolling around laughing with all the old school
stories from YRUU/YA and neither.  Quite interesting to hear some
stories about peeps that I never would have guessed.</p>

<p>They are all going to a show now, and I'm going to the city (as
they refer to OKC, which is only 20 miles away), but first, oh yeah,
I'm going to say HI to Debu.</p>
