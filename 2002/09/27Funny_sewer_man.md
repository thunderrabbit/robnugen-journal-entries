<p>Three, no four cats came to unclog the sewer line today.  It was
interesting in the way that watching someone dig a 6 foot hole, cut a
pipe, pull out tree roots, replace and reseal the pipe, fill up the
hole is interesting, but with one detail extra.</p>

<p>The guy named Dickie was so funny!  It started as he was in the
hole smoking a cigarette that he just held in his mouth and hadn't
ashed for a full inch and then he just threw it on the ground and
said, "get outta here, you're killin' me."</p>

<p>He made little video game sounds as he dug and tossed dirt.  He'd
say "moosh moosh moosh" every time he mushed some dirt or mud.  "Hey
where'd my gloves go?   Oh I gottem on I just couldn't tell with all
the dirt on 'em."</p>

<p>"Help me!  I dug myself into a hole and can't get out!"</p>

<p>Out of the hole he pulled out a cigarette. "Well, I decided to
start smokin' again."</p>

<p>As they were filling in the hole, replanting the shrubbery (no
herrings) and flowers, he mimicked a spouse, "honey, are you sure they
worked on the sewer?  I can't tell a difference!"</p>

<p>He was funnnny funny funny.</p>
