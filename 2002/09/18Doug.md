<p class=date>2:22pm CDT Wednesday 18 September 2002</p>

<p>Here at Plano church to meet with Doug Strong at 2:30, and to get
my stuff and to fill out a criminal background check so I can get $
for driving youth to Tulsa.</p>

<p class=date>4:00pm</p>

<p>Apparently, the Plano church (?) adults sorta freaked about me
apparently being a youth advisor at Plano church, but not having gone
through the background check thing.  "Why is Rob hanging out with
these youth?"  and "Rob is too permissive with the youth."  Doug asked
them WTF that was supposed to mean, but got no answer.</p>

<p>So then he asked if any of them have talked to Rob.  No.  No one
has approached me to say they perceive a problem or anything like
that.</p>

<p>Doug went on to say that though the youth would want me to go to
San Antonio Rally, some adults might vote otherwise.  And that I might
just want to think about the outlandish idea of the possibility of me
not going to San Antonio Rally.</p>

<p>Realistically I'm like fuck that; this is my second to last rally
with these fantastic youth and I'm not going to not go to the rally
based on some rumor that someone has a problem with me not being based
at a church but they won't approach me with their concern.</p>

<p>To cover my ass I will contact Steve Feinstein to get his input,
but I really don't think he will see any profound problems with me
attending.</p>
