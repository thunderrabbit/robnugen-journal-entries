<p>I'm sitting up on the unfinished third level of Tanner's tree house
behind his house.  I can't really say it's Tanner's tree house; I'm
sure his brother and dad have worked on it equally well.  It's a cool
house.</p>

<p>Wow!  Amelia is here!  Mattboy and Kevin are here and now Tanner is
joining us.  Man, who told him about this place?</p>

<p>There is a rope growing inside a tree; apparently a tornado came
through and blew the rope through the tree.  Amazing.</p>
