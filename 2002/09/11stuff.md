<p>Super duper excited to see Sally tomorrow!  Fred, Bill and I just
watched <em>Fear of a Black Hat</em> the spoofumentary of NWH, Niggas
With Hats.  "See Niggahs stands for Nice Intelligent .." aw man I
forget what he said but it was funny.</p>

<p>During my drive here to Austin from Dallas, when 70 miles north of
Austin, I was able to hear Clint's Blues In Hi-Fi on KTRU, which is
actually broadcast from an antenna in Humble.  Lotsa miles that signal
traveled.  I called Clint to let him know.</p>

<p>The movie store where we got this movie is pretty cool - um, little
hand written reviews on some of the movie boxes, and a free membership
if you give them a blockbuster card (they destroy them by making them
into decorations on their little tree).</p>

<p>Tired.  Shower then bed.</p>
