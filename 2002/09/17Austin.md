<p>We slept in a bit and then I dropped off Janette at her antique
space while I visited my mom at her condo.  Talked about the latest
haps for a couple hours and then I went back to get Janette.  We
visited Barton Springs and chilled (pun intended) in the water a bit
and then ate at Trudy's.  Invited Fred to join us, which he did after
he woke up and he entertained Janette with Fred-stories until he
cruised to school to do homework.  Janette and I walk walk walked and
found a cooler worth of ice discarded on the street, where we cooled
our footses for a bit.  Then visited the restrooms in a Baptist church
across the street.</p>

<p>Visited Amy's Ice Cream, which she has never been to before and
parked at Fred's apartment then walked to campus where we got online
and I chatted briefly with Asha, Ashley (sorta), Phat Pat, Tanner,
Sean, Suzanne and checked my email and downloaded my livejournal
friends' entries.</p>

<p>Janette got a ticket when we were just a few miles from Dallas.
That sucks.  The cop-girl was all, "I clocked you going 70 in a 50 mph
zone with a laser radar from one thousand seven hundred ninety-five
feet."</p>

<p>Wow.  That's amazing.</p>
