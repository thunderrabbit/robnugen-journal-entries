<p class=date>8:00am CDT Friday 28 June 2002</p>

<p>I'm sitting meditatively now.</p>

<p class=date>10:08am</p>

<p>That lasted about 9 minutes, and then I worked on my marble track
some.</p>

<p>Now I'm at Christina Branmart's house.  Her patience with Mia is
incredible and refreshing.  When I am a parent, I want to parent
similarly.</p>

<p class=date>11:42am</p>

<p>Christina smiled in a way that said <em>silly Rob</em> when I got
my computer to capture this moment.  I've never had the fun type of
experience at Whole Foods before with all the samples overflowing with
goodies during the day.  I usually only come here at night when
there's almost nothing left to munch.</p>

<p class=date>12:05pm</p>

<p>Just met Roger here in the cafe section of Whole Foods.  He has
recently purchased a 4 unit condo thing on a mountain in New Mexico.
He's traveling to France, Italy, Spain soon.  He blessed and
encouraged my adventure.</p>

<p>For some reason, I don't have my business cards on me, so I drew
him a replica on back of Whole Foods receipt tape.</p>

<p class=date>1:10pm</p>

<p>Christina will email me a list of people around the US who would
enjoy hosting parts of my adventure.  Such a fantastic blessing are
our connections from YRUU.</p>
