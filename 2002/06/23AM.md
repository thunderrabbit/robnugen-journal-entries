<p>Last night after the movie at Dude's I fell asleep while scp was
copying my entire website from robnugen.com to this machine for
archival purposes.  The only silly thing is that it copied multiple
times directories and files that were symlinks to one another.  So I
have multiple copies of my entire public_html folder and of my images
folder, which was included in my public_html folder, blah blah blah.
But I have a copy of the whole thing.  I prune it and tar it and throw
it on a CD...  maybe I won't tar it.</p>

<p>I was so tired last night that I left my computer at Dude's at 5am
when I left.  I got home to write a tired-version of the paragraph
above and discovered why my backpack had been so light.</p>

<p>My dad is coming over in a few minutes to have a Rob and Dad day 1
week after Father's day.</p>
