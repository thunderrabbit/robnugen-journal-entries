<p class=date>2:30pm CDT Friday 28 June 2002</p>

<p>I just stopped by Amy's Ice Cream to see if they would be
interested in having me work for two weeks.  JD will ask Glen if it
will be worth it to them.</p>

<p>Now I'm outside of Catherine's house; when she arrives we'll do
some yoga.</p>

<p class=date>3:46pm</p>

<p>Yoga was fun.  I'm going to Spy tonight to see if she can help get
me a job as a doorman, checking IDs and such.</p>

<p class=date>9:31pm</p>

<p>Went to La Jaliscience with Marta, who came in from Denton to see
her sister.  She and I will visit Paint This! tomorrow.</p>

<p>Talked to Wende tonight; told her of my plans.  She was fully
supportive and asked good questions.  I had already asked the same
questions of myself, so the discussion was not as challenging as I had
feared it might be.  In fact, she was quite supportive of my decision,
and for this I am thankful.</p>
