<p>Hee!  I just tweaked my journal-start macro so that I can run it
from within any buffer of emacs and it won't affect the current buffer
I'm in (unless it's *scratch*).</p>

<p>I have just picked up my new business cards from Kinko's for
$19.11.  500+ cards.  They look great!</p>

<p>I'm at Empire Cafe to meet Kim Sawyer, for what may be my last
coaching session with him, unless he's sure we can get our barter
worked out.</p>

<p class=date>10:43am</p>

<p>Good stuff with Kim.  I have just sent three referrals to Nova -
priority mail for $12.95; they will be delivered by high noon
tomorrow.  I called Nicole to let her know to look for them.  I also
wrote her a note on Power Puff Girls stationary.</p>

<p>I have just added a <a

button to my journal.  I have considered doing this in the past, but
now I think people are more likely to be moved to do so.</p>

<p>If you donate to my adventure, be sure to enter your address and
I'll send you a postcard!</p>

<p>Lunch with Kristen soon; I'm going to make PB&J and meet her at
Hobbit Cafe.</p>
