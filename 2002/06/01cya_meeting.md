Discussion now of Ways to Support Advisors

* Be intentional at first so it's built into the culture

* Need to have advisors register

* Have a signup list at checkin; "are you new?"

* Expand this beyond the rally: "Steve will be your mentor this year"

* CYA needs to write a script to contact the new advisor

--------

Advisor orientation at rallies:

* Maybe have a morning meeting on Saturday to orient those who came in
  late.

* Advisor meeting in the AM, Instead of at night, because it's the new
  advisors who we need to talk to anyway.

* set up a spirit committee to introduce at the adult meeting.
  Recommend: 2 local youth and 2 YAC youth and 1 local adult and 1
  district adult.

* we think new advisors should know: look up difference between
    "advise" and "lead" shared ministry

(((( Communication: how to publicize what great things were done at
     the rally? what was social action?  what was favorite game?  who
     did you meet?

     "Meet the Advisor" column in local newsletters  

     Send your youth to SWUUSI: "don't sweat it; we will"  )))))
