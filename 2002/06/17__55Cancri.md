Cancri</a> is a star with a planet similar to Jupiter.  This star system is
41 light years away, and according to the article, would take 1 million
years for one of our spacecraft to get there (at current
technology/velocity).</p>

<p>I'm recording this to make note of the state of astronical technology (at
least as reported by US media).</p>
