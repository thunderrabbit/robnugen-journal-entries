<p>Oh my gosh Erika just came in and I'm all "HI!!!!!!!!" on the
inside and totally poker-face on the outside cause her mom is totally
right nearby anytime Erika happens to be near me.  I don't know if
it's intentional, but I'm not too surprised if it is because on a
different occassion, Karla wisked Erika off to lunch so that I
wouldn't be distracted.</p>
