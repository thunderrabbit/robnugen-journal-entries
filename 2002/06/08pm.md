<p>Dr John Spear (sp) talking now about racism.   We'll be watching a video
in a moment.</p>

<p>Oh, for our social action, we'll be volunteering at a Special Olympics.
Awesome!</p>

<p>Arthur showed us a new game from Brazil, two players each try to hit the
feet of the other player with socks.  Not throwing, but a sock balled up in
a sock and swing socks to try and hit the other.  Fun game.  He said in
Brazil it's played with sticks.  Ouch!</p>

<p>Joey tried a bit to get the answer to the Infinite Questions we are
playing for the pastsome months.</p>
