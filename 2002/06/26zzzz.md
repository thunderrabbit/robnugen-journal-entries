<p>Just heard from Daniel; he razzed me a bit but was less concerned
than I was.  Ironic that Diana missed a date with me, and I missed a
date with Daniel, all in one day.</p>

<p>Have just finished scoping out theWealthSource and <a
href="https://www.spiritblueeagle.com">spiritBlueEagle.com</a>.  I like
the structure of the Spirit Blue Eagle site.</p>

<p>Going home now.</p>
