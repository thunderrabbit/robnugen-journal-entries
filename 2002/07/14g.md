<p>Fred is at my apartment helping me redesign how my journal entries
are read.  I had a guess that he would involve regular expressions
somehow parsing something, but had no idea what he would parse with
them; I'm trying to read a bunch of files from a directory
structure.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We were interrupted twice by phone calls, and were standing in the
kitchen drinking water when it was time to get back to work.  I asked,
"did you think of a way to do the directory indexing, taking into
consideration my criteria?"</p>

<p>Fred looked up at me, seriously considered the appropriate answer,
then replied, "huh?"</p>

<p>We both laughed a lot.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I was right; he suggested using regular expressions on a file that
we create the represents the directory structure.  Excellent.</p>

<p>So he set off to write the code to read the file, and I am going to
create a mock-up of the file.  "But first," he suggested, "music."</p>

<p>He looked through the CDs that I have allocated for him and
selected either Marilyn Manson or The Simpsons.  Excellent.  I
appreciate that we both equally appreciate such diverse styles.</p>
