<p class=date>11:02am CDT Thursday 18 July 2002</p>

<p>I was up until 5am last night working on my website, not working on
moving.  Time to pack.  Panic Pack.  :-)</p>

<p class=date>8:36pm</p>

<p>At around 4:30pm Wende helped me pack my clothes for SWUUSI and my
trek.  Super duper special thanks to her for that.</p>

<p>At Bombay Palace with Catherine.  Funniest thing was when the train
went by and I was all, "is it going this direction?" and indicated
with my thumb, and she nodded yes, then goes, "no," and starts moving
her eyes as if watching it go by the other direction.  Funny!</p>

<p>To Catherine's house so I could read a bit from her Culture Shock
India book.  Then big hug and I'll miss you's.</p>

<p class=date>12:32am</p>

<p>Fred and I arrived at Kinko's and Swa'vet was here with Greg.  As
they were leaving Swa'vet was all, "Rob. Call me tomorrow."</p>

<p>"I'm leaving tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Then call me in the morning before you leave."</p>

<p>"What's your number?"</p>

<p>As Swa'vet was getting her card out of her purse, Junie and Greg
were both talking, actually all three of them were, and she gave me
her card in a multi-tasking type way, then as she left says to me,
"Rob, stop fucking around and call me tomorrow."</p>

<p>Fred and I laughed for several minutes at that.</p>

<!-- p>They're at 3440 Belfort tomorrow.</p -->
