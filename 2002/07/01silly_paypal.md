Dear paypal,

It has recently come to my attention that I cannot use
American Express as my official verifyable bank account
for use with Paypal.  When I called your customer 
service, I could not get a more detailed answer than
"they don't meet the criteria for our authorization
process."

I believe your authorization process is to send them
a couple of ACH transactions, and then have me tell
you what was each amount.

American Express is able to accept ACH transactions.
They are an electronic bank.

Will you let me know why you guys don't like American
Express?  I like them.  They're nice guys and gals,
just like you.

      Thanks
      - Rob

<p>So that sums up the problem I'm having with Paypal.  Still feel
free to send large sums of money through the donate button; I'll
figure out a way to accept it.</p>
