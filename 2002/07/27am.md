<p class=date>9:58am CDT Saturday 27 July 2002</p>

<p>Awake.  Unpacking and repacking my car to go visit the Bibby's for
a few days.  Ironically, Sean is in Utah now, so I can't hang out with
him exactly yet.</p>

<p class=date>4:52pm</p>

<p>Been chillin' with Janette, Sean and Joey's mom.  Joey just woke up
a bit ago.  Janette has been cooking all day ("20 hours" she says) and
I've helped a tiny bit by cutting parsley (I think) and jalepenos and
mixing tabouli.  We've been listening to some of my KTRU tapes.</p>
