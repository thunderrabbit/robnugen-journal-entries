<p>Last night Wende arrived; it was close to dark when I first saw
her.  We went toward worship together.  I imagined that she would feel
jealous that I was holding Bryn's hand, so I held Wende's hand as we
entered the worship space.</p>

<p>I'm glad Wende was able to attend SWUUSI; it looks like this will
be her last YRUU event in Southwest District for a while.</p>
