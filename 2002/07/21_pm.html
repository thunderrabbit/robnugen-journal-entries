<p class=date>8:27pm CDT Sunday 21 July 2002</p>

<p>I got the opportunity to listen to Erin share about stuff in her
life.  The culmination of this event was her eating for the first time
in two days.</p>

<p>I missed the advisor meeting, and therefore haven't signed up for
rover duty.  Eeep.</p>

<p>Now I'm down by the lake but, again, there's only one advisor (me).</p>

<p class=date>8:31pm</p>

<p>Ah, Steve is here.  [splash splash splash splash]</p>

<p class=date>9:29pm</p>

<p>Cake: on the table, on the stereo, on Tanner, Bryn, Chris.</p>

<p>Tonight is the first night dance.  Lots of peeps chilling and
dancing and such.</p>

<p>Debbie hollering, "No!  Just let one song play all the way through!
I like that song.  leave it right there.  what is the problem???"</p>

<p class=date>11:03pm</p>

<p>Time for worship soon.  We have successfully had the first night's
check in at our touch groups.  Our group got to meet Hunter from
Houston, new to our group.</p>

<p>We'll probably have a Silent Football game after worship.  I'm not
sure though.</p>

<p class=date>11:28pm</p>

<p>David and I just figured out another way to play the psychic number
game.  We can get numbers up to 63, but we're sticking with 50 to make
our technique less obvious.  We also amazed Chez by communicating
"Penelope Cruz" and "Jimmy Fallon"  Nice.</p>

<p>Worship soon maybe.</p>

<p class=date>12:17am</p>

<p>I stood between Bryn and Wende at worship.  Good thing we were all
holding hands in the circle cause I was falling asleep, using them to
keep my balance while standing (and sleeping).</p>

<p>Bryn wore no sleeves, had a bit of trouble with mosquitoes.</p>

<p>Nice first night worship.  Very appropriate.</p>

<p class=date>1:05am</p>

<p>Calder is leading a Silent Football game.  I'm thrilled about that;
she is even showing new people how to play.  I hope the game goes
well.  I won't be there for I have set up my bed on the road by the
lake.</p>

<p class=date>2:28am</p>

<p>Bryn and Chris came down to sleep as well.</p>
