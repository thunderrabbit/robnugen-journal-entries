<p>Today was full.  Bryn and Gram got married; I got to walk Bryn down
the aisle, which was a great honor.  They were married down by the
dock amidst much excitement and giggling.  Just after the ceremony, it
started to sprinkle a bit.</p>

<p>On the way back up to the camp, Wende's truck carried me in the
front, Bryn and Gram in the bench seat, a pile of people on the
tailgate, and Kenny riding on the step on the passenger's side of the
truck.  Good fun stuff.</p>

<p>Before the wedding, the junior high came to visit and we all had a
great water fight.  I didn't actually participate, but I watched from
the side.  Didn't want to get wet again, but we ended up all swimming,
breathing air under a submerged blue mixing bowl, and shooting lots of
water guns.  Oh, and we lost the big ball again, and the same boat
brought it back again.</p>

<p>Most unique thing was me, Lawren, Daveed under an overturned raft,
and a small fish swimming curiously slowly between us, without fear,
even though we were so close.  It was about the size of half my palm.</p>

<p>Chilled with Abbey a bit before and during dinner; talked about
some old continental level stuff we've done, and a bit about Southwest
District's attitudes toward youth.</p>

<p>Oh, Laura Nagel announced that Nathan Sexton is in jail.  D'oh.</p>
