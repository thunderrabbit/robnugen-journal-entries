<p>Dance now.</p>

<p class=date>12:07am Tuesday 23 July 2002</p>

<p>Dance was great though not a lot of fast songs were played.  We
still danced plenty and mostly everyone was drenched with sweat, and
not just from dancing; it's hot!</p>

<p>Played a couple Eminem songs, but neither of them finished because
the CD player didn't seem to stay consistent through any entire song.
It's all good though.</p>

<p>After dance was touch group meetings, but before that Erin
expressed some of her sadness to me that came up during the prison
reform workshop, during part of which I slept.</p>

<p>In touch group we played Green Glass Doors (what can you take
through them?  (the same things that you can Take to The Moon)) and
everyone got it after a while except for Hunter I think.  But it's all
good as well.</p>

<p>Um, then worship was cool with improv vocal/body music including
beat boxing and elements from our human instruments (from touch group)
and the techno song that David and I have performed.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Instead of a hug exchange circle, we did something like the
unconditional honoring love gaze into one another's eyes for 10 or 15
seconds each.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Then beautiful was the Lean On Me performed by four voices (Abbey
T, Laura C, Steve F, Richard W) and then by the group.</p>

<p>Silent Football now-ish.</p>
