<p>Super thanks to Roy for using his Maintenance Man Magic (key) to
switch on three washers for me in the laundry room.  All I did was ask
if he can get me some change.  He did even better than that.  :-)</p>

<p>I've just gotten my front tire fixed at University Schwinn.
Actually they said it was cheaper to just replace the tube.  The labor
costs are much higher to repair it.  So I kept the old tube (shoulda
asked if they had any others recently thrown away) so I can fix it
later with my newfound time.</p>

<p>Chillin' at Veronica's now; Dude is not here.  But I just dropped
off my old NT box, my <a href="http://www.apcc.com">APC</a> UPS,
Netopia DSL router, and extra cords.</p>
