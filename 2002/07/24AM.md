<p class=date>10:12am CDT Wednesday 24 July 2002</p>

<p>I set up a one way wormhole from myself to Erin so that I wouldn't
have to worry about moving the football during the latter part of the
silent football game last night.  That worked well, but I began to
fall asleep as I didn't have to keep track of anything going on.  Or,
not as much.</p>

<p>Slept down by the lake and was presented with a beautiful moonset
near the end of the night.  Ver ver nice.</p>

<p>Just had breakfast of fruit and bagels after spirit circle.  I led
a long version of Aristasha for the group this morning.</p>

<p>Chris and Noah both asked me to go swimming; I said yes to each of them.</p>
