Bron!!

I'm super glad to hear that you guys loved the soap dish, and I
laughed aloud when I read it's being used as a phone card holder!
That's completely hilarious to me!

The 17th through 31st of August are currently unstructured days for
me.  I have a bit of resistance to driving that far, or paying for a
ticket, but depending on how the next week or so goes for selling my
stuff and moving out, I may do it.

Let me know how your itenerary develops and we can figure out a plan.

My cat's name is Spot.  He's got some pics on my website.
http://www.robnugen.com and click images, then cats, then look for
Spot In Box near the bottom of the page I think.  (I'm composing this
entry while I'm offline, so I can't look it up exactly right now)

I'm having an apartment sale (instead of a garage sale) to sell all my
stuff.  I am getting some boxes from the local grocery to start
packing stuff to store at friends and family homes.  Today is our
independence day celebration so I'm going to visit with my friends
from college.

	With Love
	- Rob!
