<p>Crunch went the fire pit.  Tina yelled "YOU RAN OVER THE FIRE!!"
Then when he backed up trying to look at the damage done up front, he
bumped into a tree.</p>

<p>Oh no!!!!  Sean just went "Bwwababqbwbwaaaaa!!!"</p>

<p>First advisor meeting after cream cheese and peanut butter bagel.
Tanner was all, "that sounds gross.  but it's cool that you're eating
it."  :-)  Funny.</p>

<p>Joe and Amber slept in an air conditioned car last night.</p>

<p>Advisor meeting with Debu in charge was good but a bit long for me.
Now after two bowls of cereal and soy milk, I'm down with advisors and
youth leaders for the Power Shuffle Pre-history and stuff.</p>

<p>Amy Leyenberger just gave an <em>EXCELLENT</em> answer to "What is
the purpose of Power Shuffle?"</p>

<p>My favorite part of the planned Power Shuffle is that when people
process after the Power Shuffle, they get to choose their groups:
process with people they know and love best.</p>

<p>Took several tries to get my cell phone message to say without
static "Hi this is Rob, and the apartment has been rented and I'll be
out of town until the 28th. Bye."</p>

<p>Little bit of booty dancing and gave Bryn the Spam-ku book, gave
Tanner the Hello Nasty Beastie Boys poster.  Will give to Rick my
tiled chalice. I remembered Kat Checkley's name, introduced her
around.</p>

<p>Hethre has scheduled a Silent Football Rules workshop so the rule
description during the game can be faster.</p>
