Rob!

GA ended exactly a week ago and I have beAn home since
last thursday, but kT was there!  she didn't put
anything in the mugbook either, but she is spending
the summer in brooklyn so i assume thats where she is
now?!

GA was awesome and a totally needed break from
pressures at home that were mounting.  so everything
is just awesome!  A good friend that i made at GA from
Ohio, Chris Weber (on steering committee and very
cool) is probably going to come to swuusi!  he is also
friends with sean, laura d., and abbey tennis so we
are all excited about it!

other than that i am working just about full time at
two jobs and rocking it out as much as i can when i'm
not working.  i'm about to meet a bunch of girlfriends
for dessert so i need to go but i love you heaps and
will see you in less than three weeks!
woo hoo!
smiles,
me

| Bryn!
| 
| I got your card from GA yesterday; thank you so much
| for that!  I would 
| like to send kT a card; if you get this before the
| end of GA (today?) will 
| you ask her what is the optimal address to send it?
| 
| I'm still in my apartment; it's not rented out yet,
| but it's 90% likely 
| that Dave from my ex-work will take over my lease. 
| I have bought an ad in 
| Houston Press, which should hit the streets in two
| days.  Dave is also 
| going to buy my bed and blue recliner.  I will place
| ads for selling my 
| futon and chest of drawers and desk.
| 
| I get internet access free of charge from Kinko's,
| which is right across 
| the freeway from me, so it's closer than my work
| was.
| 
| I'll enjoy talking with you about plans while we're
| at SWUUSI.
| 
| I'll reply more to this email later, probably
| tonight.
| 
| 	  With Love
| 	  - Rob!!
