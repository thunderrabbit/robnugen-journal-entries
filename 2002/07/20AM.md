<p class=date>6:58am CDT Saturday 20 July 2002</p>

<p>Awake now.  Leaving Dude's soon to go to Dallas then SWUUSI.  Will
get breakfast on the way out.</p>

<p class=date>7:27am</p>

<p>I'm at America's Service Center, across the street from my ex
apartment complex.  Fred poured oil into my car last night to top it
off and said something weird seemed to come out of the bottle and into
the engine.  He described it as a lump, but couldn't say better than
that what it might have been.  Probably not a marble, but maybe a
clump of dried oil?  So I'm getting my oil changed.</p>

<p>Just as I pulled into the station the <em>Check Engine</em> light
came on, so maybe something needs to be checked.  Very convenient
timing.</p>
