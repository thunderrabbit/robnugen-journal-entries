<p>happy shrugs-a-lot is now known as Tony Chestnut. (singing) </p>

<p>"i really dont like the motions that that girl makes... then
asha flicks him off. :-P improperly using the zoom. tony chestnut was
deeply offended by it... "fucking scarred for life." </p>

<p>"what is wrong with little bunny foo foo?" "little bunny foo foo
picks up little field mice and bops them on the head.  that's what's
wrong with little bunny foo foo." adrienne had to dance to it while mr
pat shot imaginary guns at her to make her dance "mr dictator, i ran
out of bullets..." mr dictator said something like 'just lower the gun
below the TV like this and when you raise it again it'll be reloaded."
wow. magic. </p>

<p>Calder stole it from Pat, gave it to Rob, stole it from Rob, fwapped
it using the wrong (right) hand on Rob's left leg.
<br>rob also snorted when he laughed. </p>

<p>pat fwapped to himself, fwapped to himself again, and then reveresed
the direction of the fwap to fwap to calder. 
<br>laura said "wheeeee" and got 1/2 a penance point for saying "we". 
<br>Daniel and human chalice got a wormhole. so did adrienne and laura
<br>rob said 2 way black hole hahaha in out in out what kind of black hole
is this? 
<br>human chalice has been drinking too many martini glasses because
martini glasses are chalices - pat. 
<br>"i do not enjoy the sound effects
quote pewn! unquote." -pat as well. </p>

<p>calder didn't notice that she had the ball and pat kept nodding at
laura who eventually was tricked and zoomed the ball. curses. what a
jerk pat is. he lied and said he was misunderstood and received 1.5 a
penance point for false info, lying across wormholes(or something),
and lying to cover butt. </p>

<p>pat went to go take a shower so that he can get his mack
on. inappropriate. (dissapprpriate)
<br>what are you doing" we're playing silent football... no, we're playing
fucking basketball. mr kevin joins the gamme, he doesn't know aboout
wormholes. 
<br>we all said that we like human chalice individually, starting with
laura. daniel said it last and was given .5 a penace point for
succumbing to peer pressure. calder said that the only ones who really
love her are sexy shorts and mr dictator. there is now a debate about
it. apparenly calder would lust for herself too but she doesn't have
to cuz she is herself. wonderful bond etc quote we unquote... bla bla
bla "shut up! jesus christ! this hurts!" - adrienne. human chalice
will now be ignored for 3 minutes. </p>

<p>calder's singing while being ignored. "i have a minute left... 25
seconds.." plus one minute for talking. plus one minute for assaulting
mr. dictator. she's been singing "be kind to our fine feathered
friends on "doo doo do do dood oo" and time. she keeps getting more
for talking and assaulting mr dictator. she wasn't even aware that she
had the ball. actually what she was singing was, as adrienne described
it, "that little tune that is slightly patriotic." </p>

<p>Daniel leaves the game and amber joins. 
human chalice wants to know where her other half is. "'ts right
there." apparently "'ts right" isn't a pronoun. </p>

<p>human chalice has, yet again, recieved a half a penance point for
wasting the universes time and then for repeating herself. she also
requests to leave the universe because she is hallucinating... there
is a dragon above her head. hehe. "theres a dragon right there too."
"I know. don't look at it," says Mr Dictator. she lost. she so
lost. hahaha arguing she had 4.5 and rob said the 4.5 from her last
game turned into a half. then that she got the points from the other
game or something. he;s the dictator, he can do what he wants. pat's
back. still singing. he was singing in the shower.  the game is over.</p>
