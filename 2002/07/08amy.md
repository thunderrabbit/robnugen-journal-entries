<p>Hung out at Amy's house while she whipped together some design
concepts for Kim Sawyer's websites.  I was quite impressed with her
agility in photoshop.  "I feel like my grandmother watching me on the
computer."</p>

<p>"If it makes you feel any better, I did go to school for this."</p>

<p>Actually, that does help.</p>

<p>She pulled together a concept for my site as well.  I think I can
easily put an image here.</p>
