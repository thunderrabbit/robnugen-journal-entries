<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I've just been awakened by Joel, with whom I've hardly spoken in
our YRUU years together.  He's just seemed well connected within the
community; I never approached him, and he never approached me..  until
now.</p>

<p>Such amazing connections can be made in YRUU so amazingly quickly
and with profound depth.  I'm so ..... touched.  Honored.  Thrilled to
have been allowed this opportunity to begin a conversation with
Joel.</p>

<p>Thank you.  Thank you.</p>
