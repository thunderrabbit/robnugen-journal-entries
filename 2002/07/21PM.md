<p class=date>2:44pm CDT Sunday 21 July 2002</p>

<p>Bryn and David swing danced until they got too hot.  Chris and I
stood in the shade to watch.  Bryn liked going behind David because he
has glitter all over his back.</p>

<p>Went swimming and rode around on the yellow raft with Sean and
Abbey until it got ganked by Mikey.  Helped Phat Pat pick up big rocks
and skip them (and by skip them I mean not skip them).</p>

<p>Chatted with Abbey for a bit about school and plans and such.
Might say HI to her in Ohio when I'm up that way.</p>
