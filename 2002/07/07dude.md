<p>Chillin' at Dude and Veronica's house now, after Wende and I
watched Men In Black 2.  Movie was pretty good, but I don't know if
better than the first one.  Certainly as good as the first.</p>

<p>Funniest parts were when Jay (Will Smith) was neuralizing the
witnesses.  A couple of them were funny.</p>

<p>Dude and I are IMing each other across the room talking about new
design for my front page.</p>

<p>We're such geeks.</p>

<p>Wow.  We've gotten a pretty cool design for my site.  I have a .jpg
for it so far.  It will take a while to implement, but I think it will
be quite fly once it's in place.  Super thanks to Dude for creating
the .jpg and pointing me to a site for concepts on how to do
calendars.</p>
