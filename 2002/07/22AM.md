<p class=date>6:35am CDT Monday 22 July 2002</p>

<p>Watching the lake slowly light up.  There are three youth on the
dock now.  I recognize Wes's hat, but the others I cannot identify
from this far away.  The coolest thing just flew by: a flock of about twenty
honking geese about one foot above the water's surface.  I don't know if
the picture will come out.  I barely got my camera out in time.</p>

<p class=date>6:44am</p>

<p>The three youth just walked back.  Casey is one of those I couldn't
identify.  I don't remember the name of the third.  All three are new
to SWUUSI this year.</p>

<p>This is interesting, a fourth youth <!Andrea> who came down around
6:40 waited on the road until the three youth on the dock left.  Now
that they are gone, she has entered the dock and has it to
herself.</p>

<p class=date>7:14am</p>

<p>Sean came down to wake everyone up for opening circle.  There are
four youth down closer to the lake.  They are at least awake as
opposed to Bryn and Chris.</p>

<p>I'm going up now.</p>

<p class=date>8:03am</p>

<p>At opening circle I led the Labadoo song, a new one to this
district.  It's one that I just read last week in my new games
book. Thanks to Lawren for thinking "hands on your knees" when I ran
out of appropriate verses.</p>

<p class=date>8:56am</p>

<p>"Marta is awesome, that will get you started," says Marta, to get
me started.</p>

<p>But what I was really going to say is that Senna and I
got to be a vocal musical instrument (drums) for Joan to play.  She designated
a sound for us to make when she tapped our shoulders or head.  Mine
were "pitterpatter" "boink" and "wheeee!"  Senna's were "doobeedoo"
"tssssh" (high hat) and "tickytacky"  Fun stuff!</p>

<p>Workshops now.</p>

<p class=date>11:32am</p>

<p>Creative writing workshop with Meg.  My image had a house with
wacked out bricks and an apple tree and a guy pushing a lawnmower on
top of an 18 wheeler, plus the wind blowing.</p>

<p>Then games in our touchgroup: name game with animals and pizza
toppings then an instrument game like during breakfast.</p>

<p>Then a rousing game of detective and suddenly Noah came running up
as if chased by a demon.  Busted open the door and with all
seriousness of a train wreck, "ultimate frisbee."</p>

<p>We all ran out of the cabin.</p>

<p class=date>12:19pm</p>

<p>Yay for no injuries during Ultimate!  We were smart twice this year
and (1) no people were picked last thanks to Sean splitting up six
people.  (2) played 7 players on the line (it was Jack's idea) which
gave us three subs per team and a lots more rest, safer play and all
that.</p>

<p>The teams were rather evenly picked and we had about the same score
at the end of the game.  Both teams were consistently scoring uphill.</p>
