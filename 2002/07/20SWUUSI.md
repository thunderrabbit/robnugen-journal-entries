<p>Hmm, so, EMacs, interesting, I've never used this. (This is Ben by
the way) I'm all about the BBEdit wit da GUI. I don't do command line,
at least, not offten anyways. Oh well. Rob, you need more games. Go
download EV:Nova from <a href="https://wwww.ambrosiasw.com">Ambrosia
Software</a>. It's fun. Buh-bye.</p>

<p class=date>11:21pm</p>

<p>Sally, Ryan, Lisa, Calder, Laura playing Egyptian Rat Screw.</p>

<p>I introduced Sally around to peeps as she was sitting on the side
to start the evening.</p>

<p class=date>12:42am Sunday 21 July 2002</p>

<p>Have just labeled 30 some odd pictures with Ben and Phat Pat's
help.</p>

<p class=date>1:55am</p>

<p>Lisa, Sally, Damien, Ryan playing dominoes.  Lisa doesn't know the
rules and thinks Ryan and Damien are making them up as they go.</p>

<p>Other discussions happening randomly: Rick Bibby, Susie, Ann,
Debbie (advisor clique)</p>

<p>Adam and Colleen with Colleen on her improv bed on a picnic table</p>

<p>Annie asleep on her picnic table bed..</p>

<p>Kelly, do you have anything to say for the journal?  "No, not
really, but SWUUSI better kick ass, and if it doesn't then I'll make
it cause it's my last SWUUSI.  And stuff.  I'm so close to sleep.
Like so I can stay awake tomorrow night.  But I don't have a pillow.
But I need sleep.</p>

<p>"Am I still talking like a decent human being?  Cause I'm not
making any sense to myself.  One thing you should never do before
SWUUSI is go to Jim's and have six cups of coffee.</p>

<p>"[something about a bear]  goodnight Rob."</p>

<p class=date>3:18am</p>

<p>Super funniness in the kitchen with old schoolers Adam, Scottie,
Elizabeth tossing insults back and forth with Bryn, Erica, Jackie (I
think)</p>

<p>Goodnight now for real.</p>
