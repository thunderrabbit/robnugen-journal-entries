<p>At Kinko's now, with other peeps, all vying for phone and ethernet
connections.  There's a girl here who's applying for lawschools in New
York and Los Angeles.  I saw her here a couple nights ago.</p>

<p>She let me use her phone line; I gave her a yellow adventure card.</p>

<p>Her name is Monica.</p>
