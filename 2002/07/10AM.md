<p class=date>9:55am CDT Wednesday 10 July 2002</p>

<p>My day begins again at Kinko's, as it seems to do now lately.
Interesting to think this place is just hoppin with activity 24 hours
per day.  People doing all sorts of stuff from creating movies, to
political advertising, multi-level business building, free internet
mooching..</p>

<p>Have munched lunch with Dude at Mission Burrito; $2 off Que Mas
salad on Tuesdays in July.  Awww yeah.</p>
