<p>I have just created two flyers advertising the contents of my
apartment, including color pics of my futon and chest of drawers.
This is a bit unnerving to me - is my price set well?  Is it worth the
cost of making color copies?  How many copies do I need?  Where are
the best places to put them?</p>

<p>Eeeek!</p>

<p>I mean, thank you Kinko's and universe for making this process
simple for me.</p>
