A big HELLO from Canada Rob!  Likely you will only have the faintest memory of losing the shirt off
your back to some crazy Canadian &amp; friends at a PB Party in a hot basement in Tokyo in May
'05. Again, thanks for being a good sport!  You will be amused to know that your shirt resides in
Thunder Bay Ontario Canada at the bottom of my brothers drawer (in the threezee photo Dan is to your
right....he has an affinity to monkey shirts).  I have attached a few photos of that fateful
encounter to jog your memory.  We had an absolute blast during that 10 day haze, managing to tour
Tokyo, climb Mount Fujisan, spent time in Nagoya at World Expo as well as in Kyoto.

Steven, the guy you actually traded your monkey shirt with, still lives in Tokyo...

All of the folks in the PB group photo attached, including the cardboard heads, have continued to be
involved in Rotary International Projects promoting goodwill, peace and understanding around the
world. We are big into the Rotary Group Study Exchange Program, which is a cultural/vocational
exchange that pairs teams of 5 from different countries on an annual basis.  We went on one
ourselves to Sweden in 2000, had a fabulous life changing experience, and now facilitate the same
program for others.  The camaraderie this generates between nationalities is truly phenomenal...and
connection by connection we feel it makes the world a better place to live.

It is always GREAT to hear of your many adventures Rob and your updates are delightful!  Please
accept this email as my official request to stay on the "Rob Update List" for 100 years.  Hope your
movie night at the Pink Cow was a success.  Best of luck with your passion for the arts and your
foray into meditation!  Keep us posted on your showing in July...you never know what will inspire us
to return to Tokyo!

Peace &amp; Goodwill from Canada!

Jill
