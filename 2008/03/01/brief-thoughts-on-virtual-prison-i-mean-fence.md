['Virtual Fence' Along Border To Be Delayed - washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/27/AR2008022703747.html) 
 

> Boeing has already been paid $20.6 million for the pilot project, and in December, the DHS gave the firm another $65 million to replace the software with military-style, battle management software.



This, for some reason, seems shocking to me.  Okay, so this is for a virtual fence 28 miles long.  The $20.6 million price works out to almost [$140 / foot](http://www.google.com/search?q=20.6+million+dollars+%2F+28+miles+in+dollars+%2F+foot).

The price paid to Boeing to fix their own mistake I _assume_ can be amortized out along the rest of the 100 miles estimated to be completed by 2011, or, three years late.  But let's just further grant that it can be amortized along the entire 2000 miles, so the software costs [$6 / foot](http://www.google.com/search?q=65+million+dollars+%2F+2000+miles+in+dollars%2Ffoot+%3D).  Hmm; that's not so bad.

So let's just hope Boeing finishes the rest of the project on (the new delayed) schedule, and on (the new increased) butdget, and generally gets everything right.

BWHAHAhaahahahahaa!!!  What am I saying???

Read the latest [News: virtual fence us.mexico](http://news.google.com/news?q=virtual+fence+us.mexico).

AND, let me be the first to point out: If it works, THIS IS ALSO A VIRTUAL PRISON for US Americans.  Get out while you can.
