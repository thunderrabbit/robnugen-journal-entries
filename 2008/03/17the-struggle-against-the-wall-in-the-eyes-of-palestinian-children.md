[Save Jerusalem from the Apartheid Wall and Ethnic cleansing](http://www.thehandstand.org/archive/may2006/articles/jerusalemwall.htm)



> In an attempt to disrupt this unity among Palestinians on both sides of the Armistice Line, the Wall has been built right down the middle of the village, separating families and neighbors, shopkeepers and customers from their markets, people from their work, and children from their schools. 216 shops and houses have been demolished close to where the Wall has been built. 600 out of the previously existing 1,200 shops had to close.
