[Family holidays ruined by earliest Easter in 90 years](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=540511&in_page_id=1770)


> It was felt that to celebrate Christ's resurrection on the wrong day would be blasphemous so it was very important to get the day right. The general rule was agreed at the Council of Nicea in 325 AD.


hahahahahahaaaha!!!

This cracks me up.  The idea that God / Jesus / anyone-who's-enlightened would be displeased/upset/blasphemised if a celebration were held at the wrong time..

Or even not held at all...  no big deal!

hahahahahahahahahaha!!!

Who cares about Easter anyway?  Kids!  Eggs!  Families!  Is there a wrong day for families to celebrate their lives?  Are the eggs fresher in late March than in mid April?  Is it better for kids to chase eggs when the weather is cold?

Spring hasn't even sprung here in Tokyo.  Good thing we don't have Easter!!!
