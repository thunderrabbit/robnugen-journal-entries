> The bombardment near the Arab Jabour area on the southern outskirts of Baghdad is part of a new countrywide push against insurgents called Operation Phantom Phoenix,...

The official said the area is one of the last insurgent "safe havens" in the agricultural region that includes sprawling fields and farmlands.


I'm sure if it includes farmlands, it includes farm houses and innocent Iraqis.

What a fuckin' nightmare to destroy more of the country than they have already.Â  I'm sure this is resulting in less than "diminishing returns," but in negative returns: more hatred toward the US, loss of any remaining respect in the world, and a waste of money to boot.

And by "waste of money," I mean funneling money into pockets of war profiteers.  Stop it stop it stop it.
