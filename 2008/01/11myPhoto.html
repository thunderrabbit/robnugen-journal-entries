HI Michael

I'd like to evaluate myPhoto; it seems *reeeally* close to what I want
(I'll FTP the results to my site).  I did the initial installation and
it set up my website (with basically an empty album). However, I was
uable to open the preference pane (Picture 13 attached)

I'm running OS X 10.4.11 on MacBook with Intel chip.  I doubt it
matters, but my iPhoto is version 6.06

I tried to register for your forum to post there, but I got a message
that said certain aspects of my registration look like I am a spammer.
 (Picture 15 attached)

I'm not a spammer.   (but that's what a spammer would say..  hmmmmm ;-)
I imagine it's because of my choice of email address.  I own
robnugen.com and my way of tracking spammers (whom I hate as much as
you) is to use the domain for which I'm registering as the username of
my email address.

If you have thoughts on how to resolve the preference pane issue, or
registering for your site, please let me know.  :-)

  - Rob!

<p>ooooh!  A much longer reply!</p>

Rob,

Glad to hear myPhoto looks like what you need. The issue you
encountered is due to my longstanding neglect to actually post an
update. I've attached an updated version of myPhotoPrefs to this email
which is recompiled to include Intel support. I expect that this
should do the trick for you.

Also, sorry about the forum thing. For a period, they were so
aggressive with my forums that I would get about 20 or so fake users a
day covering the entire site with fairly explicit, out there porn--not
quite the image I was going for. ;-) I tried implementing something of
a home-made solution to harden the forums, which has mostly worked,
but like you've seen, isn't quite perfect (and occasionally an odd
spammer will get through, get a post or two in, and then get banned
automatically). If you'd like, I could register you an account and
send you the details, although honestly, its been pretty quiet on there.

Anyways, I hope this helps and thanks for trying myPhoto!



                            -Mike

<p>I'm hesitant to be crazy enthusiastic (I've been <del>working on</del> <ins>wanting</ins> a
solution to this for a long time, BUT, this is the current state of my reply:</p>

Hey Mike

Wow thanks for a fast and full-bodied reply; I have been getting less than such from other iPhoto to
website code writers, but I know everyone is in various states of busy-ness, and most questions on
forums tend to be from users who haven't yet RTFM.

I am happy to report that the preference pane did install.  Right now it is "Searching hard drive
for all libraries... ..."

While I'm waiting, if you don't mind, I have a couple of questions, in order from chit-chat to
problems on this end:

1) What kind of home-grown spam blocking solution did you write for phpBB forum?  I've never used
phpBB for my own stuff (basically cause I haven't released any software that's become popular), but
I've seen it around.  Did you release your changes to the phpBB forum's forum?

2) Have you considered releasing your myPhoto code as open source?  I have started to do that for
all my code, using either GPL or Perl license or freeware.  Haven't used any of the Creative Commons
licenses for code, but for my other writings.

3) How long do you think it should take for the preference pane to search for libraries?  It's still
not done yet, and it started before I started this email, including all the stuff before the
following period.  I don't hear the HD running, and I'm pretty sure the initial install I mentioned
yesterday didn't take this long to find the library (located in the normal location I believe):
~/Pictures/iPhoto Library

When I first opened the pane, it didn't show any libraries, so I clicked Find all (on the right hand
side) and it found nothing.

IMPORTANT (AND HAPPY) UPDATE!!

Cancel question 3 above!  I just realized I should probably try clicking Find all sites (on the left
hand side) as well, and it found everything instantly!!

Before finding myPhoto, I decided to write my own using Xtools and Cocoa, which I imagine you've
used for myPhoto.  I got started with the tutorial
(<a href="/journal.pl?type=all&date=2008/01/10#cocoa">http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=all&date=2008/01/10#cocoa</a>), but didn't get very far.

4) Is the problem with the intel preference pane just due to the RHS button not being associated
with the same code as the LHS button?

If you send me an updated preference pane, I think I can make and reply with a DMG that includes it
(unless we need to keep the old version as well, in which case the background image should be
changed a bit to indicate the differences between the versions).  Or release two versions of the
DMG.

<p>But I haven't clicked the iPhoto Assistant button yet.  If it works, ... man..  I don't know what I'll do.</p>

5) OMG can I have your babies?????  It's working!!!!!

Okay okay okay...  it's 3:51am here in Tokyo; I'm going to send this email and email you again later
once I can think a bit more clearly.  I have found some issues (so you can just cancel that offer to
have your babies), but I am reallllly impressed with what you've got; I'll definitely be pimping <a href="http://agent0068.dyndns.org/~mike/projects/myPhoto/">myPhoto</a>!
