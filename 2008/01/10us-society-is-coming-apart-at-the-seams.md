> Whether it is the loss of a decent job, impossible conditions at work, rising prices, the threat of foreclosure or bankruptcy, the promise of endless war in Iraq and elsewhere, crumbling infrastructure, the elimination or slashing of social services and programsâ€”US society is coming apart at the seams. None of the presidential candidates of the two big business parties is either willing or able to address these burning problems.

I've been thinking this for most of the time I've been in Japan; it's one reason I've not wanted to go back. Usually I just say I don't want to support a government that's trying to kill the world. But that it's killing its own citizens is equally good reason not to go back. Killing in terms of letting Katrina victims die; crappy health care system; crappy education system; crappy use of energy; crappy etc.
