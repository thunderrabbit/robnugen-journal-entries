Hey cutie!!

I just told Ami the sleep-first story yesterday and she was like, " " and I was like, "don't you get
it???  It was so much fun!!"

What time is it in Pu-th, the most remotest capital in the world?

It's 7am in Tokyooo; I've been up all night, most recently watching http://zeitgeistmovie.com which
is pretty depressing until the very last 2 minutes, but well well worth a watch!

I am doing well in Japan, and before I amble off to bed, I want to relay an interesting thought that
one of my mates here pointed out.

If, for example, I moved from Texas (yee haw!) to New York, my parents wouldn't say, "so, when are
you going to move back to Texas???"  Or if I had moved from Houston to Austin, no one would be like,
"hey man, when are you going to move back to Houston?"  But for some reason, when we change
*countries*, people expect we'll be right back!

SO, I will quit asking you "when are you going to move back to Japan???" and just love you as my
dear friend Jen no matter where you live and no matter how many days pass between emails.  You take
care of yourself and I will do the same..  I will *also* always treasure our lovely times playing
with scads of cash and giggling with uproarious laughter and taking videos instead of photos and
counseling each other on love and life and Michael Jackson and karaoke and Dirty Wog and great
bicycles and swimming with Dan and No Pants Shoko Shoko and chillin' by ghetto river to play silent
footie and chillin' like movie stars in our ghetto yard with branchless climbing trees and all the
hilarity we enjoyed together.

Thank you for being special in my life.

     Love Love Love
   - Rob!  Rob!  ROB!!
