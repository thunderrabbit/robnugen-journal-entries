<p>Oh noes!!  For the past *many* mornings, I've always purchased a 1.5 liter bottle of orange
juice from the nearby convenience store.  Yesterday, I bought the last one they had in stock.  I
assumed they would get more...</p>

<p>BUT, today there wasn't even a spot for my beloved OJ bottles.</p>

<p>Now, it's quite common for products to be shuffled around, so it could come back soon, but
somehow I doubt it.   Gah.</p>

<p>So today I bought a two liter bottle of water, which I'll be refilling with water for the
forseeable future.</p>

<p>ps: with all those bottles, I decided I would make a chair like the ones <a href="http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=all&date=2006/02/08#Day_in_Rio">Rei and I enjoyed in
Rio de Janerio</a>.</p>
