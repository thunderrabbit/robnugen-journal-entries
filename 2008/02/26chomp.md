[Hammerhead Shark Diving by Shark Diver](https://www.divediscovery.com/grouptrips/grouptrips12.shtml)   


> To insure[sic] the best results we will be “chumming” the water with fish and fish parts. Consequently, there will be food in the water while divers are in the water. To insure your safety, we will usually have one or two crewmembers in the water as safety. Please be aware that these are NOT “cage” dives, they are open water experiences.



I wonder if they'll be leaving this quote on their site... I wonder if they'll still chum the water...  I hope they'll stay in business!
