Dear Mr. Nugen:

Thank you for contacting me about the United States' policy toward Israel. I appreciate having the
benefit of your comments on this matter.

In a region characterized by instability and violence, Israel stands alone in its commitment to
democracy, free-market principles, and individual liberties. The strong cultural, religious, and
political ties shared by the United States and Israel form a bond between our countries that should
never be broken.

As you know, Hezbollah and Hamas are terrorist organizations that refuse to recognize Israel's right
to exist and call for its destruction. Furthermore, these terrorist organizations have repeatedly
attacked Israel, killing innocent civilians. These attacks underscore the fact that we must continue
to confront terror in every quarter. The United States joins with Israel in fighting the War on
Terror, and we remain resolute in pursuing our joint goals. It is critical that the Palestinian
Authority leadership also act decisively to end terrorism.

Since its founding in 1948, Israel has been a strong, faithful ally to the United States in the
Middle East. This strategic partnership is important for both countries. U.S. policy toward Israel
should reflect the mutual interests and security goals of both nations, and I will continue to
support such a policy. It is my hope that we can end the scourge of terrorism and usher in a new
chapter in the peace process.

I appreciate having the opportunity to represent the interests of Texans in the United States
Senate. Thank you for taking the time to contact me.

Sincerely,

JOHN CORNYN

<p>At first I was going to reply, &quot;What are you saying????  Israel is NOT committed to
democracy....&quot; and rant on from there, but I think I can produce a bit of a nicer response.</p>
