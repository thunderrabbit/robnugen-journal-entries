[ScribeFire :: Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1730)   


> ScribeFire (previously Performancing for Firefox) is a full-featured blog editor that integrates with your browser and lets you easily post to your blog. You can drag and drop formatted text from pages you are browsing, take notes, and post to your blog.  


  
This feature is something that I wanted to pluck from Flock and move to FF. Now it seems that I can.  
  
AND, the interface for ScribeFire is way smoother than the one on Flock. (e.g. just enter the blog URL and it determines the type and the api entry point; e.g. start a blog entry and *then* setup the u/p to the blog)
