> Gravia is an LED-lit floorlamp energized by people. To light Gravia, the user places a mass approximately 48" above the ground, that, in falling, powers a mechanism, generating electricity. Gravia harnesses the potential energy imparted by the user, rather than relying on any existing electrical infrastructure.  


  
  
This is a must have item. Too bad it doesn't seem to be for sale yet!  
  
I'd like to have a version that's as easy to use as an hour glass. Just flip it over and light pours out!
