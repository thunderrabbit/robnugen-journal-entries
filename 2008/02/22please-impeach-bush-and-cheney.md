[Maverick Republican Drops WC Bomb on Bush/Cheney](http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_dan_dewa_080220_maverick_republican_.htm) 
 

> After passing out copies of the second chapter of Patrick Buchanan's "Day of Reckoning"- as supporting evidence, Vaillancourt opened his remarks quoting "fools rush in where wise men fear to tread"-, and it sounded like a set up to condemn a rush to impeach. But instead he said that Betty Hall is neither fool nor wise man, but is a model of courage and that her impeachment resolution should be supported. 



Thank God for people in higher and higher positions of political power vocalizing that the GW Bush years have been nothing but a nightmare worthy of im<del>peach</del>prisonment.
