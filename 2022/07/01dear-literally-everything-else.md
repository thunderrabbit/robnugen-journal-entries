Dear Literally Everything "else" in the world, from the sound of keys
clicking to the memory of an ant walking, to the curve of blue fabric
on my pillow and the warmth generated by the sun.  THANK YOU for yet
another beautiful lovely day.

Great to brainstorm ideas for how to improve the value of my barefoot
walking events.  Thank You as Misa for many great ideas to improve the
value of my events, increasing my capacity to shine Your Light into
the world.

Thank You as Jimmy for loving and supporting me even while physically
distant.  Thank You for all the love and support You offer.

Thank You as Lin for courageously quitting the job which no longer
serves You as her.  I'm so proud of You as Lin's growth and moving
ever toward Your Light.  I am safe and loving, sharing Your infinite abundance.
