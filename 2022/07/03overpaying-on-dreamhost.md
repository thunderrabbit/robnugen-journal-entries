Hmm!  Interesting that I have just discovered I've been paying
Dreamhost for a private MySQL server since January 2020.

$58 / month.   Hmmm.

January 2020 - December 2020 = 12 months
January 2021 - December 2021 = 12 months
January 2022 - July 2022 = 7 months

So, hopefully I can get (12 + 12 + 7) * 58 dollars credit, or even a
check, but for simplicity, I prefer the credit.
