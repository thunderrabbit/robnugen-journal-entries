So weird..  After applying for Visual Alpha, I decided to start
playing with node.js and couldn't spin up a basic VM with
Vagrant. Hmmm.

I logged out of a Vagrant box that is right now running on my host,
but Vagrant app says it's not running.

Hmmm.

I wiped ALL the Vagrant volumes from my computer but still couldn't
spin up anything.

I uninstalled + reinstalled Vagrant but no luck.

I'm gonna reboot my machine now
