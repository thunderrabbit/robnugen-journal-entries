<p class='dream'>We were listening to a lecturer in a big common room and people were studying as a big nice brown Labrador retriever type dog that had been there during the week came up to me as dogs do and I just started petting him and loving on him and he put his head down on my belly or legs and we were just in sync as I was petting him and he was like loving on me and someone asked if it was my dog and I not quite jokingly said "no but if his owner doesn't show up soon I will take him home." The woman said "I don't think he has an owner" and I thought then I would enjoy having a dog and wondering if I could take care of him, and yet knowing that I could. I would pet his torso and feel the breath of his body on my face as he basically fell asleep on me and I fell asleep as well. My legs fell over and bumped a woman who was studying about how to make whipped cream and I apologize for having bumped her with my legs and she said "oh no problem" because she had been studying hard and maybe time to take a break herself so she got up and walked over toward the kitchen and went inside her room with people preparing food. It was near the end of the multi day event where different people have been learning and practicing different things learning how to do cooking and make some whipped cream and I overheard her talking about how the tips of whipped cream had to be a certain way and how the bottom of the whipped cream trough works and she was teaching her friend what terminology to use when describing how the whipped cream boats weren't doing the right thing.  She was sharing her knowledge and then I saw someone else saying she had sore arms and I asked if she'd been making whipped cream by hand and she said she had been learning how to row and I asked if she would like some reiki and she said "oh yes! what is it?" so I started to do reiki on her arms as we were looking out over the balcony looking at some kind of performance in the courtyard as people were performing their talents in the last day or so of this workshop.  The guy next to me was saying "wow just for a second I realized we would have to go back into the other world (matrix)" and I said "it's so nice to be here in the sane world" and we were reflecting on the choice of being in this energy where everyone makes sense and supports each other and I felt so great to be here in this world and then after I finished reiki for the girl she turned around and gave me a single kiss on the lips and then I hugged her and I said "I love you" even though we had just met and she said I love you back and then she said she couldn't remember if she had said it to me before and in what language and someone tried to hug me from behind and she kind of pulled me away from him like saying she had not finished her hug and she was a little bit shy to say I love you and when I turned around it was another friend I had met, a young black man with short hair, and I said oh hey man as I couldn't remember his name though I thought it was Thomas and I gave him a hug as music started to come on and was about to do a bass drop and I said "oh let's show them let's show them" and we started to incredibly dance of deep bass dance like very low to the ground and bouncing off the ground on our butts and the backs of our bodies and even bouncing off the ground face down and incredible motion to the music and everybody was kind of watching as we were able to bounce off the ground and bouncing off of each other while upside down and using the music as fodder for our dance and then the music stopped and I bounced back up with him after finished dancing with him then hugged again, so we had had just done an entire dance within our single big hug and I said "now that's a hug!" and was so entertained I had just called that the whole thing one hug feeling so great. I woke up laughing and so happy.</p>
