I know my images are too large as they are sent.  I tried effing with
code on b.robnugen.com to shrink them according to the size of the
browser, but never really solved the issue.

Right now according to this site / page, the top page of my site is
2.77MB

https://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.robnugen.com/Ex2jEHuW/

1.87MB worth of images and 0.72MB worth of JS.  Hmm not great, and I
am sure I can do better, at least on the images, and probably on the
JS.  TBH I don't know what JS is being used on my site. If I added it,
I don't recall.
