      "content": "So today I woke up around I guess 9:15 and then did meditation for a while using my meditation timer and also Sadhguru's timer [Miracle Of Mind](https://miracleofmind.sng.link/Aoy32/pnp0/r_124ae2a7e8)\n\nAfter having read Kevin's book, [The Secret Fire of Alchemy](https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Fire-Alchemy-Kundalini-Shamanism/dp/B0CY9LKM98), I've been doing meditation more consistently, often going well beyond the 21 minute maximum within Sadhguru's app.\n\nSo I'm glad I have created my own meditation timer, Meiso Gambare at \nhttps://mg.robnugen.com/mg/3PVtypU2rqW\n\n#### 10:37 am\n\nI'm currently standing outside with about 50 to-do list items floating in my head after getting stuck on the link above: \n\nThings to do (sometime in the mysterious future) \n\n1. Tell my phone that when I type `mg` It should expand that out into `https://mg.robnugen.com/`\n2. Make the unique link to my meditation (above) public.\nWhen that's done it should show basically what's in this image:\nhttps://b.robnugen.com/journal/2026/2026_feb_06_meditated_for_50_minutes_1000.png\n\n3. ✅ Upload the above image that's currently just a screenshot on my phone showing 40:27 with a green background\n4. ✅ Mention that means I meditated for 50 minutes because I started with 10 minutes for my countdown timer and it then counted up 40 minutes and 27 seconds.\n5. Pray 🙏, writing in BOOK TWENTY-NINE page ??\n8. Fill in the page numbers in my journal.\n6. Invite people to my emotional awareness workshop and book launch party\n7. Fix the link to my upcoming barefoot grounding event. I think it's broken because the title must be unique.\n9. Copy this entry from my phone into my journal parsing LLM, Gemini via Google Antigravity \n10. Message Jess\n11. Call Yuki\n\n#### 11:04\n\nWhile standing outside in the sun, writing this journal entry, I saw my neighbor with her new old rescue dog, とろろ\nhttps://b.robnugen.com/journal/2026/2026_feb_06_neighbors_dog_tororo_1000.jpeg\n\n#### 11:09\n\nIt's 11:09 a.m. now I'm going to finish writing on my phone and start doing some of the tasks above that are not yet done.",
