12:15 a.m. 4 October 1992 Today Heather and I studied at her house all morning and a lot of the afternoon I got a lot done. She sewed her suit that she will wear to three interviews next week. Amazing.  While at her house I slept for 45 minutes. She woke me up and I held my hand up so she could help me up. I pulled her down instead just to see what she would do. She kind of quickly nibble/bit me in the side. Ooh, very nice. I hugged her and then got up.

After studying, I met ma at my house and we went to the UH football game at Rice against USL University of Southwest Louisiana. We left after the halftime show so we could see Fred perform. Cool. Mikah (sp) hey dude, who volunteered in the pharmacy is a cheerleader. Very cool. I watched (in awe) as he popped a girl into this position.

Then ma and I came home and discussed what she will do with her furniture. Now I'm going to bed.
