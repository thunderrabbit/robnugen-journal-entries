This may just be some nicely written copy, but I have a feeling that Meteor will be a game changer for the web.

================================================

We're happy to announce that we've arranged $11.2 million in funding
for Meteor's continued development. The money is now sitting in the
bank account of Meteor Development Group, a company controlled by the
project founders.

$11.2 million is a lot of money. What it gives us is certainty. No
matter what else happens in the world, the core team will be able to
focus entirely on Meteor for several years, without taking on
consulting work or trying to create some other application on top of
Meteor to sell. The high valuation of the round eliminates any
possiblity of a talent acquisition. And we control the company's
board. So, everyone in the community can be certain that Meteor will
be around for the long haul.

Our agenda for the next few years is as follows:

1. Make Meteor the best platform for writing most any kind of
app. This is an enormous job and will continue to consume almost all
of our energy. Our goal is ubiquity on the scale of SQL, Apache, or
Java.

2. Create opportunities for Meteor developers -- for example,
encourage companies to adopt Meteor, creating jobs. We want to make
you famous and get you paid.

3. Support the Meteor community. This includes everything from
publishing books and organizing conferences, to being responsive to
bug reports and pull requests, to finally making some cool tshirts.

Meteor will always be free and open-source. Eventually, we plan to
make a commercial product too, called Galaxy. Galaxy will be a product
that the operations department at a large company might buy. It'll be
an enterprise-grade, multi-tenant hosting environment for Meteor
apps. In other words, it'll let you run a private, centrally
controlled "meteor deploy"-like service for your company, on your own
hardware. You'll be able to manage how your apps are distributed
across your datacenters, perform capacity planning, and enforce
controls and policies that are appropriate to your
organization. Google and Facebook have these tools -- why shouldn't
your organization? If your company is not large enough to have an
operations department, it's unlikely that you'd want to buy Galaxy.

Galaxy is a long distance in the future. For now, the only focus is Meteor.

With this money comes a lot of responsibility. When we started this
project, we took on two jobs -- building a great application platform,
and building a fun, welcoming, and supportive community around it. Now
we're taking on a third job, building a world-class company. This is
not an easy job, and we already have our hands full with jobs one and
two. Fortunately we've recruited some excellent help.

* Top VC fund Andreessen Horowitz is putting up most of the money. We
chose AH because everyone we met at AH was staggeringly intelligent,
and many of them have built highly impactful companies such as
Netscape. AH also has strong name recognition among CTO's and CIO's,
which will make it easier to sell your boss on Meteor.

* Meteor's partner at AH is Peter Levine. As former CEO of XenSource,
he is an expert at selling open source into the enterprise. AH has
kindly allowed their board seat to be occupied by Rod Johnson, who
created the open source Spring framework and built a successful
company (SpringSource) around it. And we also found a way to involve
David Skok at Matrix Ventures, who built the enterprise sales
strategy for JBoss, the open-source application server. Peter, Rod,
and David are our dream team and we're very fortunate to have gotten
them all into the same room.

* The wise and patient counsel of James Lindenbaum (Heroku) has
already been invaluable. Besides James, other individual investors
include Dustin Moskovitz (Facebook/Asana), Alexis Ohanian (Reddit),
Paul Buchheit (Gmail), Maynard Webb, Ron Conway, and others.

* Meteor was also a stealth participant in the S11 cycle of Y Combinator.

Deals like these have a lot of moving parts and take a long time to
close. It's a relief to make this announcement and get back to
coding. We'll have more news over the coming weeks.
