Josh and Amy are two of Lin's friends from work; they started around the same time as she did, so they're all mates. We all went to The Pink Cow last night, for Josh's and Amy's first and first visits, respectfully.

 

It was Body Works Night, featuring live painting, live body painting, about eight belly dancers, three Cuban dancers, and live music.

 

The Cuban dancing was new to me, and the most interesting, with bright blue and bright burnt orange flowy puffy dresses, plus a guy half naked and sweeping the air and his back with a broom made of thin sticks.

 

Delicious burritos and goldrush brownies and extra ice cream. Great to see Traci, and excited to hear that The Pink Cow is moving to Roppongi soonishly! They'll certainly get more walk-in traffic who will enjoy the delights of The Pink Cow!!!
