##14:39 Monday 09 July 2012

 
  1. I really appreciate that posterous makes it easy to post text and images to my wordpress installation on my website robnugen.com, and my accounts on facebook.com, posterous.com, plus a link on twitter.   
But I don't really like not have tighter control of the HTML/CSS used to create entries.
 
  2. Lin and I have been married for a year and 8 days. It's been quite lovely, and opposite one of the comics at the recent Mad Cows Comedy at The Pink Cow (which is moving to Roppongi soon), I *do* wake up each morning going, "yes!! I married Lin!"
 
  3. No kids on the radar, but there have been discussions and a certain lack of protection in that arena. In my dream I heard "first ejaculation is conception," which I don't know how well was translated on the way to my brain, but that's what I heard.
 
  4. I'm at work at sbstrm, now on my third year-contract over a four year period.
 
  5. Francois, having had a shower and a couple years of adventures, is back on my desk.
 
  6. My new MacBook Pro will arrive next week! It's got 16GB of RAM, 512GB of SSD (my first SSD machine (*)), plus the latest CPU and screen ("retina display").  
(*) Fred says it will be by far the largest jump in speed I've ever gotten by upgrading my computer.
 
  7. We had a decent little shakey earthquake last week, but it's forgettable in the larger scale (as are all things; hmmm)
 
  8. My dad called me on skype from his iPhone. That's cool, and it's even cooler that he was out and about (I assume not near a wifi connection). What's not cool is that he was driving at the time! DAaaaaAADD!!
 
  9. Tariq and I are working on the app yomikakieigo (read and write English); our first attempt at releasing it in the app store was rejected for it being "primarily a video" If by "a video" they meant "11 videos," I can understand. Anyway, we're making a sorta-game out of it with the videos as unlockable rewards. I'm sure that will allay any concerns that it's primarily a video.
 
  10. We're also working on an app that uses Cocos2D. I think it will be fun even though it won't have any videos.
 
  11. I put together some code that will essentially do what CakePHP's framework functionality does: read the DB table info and make the basic code to read and write records from the DB. It even includes some ajax to prevent creating same-named records.
 
  12. Recently been working on a popup window that talks to the datatables table in the main window, allowing filtering on any field in the primary and a secondary table. haven't added the second secondary table or the two tertiary tables, but that's all coming.
 
  13. I've been reading [_The Hiram Key_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057DBFQI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0057DBFQI&linkCode=as2&tag=keepusthelim-20)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=keepusthelim-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0057DBFQI) by Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas. It's pretty interesting to look at what more likely happened back in the day of Jesus (and back in the day before that). I had already heard that Christianity was made mainstream by [Council of Nicaea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea), but this gives even more detail. 
 
  14. AB is the nickname for the client that Lin got for us; I am pretty much in charge of their project so that's fun.
