HI Apple

 

I was looking forward to getting support on my new MBP, but when I tried to log in to one-to-one on Firefox, I get the message that I must use Safari.

 

 

Is there a workaround for this?  Is Apple only targeting Firefox?  I can open the same link in Chrome, but how long until you block Chrome as well?

 

 

It seems like Apple is trying to boost Safari market share with some freedom-revoking business practice.

I feel really sad to have to cancel, but I think it's the only way I can get Apple's attention.  Can you please pass along the message?

 

 

best regards

I sent the above message to my contact at the Apple Store in Shibuya. After reading the pros and cons of one-to-one membership, I had been sold on the idea that I could get an outstanding amount of help in a year for just $99. The message was basically sitting down with an _expert_ on OS X would be invaluable. Even just a single session to help get my new Mac tweaked would be worth the price. Fair enough; I tacked on 9500 yen to my ~300,000 yen purchase. One-to-one for a small fraction of the overall price; why not?

 

 

I routinely switch between Chrome and Firefox in my web browsing and web development. I have Safari (and Rockmelt, and Flock) in my Dock, but I don't ever open them; I don't remember the details, but they didn't suit me for one reason or another.

 

 

Being forced to use Safari will not make me happy to use it.

When Windows 98 came out, I said "screw this" and switched to Red Hat linux. I never got into it enough to figure out how to upgrade the kernel, so when OS X came out, I switched to Mac and was quite happy with my choice.

 

 

I'm getting to a "screw this" mentality with Apple now. I think I'll be looking at ubuntu next.
