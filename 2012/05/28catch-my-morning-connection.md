Sweet!  I stepped barefootedly onto the Tokaido line and saw Michael Q Todd standing right there!  [http://xeeme.com/michaelqtodd](http://xeeme.com/michaelqtodd)

He's just back from 14 months on The Gold Coast of OZ, and will be finishing his new book soon after doing a speaking tour overseas. 

We were both headed to Shinagawa, and I detected some free time in his schedule so suggested he get a hug from AMMA, right across the street from the station. 

He said he wasn't surprised at all the synchronicities; I'm reading A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle, one of the three books Michael owns: "there's a big shift in consciousness that's been accelerating in the past few months."

He gave me the idea of Abundance Marketing: do what you love and promote all the people close to your niche who have good products.
