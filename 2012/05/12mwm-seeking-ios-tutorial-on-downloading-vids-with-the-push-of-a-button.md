I had some quick and easy success with the first two cocos2d tutorials at [http://www.raywenderlich.com/tutorials](http://www.raywenderlich.com/tutorials) but now I'm having a hard time finding a clear tutorial on how to download a video from a remote server and play it on iPhone.

 

The searches seem to be polluted with videos about downloading apps, but that's not what I want.  Even stackoverflow seems to be relatively silent on this issue.  sigh.

 

When I first started reading Peanuts cartoons, I pronounced "sigh" as "sig"
