I tried posting all 24 solar eclipse pics at once and the posterous iphone app crashed.  Okay, not good, but fair enough: out of memory and crashed.  Fine; I get it. 

But, before crashing, the app sends to posterous server, "hey I'm about to send you some data for Rob's journal!  Here it comes!" and then the app crashes and the server is like, okay I got it!  And posts the empty entry. 

Gah.   Dear Posterous Server, if you don't get the "I'm finished" and "please publish" signals, the post is not ready to post.
