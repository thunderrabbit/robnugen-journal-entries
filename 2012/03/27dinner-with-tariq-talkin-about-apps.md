Tariq came over to chat with me about some app ideas he has. Even more fun than that was hearing him and Lin talk about working at Gaba back in the day; they know a lot of the same people though they didn't know each other at the time.

 

And, Lin made yummy veggie stew and potato salad for us!

 

We'll hopefully hang out a bit more often now that we both live in Kawasaki. Of course a bit more often could mean once per year..

 

I'm optimistic we can get some apps out by the end of this year. (before the world ends)

 

Right now I'm downloading XCode 4.2, which I think is the latest version I can use on OS X 10.6.8.
