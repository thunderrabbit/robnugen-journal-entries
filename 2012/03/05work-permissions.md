Today at work I fixed a bug, thankfully found a worse bug before putting the  
fix online, and did some semi-new development regarding building fine grained user permissions on their website.

The new system allows unlimited permission groups which the code can check before displaying a given page.  With a bit more coding (and another table), I can allow them to actually specify exactly which directories a user is allowed to access.  But for now I'm going to leave that out of the system unless they ask for its equivalent or until the permission requirement changes get too frequent for me to happily change them each time.
