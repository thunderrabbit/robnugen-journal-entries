Played Change today at Artists Way class. The game is a specialty of Soness's and I was playing quietly at first until she challenged me and I just let go and jumped over tables, rode her skateboard to the wolf's demise and had a nice reconnection with the energy of me, Fred, Peter, and Katie back when we had a VHS recorder and an apartment to ourselves. 

Even pulled in some of the old voices of Pete's characters. 

Good times and glad to have them.
