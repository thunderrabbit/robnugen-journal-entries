##20:31 Tuesday 21 February 2012

Today we came home a bit early and met Mama at the new bicycle parking place to scope it out.  I had a bad feeling about it because it's basically a machine that takes one bicycle at a time.  I don't want to queue up for even a minute to put my bicycle in the machine.  Plus it's further away than where we can park now, so I was like, ermmmmm.

 

BUT, they have five elevators, each of which seems pretty fast at its job.  We just bring the bicycle to the entrance and the RFID reader registers which bike it is and zooms the bike up to a spot.

 

On the way home, we go back to the same elevator, put our card into the slot (what?  no RFID???) and the bike associated with that card is returned in about 20 seconds, or, for me, about the time it takes to unlock TJ Bike now, which I won't have to do with this system...

 

It's more expensive, but may be faster; we'll find out when service starts in April.

 

Oh, but that's not why I'm writing.  Right now the guys are hanging out at the place to register new bikes for the April start.  They measure various dimensions and say "yep, it will fit," or, in the case of TJ Bike, "ummmmm, nah."

 

Damn.

 

So we went to another place and I was like, "ummmm, nah," because it would require waiting for three (3) long traffic lights, plus going past Kawasaki station to park the bikes.

 

Went back and said "aight fine," and took off the luggage rack from the front of TJ Bike.  It looks like he got a hair cut, but perhaps we'll be just a bit faster with the reduced weight and streamlined airflow.

 

I'll have to put it back on to go on a cross country tour, but I haven't had many of those recently..  sigh.
