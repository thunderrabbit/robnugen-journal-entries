I'm curious to see how posterous will treat the URL for a repeated title.  This is my first "work" entry on posterous, but certainly not my last if I keep using this service.

 

I've been consistently using redmine for a few weeks to handle tickets for our client.  It's neat to be nearly working with Lin!  I'll be seeing them tomorrow for a progress+strategy meeting.

 

Yesterday we met with Shorahb (sp) from our other client; he's supposed to take over the code for the 絵Phone箱, but I can hardly imagine it being easy for one person to do both Android and iPhone dev for the books.  Best of wishes for his success!
