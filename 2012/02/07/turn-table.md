##11:18 Tuesday 07 February 2012

I'm up to "Latin Lingo" by Cypress Hill in my alphabetical tune fest. When they did a shout out to Ralph M the Mexican, I remember that Everlast shouts him out as well on "All my Love" by House of Pain.

 

So anyway, I looked him up on YT and found this vid of him just screwing around, but in a totally dope way.

 

 

Notice why the video is paused at 1:25. Nice.
