I tried to move my furnace to expand the size of my burrow's main room, and saw a weird error come up when it normally would have said "furnace unregistered."

 

[LWC] Internal error. Notify an admin immediately. :BLOCK_BREAK

 

I was like "wut" and then I was like, O.o, and then I was like lol omg

 

The admin shrugged and was like ? when I told him, and life moves on.
