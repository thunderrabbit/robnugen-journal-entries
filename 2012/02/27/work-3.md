Nice to have my stack of redmine tickets only increase by 4 after our meeting today, instead of 18 or so after last two meetings.  

Two were easy to fix bugs, and one is a quick request; the other is a bit more involved, and steps into a realm I hadn't considered: reporting on internal user activity.

I look forward to whittling the list down to nothing.

Speaking of nothing, I have eight versions of Wish, though I think some are identical. 

Hope to see you soon Trent.
