hey g

 

I dreamt you were riding your bicycle back to the park and an obscured log stopped your front tire, but not the rest of you nor your bike.  You scraped your right forearm pretty well, but otherwise were fine-oh-fine.

 

In other news, I'm on Reading Deprivation Week of Soness's The Artist's Way course with Lin, so I can write, but not read your answer until Wednesday.  Gimme a skype call ifn you'd like.

 

I just tried to Skype dad who's online, but probably in class.

 

I just tried to Skype you and ma who are each offline.  Didn't work.

 

Lin's cooking breakfast and I've decided to stop playing minecraft *quite* so much.. hahah during reading deprivation week, I'm not playing Minecraft at all.  In the longer term, i'm going to get back in touch with my personal coach Kim Sawyer in Houston and be like "wazzaaaah" and tell him wazzap and get a more balanced lifestyle going on.  When I tell him "I work, I play minecraft, I sleep" he'll be like, "ummm, let's adjust that a bit"  So I'm adjusting it ahead of time.

 

Anyway blah blah how's your progress?  How's your summer plans?  Free associate with the words "Narita" and "arrive."
