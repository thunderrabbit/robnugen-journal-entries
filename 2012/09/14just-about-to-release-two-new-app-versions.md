It's been a struggle, but if we keep this up, I can only imagine it will get easier, and I'll look back and think, "man, what was I thinking??"

 

Right now, we've got three apps in the app store:  [Mike's English](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mikes-english/id553151517?mt=8&uo=4) available outside Japan, and [楽しい英語](http://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/leshii-ying-yu/id558509841?mt=8&uo=4) and [読み書き英語](http://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/dumi-shuki-ying-yu/id550411320?mt=8&uo=4) inside Japan.  The apps are similar, but the ones in Japan contain a bit of Japanese content, and are geared more towards Tariq's book, which is not yet available in the US.

 

 

Anyway, as I was preparing to upload the new versions, I noted that our little list of apps is slowly growing.  Decided to take a baby photo of our app collection.
