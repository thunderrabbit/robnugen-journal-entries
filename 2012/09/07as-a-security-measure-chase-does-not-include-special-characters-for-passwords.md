Time to harass Chase again for their crappy password policies.  I asked them why they only allow 32 character passwords.  "Are you storing them in plaintext?"  And why don't they allow special characters in my password?  "Are you afraid of SQL injection?"

Their reply included this gem.

 

"As a security measure, we do not include special characters for user ids and passwords."

 

WTF?

 

I'm not sure where to start, but I think I'll start looking for another bank.  Maybe a credit union or something will have everything I need, and far fewer fees.  Chase has been siphoning $12 PER MONTH so that I can have my money in their account.
