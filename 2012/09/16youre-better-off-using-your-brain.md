I know [how to spell your and you're](https://www.elearnenglishlanguage.com/difficulties/youryoure.html).

 

I often see things like "your stupid" or "stay in you're mom's basement" in stupid comment battles.  Each time, I wonder if I can think of a sentence where either word could be used while keeping the sentence grammatically correct.

 

This is quickly foiled by a large difference in the grammatical usage of the words.

 

"Your" is your basic possessive pronoun.  Use "you're" and you're using a pronoun and a verb.

 

I imagine this difference can be overcome with careful use of [words which can be considered nouns or verbs](https://www.enchantedlearning.com/wordlist/nounandverb.shtml), depending on their usage.  However you're still pretty much left with

 

Your NOUN

 

 
  * your dog
 
  * your cat
 
  * your mama
   

OR

 

You're VERBING

 

 
  * you're dancing
 
  * you're eating
 
  * you're yelling
   

You're VERBED (actually I'm not sure what these are)

 

 
  * you're screwed
 
  * you're tired
 
  * you're required
   

You're ADJECTIVE

 

 
  * you're smart
 
  * you're sexy
 
  * you're cool
   

- - - - -

 

Hmm, looking a the above, I see some options, but they need punctuative support.

 

You're smart, dog.

 

Your smart dog.  (could be used as an answer to who solved the crime.)

 

I'll keep thinking about it.....

 

You're smart, leave your suggestions in the comments!
