_At the airport waiting for Lin to arrive, I saw a pregnant woman walking by and thought she was Lin. "woah, she's showing a lot more than I expected!" Then I realized Lin is not pregnant so that couldn't have been her. We got in the van driving home in Texas, and I remembered the time that Sabina had been at the airport but couldn't remember the way home so stayed there all day until we got back. I turned left on Stuebner Airline where she hadn't turned left, not recognizing the street, even though the train announcer voice explained what would be there if we turned left. There were some mattresses in the street and I hit one, thinking we could drive right over it and boom flat tire and I woke up._
