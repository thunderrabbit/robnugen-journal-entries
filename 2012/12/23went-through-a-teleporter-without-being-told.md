_In a military built facility, there was a door designed for entry only, but from previous experience, we knew it would be more efficient to just go out the in door than to go around to the designated out door.  However, this time when we went out the in door, we were suddenly in a room 20 yards back from where we thought we'd be. I was like, "?" and then went through the proper out door and we all got into the group again..  I asked others if they noticed anything weird while coming out of the facility.  Three of us agreed on the same experience.  I confronted one of the technicians there. "Is there a teleporter in the facility?" and she directly lied and said NO.  I was like, "okay, has anyone else expressed the same thing that we did: they were unable to go out the in door because they were shifted backwards in the facility?   She said yes, because that question is one they hadn't been told they must lie about._

_ah ha! we thought.  What a prefect way to test the technology for mass consumption to see if it can be safely used on people!_
