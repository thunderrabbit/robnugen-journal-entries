Just leaving Charu's house after an afternoon of sewing there.   Lin made a bunch of owls for people, and I made a dog for her mom.  Made with love, but nothing technically amazing; they're just 2D pillows.

I was gonna work on 楽しい英語, but got so tied up sewing, I just sewed instead.  The seams seemed like a good thing at the time.
