~~No pics yet~~ but they might be on my mom's FB wall already.

Ma, Mama, Lin, Fred, and I shared gifts and laughter.   I had the most fun watching Lin unwrap her teddy bear.  The outer box was apparently mailed from Fred to me, the next inner box was from me to Fred; the next inner box was from Fred to Lin; the next inner box was from Lin to Lin; the next inner box was from Lin to Ma; the next inner bag was from Ma to Mama; the next inner box was from Mama to me, but that box was actually for Lin, which she could see very clearly from its branding.  Lin was totally excited, and I'm totally pleased that it worked so well.

In addition to shampoo I requested, Fred got me a 3D model puzzle of the Burj Khalifa, plus another old puzzle from back in the day (of which he has two copies).

Lin got me an RC helicopter with camera on it!!  I wonder how many times I'll be able to fly it successfully.

In addition to dental floss I requested, Ma got (the dry) chocolate chip cookie making ingredients for Lin and me (except for flour).

For fun, Fred brought one of the old sets of [Tipovers](https://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=321011097812) that we had back in the day.
