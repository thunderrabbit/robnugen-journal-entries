The AB project has classes I created a year ago, at which time were the next iteration of our in-house framework.   Six months ago we created the *next* iteration, which handles multi-lingual sites a bit more elegantly.

So now the AB project's front end will be using the new classes while the back end is still on the old classes.  But the front end has some classes in the back end so they can make updates to the public facing site.  I wonder how long it's going to be before I say "bah" and upgrade all the classes to the same iteration.   I'd do it now, but I'm not sure how I'd get all the historical data updated to the new style, all while keeping the site humming along.
