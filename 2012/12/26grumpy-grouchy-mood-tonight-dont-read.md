Grumpy grouchy poopypants mood tonight and I don't know why.  I hate myself for taking it out on Lin, nitpicking how she did this or that differently than I would have.  For fuck's sake she does SO MUCH work around the house, how the fuck can I nitpick her for it?  It's fucking lunacy.  She cooks, washes dishes, even ensures the stove is spotless every night.  Not on my request, either; I'm used to living a bachelor life with sink full of dishes, etc.  She makes my lunch each day (or more often the night before), thinking about what's good + delicious.  How can I complain?   grrrr stupid <del>me</del> <del>brain</del> _ego_.

At least I'm able to communicate with her that I'm feeling grumpy and she should all but ignore me, and not take it personally, if at all possible.  I know intellectually that this grumpiness is all my shit and she just happens to be a convenient target.  Gah.
