Kris was a repeat GET teacher on PB49th voyage; we hung out in Le Havre, France with Francois, Dave, and Kuni, enjoying wine and cheese and lovely architecture.   She just Skyped me out of the blue this morning (and by this morning, I mean 4pm Monday night, due to time zone differences), and by she skyped me, I mean her nearly-2-year-old daughter Skyped me!

We chatted a bit; her friend Luke from 47 is in town from OZ for a week.  Nice to reconnect with old friends.  :-)
