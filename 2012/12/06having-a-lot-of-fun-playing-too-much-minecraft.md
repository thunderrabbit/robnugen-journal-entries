This is a view from inside the hole I'm digging as part of a Minecraft art project I've got in mind.  I plan to put a stop-action animation of the hole being dug on youtube.  Earlier, while researching stuff for work, I found [bigdinosaur.org](https://www.bigdinosaur.org/), on which a blog entry was posted about something work related.  mySQL or Javascript or some such.  Anyway, in the side bar he mentioned he liked Minecraft.  Hmm!  I also kinda want to have my server available on the world wide interwebs, but I don't really wanna pay a monthly fee to do it.  Maybe a group of us could all pitch in.  hmm.
