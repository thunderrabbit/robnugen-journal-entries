##00:51 Sunday 23 December 2012

I'm still not quite great with the caretaking.  For example, when I came up to the table to just sit, they were like, "do you want sushi?  do you want rice?  do you want cake?  which do you want?" and I was like, "no thanks" and then boom a plate appeared and food that I didn't want was presented.

Um.

I noticed how spoiled the kids are. I don't think it's just *these* kids, but I've heard rumors and anecdotal evidence that it's like this for many Japanese kids. Every whine, pout, request, was immediately pandered. Ugh.

We can't touch the 9 month old baby without washing hands first. Why? Don't we want to build up his immune system?

When the 2 year old was trying to pull Lin's iPad away from the 6 year old who had been playing with it, I saw them doing a little tug of war. I was like, "false," and simply removed it from the realm of possibility.

Playing hide and seek with the kids was fun, reminding me of Fred and I playing hide and seek.  But I was bemused by how entertained they were with so few places to hide.  I mean, there were three places to hide:  (kneeling under the table, standing on the lee side of a shelf, and standing behind the door of the room).  Anywhere else would be immediately visible when someone entered the room.  I showed them a fourth place to hide, made by moving the very light couch a bit forward and lying down behind that.

I found an excellent hiding technique which I wasn't able to implement: climb over a counter and through the door to the next room (which was blocked by the counter).  I couldn't use it because the room into which I would vanish was adjacent to the waiting area used by people before trying to find the hiders.  Hmm.

I wore shoes today (for the first time since May *) because it was cold, and wet, *and* I have three (3) skin splits (as opposed to shin splints?) on my left foot. My right foot is fine.

(* except for the day I went to get my visa, and two days I went to meet my client for business meetings)
