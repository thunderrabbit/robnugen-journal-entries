_Looking at some notes, I found a cryptic word like Pinecal, and then Obreil.  With those, I was able to look up online that they're putting together a property in Hawaii!  Awesome!  Just as I was looking away from the notes, I heard her behind me, "is someone off the list?"  I was caught looking where I shouldn't have been looking.  I didn't lie; I just said "yes," and then she lied for me so no one else would know.  "You're on the list; I love J-pop!!"_

Woke up, oh it was all a dream... _whew!_  I'm still on the list!
