Fred, Ma, Lin and I went across the river to play with the RC helicopter Lin got for me.  Success: it's still flyable after a full battery cycle!   The packaging says it will fly for about 10 minutes on a single charge.  I got to fly it first, and the wind blew it pretty far away (as it flew up up up up) and to bring it down before hitting the highway, I nearly plummeted it down like a fragile plastic rock and broke the case of the camera, plus the shell of the copter.

It didn't work afterward, but then it started to work again; it seems to take its time before it wants to start again.

Lin seemed to fly it the best, with Ma a close second.  She landed it in the tennis court area, so I got to climb up and down the fence (and used the steps of the referee seat to climb down/up on the inside).

There was a guy out there with a "sport kite," which had two strings on each side.  He had been using it for 10 years, and could do some neat maneuvers with it.  Fred got to play with the kite a decent amount of time and was able to control it a bit by the end, including launching it upside down from the ground.
