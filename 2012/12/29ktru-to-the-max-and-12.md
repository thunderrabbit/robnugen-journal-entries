OMG this is so amazing!!!

First, it's amazing that I can listen to KTRU at all on this fancy series of tubes called the internizz.   Second, Fred and I were listening to the Vinyl Frontier's Christmas show a couple nights ago; fun times.  but that's not why I'm writing.

It's amazing that MK Ultra show is still kickin' it.  I enjoyed listening to the whole [3 hours played by Dijon](http://noise.rice.edu/ktru/sheet.nsf/15aa60c8727df106802568e90056b4d1/9b62ecd77c6ac6e386257ae300124f48?OpenDocument), so I called him near the end just to say HI and what's up from Tokyo, etc.  We chatted for a bit, mostly me asking what had changed and what has stayed the same at the station in all those years since I was there.

He ended his shift with a song by an artist from Tokyo, then he closed his show with something like, "yeah that was <artist name> all the way from **Japan**," giving just a bit of emphasis to the final word so I knew he was saying HI to me.

I called *back*, and the next DJ (TomZ) answered.  "Dijon?" I asked.

"No he's in the other room; how can I help you?"

"Oh, I just wanted to thank him for the shout out to Japan; I called him from Tokyo a second ago."

"Oh!  You're the Tokyo guy! hang on"

I held; I said thanks to Dijon and got his IM address.   Moments later, via text message, Dijon assured me I should listen to the next DJ, TomZ.


3:01 PM dijon: sup rob, thanks for listening tonight. the dude who's on now is crazy... i'd keep listening for a minute if you're able.




 me: With that invitation, how can I resist?? ;-)




  Thank you for playing even while having a bit of a cough... keeping the music moving!




3:02 PM if you're still in the staiton[sic], tell him I'm still listening. :-) yes, he sounds a bit crazy!




3:04 PM dijon: tom's chill. i gave him the message and he threw his hands in the air in an expression of pure joy


After that, things went a bit crazy.

TomZ came on the air between songs like, "thanks for listening Thunder Rabbit! All the way from Tokyo.  By the way, I don't know if you remember, but I used to rollerblade with you back in the day, so anyway, thanks for listening"

WHAT?????   Holy cats my brain was like WHAT??  How can he remember that?  How can I remember him??  I met so many people inline skating...   But Google has the memory of a massive computer brain so (while Tom was playing some noise music,) I looked it up, and found [a skate entry, at the very bottom of which is Tom's name.](http://robnugen.com/cgi-bin/journal.pl?type=skate&date=1995/01/20)

While texting Tom that journal entry, plus "my wife doesn't like this noise music haha," he was on air again, confirming my previous "WHAT" message with, "yeah, back in the day, we met while skating, and I was like, wow that's cool.. and... life goes on," and while he was speaking, more brain cells started to wake up in my brain, ... "he sounds like that guy who ran for City Council!  What was his name???" and I text *that* to him, and I was right!

He laughed, like, "heh.  Yeah.  Back in 19__ I ran for City Council At Large position #4, and got 19,474 votes which was 18% of the vote that year... "  etc, "so maybe some memories are happening..  Oh, and hi wifey who doesn't like noise music!"

I've been writing this since then so haven't written back, but I'll send him the link right ... now.

PS: TomZ, Lin says HI!
