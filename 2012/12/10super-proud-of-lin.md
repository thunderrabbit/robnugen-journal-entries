She's making some small and big stretches in her life...  This Christmas she's making some gifts for family (instead of just buying stuff).    (that's what I'm calling the small stretch.)

The big thing about which I'm super impressed: she just applied for a new job .... in Thailand!!  Wow!  She's always wanted to travel, and I've always said, "so when are you going to do it???"   I've kept telling her, "no you *don't* have to have X first," where X for Lin has usually been "money" or ... I guess permission from her [self/family].

She's definitely got permission from me!  I look forward to visiting her in Bangkok, and taking her to see Chiang Mai!
