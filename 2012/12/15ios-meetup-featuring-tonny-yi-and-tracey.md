Today at the [iOS meeting](https://www.meetup.com/TokyoiOSMeetup/), Tonny gave a presentation on LLDB, Yi gave a presentation on iOS 6 Constraints, and Tracey gave a case study of customer service prowess.

I'm looking forward to Matt's iOS classes starting in January.Â  He said he wants to start with "what's really going on under the surface of Xcode," an idea I heartily agree will help me figure out wtf is going on half the time with Xcode.
