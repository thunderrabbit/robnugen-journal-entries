Not *this* URL, but this one: [http://www.longbets.org/601/](http://longbets.org/601/), or so the bettor suggests.  I'm sure the URL will work fine, along with its friend http://longbets.org/601/ as well as future URIs in to-be-developed retrieval systems.

Anyway, I just thought the bet was interesting, so I took a couple screenshots.

I wonder if the [URL for this blog entry](http://robnugen.com/blog/2012/11/24/this-url-will-not-exist-in-2022) will still work; I've been debating ditching Wordpress for another home built system, perhaps using an upgraded version of my old system.  Still want a nice way to host images with automagic resize based on URL parameters.
