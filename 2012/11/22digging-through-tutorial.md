This tutorial has taken me a bit to grok, but the turning point was when I printed all the code and started highlighting bits of it.

Also, I just found that [grooveshark](http://grooveshark.com/) works well on my mobile device.  sweet!

Hi Rob,

I noticed you've shared Grooveshark (http://grooveshark.com/) on this page http://robnugen.com/blog/2012/11/22/digging-through-tutorial/, as you are no doubt aware, Grooveshark actually closed down back in 2015.

We’ve put together a guide to the best alternatives in 2017. Here’s the link - http://comparitech.net/limewire-grooveshark-alternative

Perhaps you could update your page to include a link to our guide so that anyone still interested in Grooveshark has an alternative.

I hope this helps.

-Anthony
