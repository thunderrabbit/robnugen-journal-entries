I found a fiverr gig that got lots of rave reviews.  Ashley [will start your family tree for you and go back 4 generations for $5](http://fiverr.com/tn5rr2012/trace-your-family-tree-for-you-and-go-back-4-generations). I don't know who Ashely is, but she had great reviews, so I sent her $10, my grandparents names on both sides of my family, and she got to work.  For an extra $10 per search, she'll send all the images and sources she finds during the process.

My lovely dear [Laura Wallace](http://laura.chinet.com/oldindex.html) helped me get started with genealogy (with [The Master Genealogist](http://www.whollygenes.com)  (TMG)) back in the day.  That software is only available for Windows, so I recently installed an ISO of windows XP in [Virtual Box](http://virtualbox.org), loaded a 30 day trial of TMG and updated my 10+ year old data to the new TMG format.

I was thinking of just using TMG in the Windows window of my Mac, but searched around and found two (of many!) Mac options that I considered using.  The first was Family Tree Maker by ancestry.com.  I was just about to buy (into its) advertising, when I decided to do a bit more digging.  It seems that ancestry.com is the Blob that Ate Free Genealogy sites, with its many [acquisitions of formerly free services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestry.com#Other_sites).

Then I found [Family Search](https://familysearch.org), which is free!  There's a Mac version of [FamilyInsight by Ohana Software](http://www.ohanasoftware.com), which costs $25 (per year I think), but even if it's per year, it's 1/10th the price of ancestry.com's option.

Apparently ancestry.com has a huge database of names and sources, but I think I'll be quite fine for a while on familysearch.org.
