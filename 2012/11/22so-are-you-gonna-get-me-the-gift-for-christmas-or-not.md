Lin asked me tonight if I planned to buy the gift she wanted for Christmas.

Don't tell Lin, but I ordered it two days ago.  I didn't tell her tonight because that's not much of a Christmas surprise if I tell her now!   It was a bit difficult not to tell her, but I was able to convince her that I planned not to buy it with responses like, "what are ya gonna do with it anyway, but just put it on the shelf?"
