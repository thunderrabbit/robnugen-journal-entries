##07:31 Sunday 18 November 2012

Lin was typing a password or something into a computer, but it
    kept rejecting what she typed.  I noticed that she hadn't read
    all the instructions at the top of the page so I told her to 
    read them first.  She kept typing the same (wrong) thing and 
    was getting more and more frustrated that it wasn't working.  I
    kept getting more and more frustrated that she wasn't listening
    to me.  I yelled at her, slid my hands across all the keys to 
    write crap data into the password field, all just to get her 
    attention.
    
    The waiter next to us was surprised, and I said "I'm sorry; I 
    have an issue of getting super angry if people don't listen to 
    me; it's not her faultÂ but I take it out on her.
    
    I started to do some kind of self-healing to release the anger, 
    and during that process, I woke up,


I woke up realizing that I can do a bit better and be less angry if Lin misunderstands or otherwise seems to not listen to me.
