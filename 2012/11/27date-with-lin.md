##21:53 Tuesday 27 November 2012

Lin and I went on an impromptu date tonight, first visiting the ramen place adjacent to Kawasaki station, but turning away from its 20 minute line.

We were going to go to the cheap and delicious Chinese place with the cute-nosed waitress, but then I suggested we try Taro's restaurant.  Taro stands out on the corner soliciting customers, and has a super genki personality that piqued my curiosity enough to try the place.  Plus he speaks English (and German, and Spanish,) and Japanese.

4000 yen for not enough to fill us is not enough to bring us back again.  Sorry, Taro.

SO, we went to the Chinese place to get ramen and gyoza.  The cute girl wasn't there!!!  I was glad she had a day off (she always seems to be there when we're there), but then she came back a bit after we arrived.  Yay!  I mean boo!  I mean Yay!!
