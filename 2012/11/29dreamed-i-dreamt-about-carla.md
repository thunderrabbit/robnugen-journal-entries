_In a camp area, getting to hang out with Carla after talking to some guys while up on stage prepping for an event, I told her how much I admired her ability to be genki with people and how I want to enjoying hanging out with peeps as much as she does.  Something like how I need to just not worry about what other people think and just do whatever I want to do.  Or maybe just be able to chill with people and not worry about stuff._

_We walked over to the housing area and I asked which bunk was hers.  She indicated the second floor of a building across the street from my building.  I had a space on the ground floor.  We didn't actually go to each other's areas, but just wanted to make sure we knew in case there was some reason to in the future._

_I told her about the dream I had where we were both on PB again, and the waves were really rocking the boat, but we were still having fun and talking to the crew in the lounge area, listening to music._

I woke up not knowing if I had dreamed the dream I described in my dream or if I dreamed it during the dream.
