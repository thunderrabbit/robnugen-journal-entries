Being married has its perks.  One is free kisses.  Another is permission to stay in Japan.  I got my new visa today, and due to Japan's new system, it's *not* a sticker in my passport.  It's in a chip in my new card.  And it expires in only a year.  Gah.  I wonder why it expires so soon; I used to get three year visas by being a programmer.
