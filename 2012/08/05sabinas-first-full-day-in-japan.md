##10:51 Sunday 05 August 2012

Lin and I had great fun yesterday with Sabina, including:

 

1) Sabina repeatedly saying, "that's so cooolll!" as she found another cool bug/insect/arthropod/critter walking among the wet leaves in Meiji-Jingu

4) Totally taking a nap on a hammock-bench thing on the top floor of a new building in Omote-Sando.  I really enjoyed this and wish we had some photos... The building is on the interesection of Omote-Sando-Dori and Meiji-Dori opposite the Condomania building.  Go to the top, following the small green arrows marked with three green pine trees and number of meters remaining to our destination.  Greeted with coffee shops, outdoor stools leashed to the ground around a bar surrounding a glass skylite, down through which I couldn't see anything because the glass seemed cloudy and I didn't try to hard, we could look through the rooftop trees out over edge of the building through the glass to keep us on the building.

 

We found three adjacent stools around the bar, but as soon as we were sitting down, Lin noticed a hammock bench was available behind us.  It has a view through the glass, on which I could see the reflection of a building behind our building.  I planted myself in the middle of the bench so I could be between Lin and Sabina, and we Lin promptly fell asleep.  Sabina and I talked a bit about how people's musculature twitches, er I mean [fasciculation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasciculation) while falling asleep.

 

I said to Sabina, "I really love this one," where "this one" meant Lin, but I didn't want to wake her up by saying her name.

 

Sabina was like, "Lin?"

 

"yeah"

 

"Yeah, it's really nice to see how much you two love each other."

 

5) The Pink Cow!  Lin went home, and Sabina and I went to The Pink Cow for the Mooooooving Party, as The Pink Cow is moving from Shibuya to Roppongi!  Lensei was on keyboard with his amazing skillz freestyling with the cow jammers (Jon and Jin??) on drums and bass guitar, with their amazing skillz.

 

Saw [Roy](http://www.fudworks.daportfolio.com/), Peter (who will be performing this Tuesday night at Double Tall Cafe' in Shibuya), Leslie, who I got to massage and who showed me pictures of her 7mo baby Annalise, Traci, looking genki and sexy in her wedding dress (marrying the Roppongi Pink Cow), DJ Miki, who I probably haven't seen in the longest time.

 

Great to see "[David Whitaker (lovemademusic)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1A8yAfR0ww)" and his wife perform a few songs..  man, such power! and such passion! I want to buy an album of his stuff.

 

Marcellus performed some poetry, three different ones including "Jazz Man" I think.

 

JJ Vicars was on as we left; I gave him a pat on the knee as he was playing and in no position to hug!!

 

So tired on the way home after such an awesome day!
