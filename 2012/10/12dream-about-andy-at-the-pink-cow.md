Sitting with two of Andy's long-time friends, I got to hear how he became associated with the Pink Cow.   He had been working in a bar serving beer when a guy noticed how precisely Andy served the beers, taking great care that each one was optimally poured with a perfect foamy head that just crested the top of the mug. The guy asked Andy if he could mix drinks as well.  Andy was like, "I can mix any drink you can name."  The guy named a few drinks and Andy mixed them perfectly, better than the guy had ever previously tasted.  Could Andy cook?  Absolutely; it turns out that Andy's hands have a different DNA than the rest of his body; his hands themselves know how to prepare any dish ever prepared or ever desired.----

Why was I dreaming about Andy at [The Pink Cow](https://www.thepinkcow.com)?  I guess it's time to go back and check out the new location again!!
