  * I haven't written a SoML in a while.

	
  * Fred and Ma are coming to Japan in December!!

	
  * Lin and I have been going to yoga class every Saturday morning at [Yogasan](http://yogasan.net).

	
  * I've been working at sbstrm for going on 3 years now, not counting my Thailand adventure and chilling in Chigasaki.

	
  * My long-running project at sbstrm is for AB, for whom Lin used to work.

	
  * Most recently been working on A4F's new site, rebuilding their wordpress site with the latest iteration of our custom framework.

	
  * After work, I've been working with Tariq on iPhone development.  We have three apps out at this time: Mike's English outside Japan, and 楽しい英語, and 読み書き英語 available in Japan.  They are not free apps, and I think that may have been a mistake. Might make them free and have in-app purchases for goodies in the apps.

	
  * Most recently been working on a 2D game app using Cocos2D and Box2D.  I've been looking at the option of using Sparrow and Chipmunk as well, though Chipmunk doesn't yet support iOS 6.0 due to some bugs in XCode compilers or something.

	
  * So right *now*, while I'm typing, my computer is downloading XCode 4.3.3 so I can get a copy of iphoneos5.1.sdk so I can evaluate Chipmunk.

	
  * My computer is new since my last SoML.  It's a Macbook Pro, with retina display, 256Gig SSD drive, and 16 GB of RAM.  It's not as fast as it should be, though it is faster than my previous machine.  Sometimes Finder just locks up and loses its mind for 20 seconds and then starts working again.  Why?

	
  * I'm running OS X 10.7.5 ("Lion") because I still haven't received my "upgrade" code to Mountain Lion.

	
  * For iPhone dev purposes, I got an iPhone 5.  Its name is Johnny Five, named after the character in Short Circuit.  For AU evaluation purposes (plus they allow tethering (feeding WiFi to local devices from my phone via its cellular service)), I'm using AU instead of Softbank.  Interesting tidbit: it took me about 1 day to get my iPhone 5 after they were released.   Lin ordered hers through softbank (on the same day as I ordered mine through AU), and didn't get a call from them for a couple weeks, during which time she was like, "bah" and told them they can keep their phone when they said it was finally available. 

	
  * I've still got my iPhone4S for everyday use.  Its name is Little Blue Monkey, because when I first got it, I had a blue case for it.

	
  * I recently wrote a Wordpress plugin to create bingo cards, but haven't polished it nor a site to run it.

	
  * Due to all this coding, I haven't drawn any mazes recently, though I did get a maze request via [Fiverr](http://fiverr.com/thunderrabbit) recently.

	
  * I've been reading A Course In Miracles; I'm about this far through the book which is THIS thick.

	
  * I haven't played Minecraft in about a week.

	
  * Recently Andrew and I received the [Elevation Docks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009PM82UE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009PM82UE&linkCode=as2&tag=keepusthelim-20) we ordered a long time ago.  They're quite nice.  I got limited edition green one; he got orange.  We also each got a <del>silver</del> brushed aluminum and black one.  Lin got my silver one, and the black one is on my desk at work.
