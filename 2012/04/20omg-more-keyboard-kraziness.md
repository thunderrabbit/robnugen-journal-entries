So I got the keyboard and re-offered it to the guy this morning at 9am.

 

He wrote back at 10am to say yes, and I didn't get the email until nearly 8pm when I got home!! I was checking my email all day; ask my brother! Ask my boss! Ask Colleen!! so freakin' weird.

 

I offered to meet him at Kawasaki station this weekend; I hadn't really had plans to go up to Tokyo, but if he really wants it, perhaps he doesn't want to wait until Monday.
