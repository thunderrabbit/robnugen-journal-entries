I've had a semi-forgotten bluetooth wireless keyboard in a box by my desk for over a year. I decided to post a message to Toyko Freecycle to see if anyone wanted it.

 

One guy replied "is it bluetooth?"

 

One woman replied, "I want it."

 

 

I replied "yes" and "where are you?" respectively.

 

They replied, "I want it" and "Meguro" respectively.

 

 

I replied "sorry it's taken" and "see you soon" respectively.

 

 

But since the woman wants it for a play and doesn't care if it works, I've ungiven it to her and will re-offer it to the guy.
