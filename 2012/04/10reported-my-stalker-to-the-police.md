##01:53 Tuesday 10 April 2012

Lin has been wanting to do this for a while, and I declined because I thought the phone calls would stop, but today my stalker called four (4) times between 9:19pm and 9:25pm, leaving three voice messages consisting of just slight microphone rustly noise for a totaly of about 2.5 minutes.

 

The police were like, "aight so what do you want?"

 

and it was decided that Lin will write an email in Japanese asking her to stop and desist, and one of the officers called her to report the reporting of her behavior.

 

My true honest hope is that we all learn from the process and that everyone benefits.
