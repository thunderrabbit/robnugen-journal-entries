I may sound like Grampa on The Simpsons, but the interface to provide feedback to chase.com can be improved with just a few obvious tweaks.

 

Tweak 1) the form doesn't need to ask for my name, much less make it a required field; I'm logged in ffs, so you have my name.

 

Tweak 2) fix the CSS; when I expand the textarea (thank you very much for that), the absolutely positioned line below it should move out of the way.

 

Tweak 1.5) the radio buttons preceeded by "Would you like us to contact you?" default to Yes, which is fine, but how are you going to contact me without my email address? Oh, you have it already right? Then why are you asking for my name?

 

Which brings me back to point 1: I'm already logged in so I shouldn't have to type in my name!

 

Sincerely

 

Grampa
