I was really moejoe (*) on my way out of the house today, but the weather was optimal and I had told myself I would do it on such optimal days, so I turned right to go over the bridge to Tokyo instead of left down the street to the bicycle parking garage.

 

The first few turns are easy though I thought I might have missed the fifth turn until I saw its landmark, a post office that means veer left here.

 

Veered left, veered right, etc etc.

 

I just started to draw a map but need to start workin'

(*) moejoe means lazy or otherwise adverse to doing something
