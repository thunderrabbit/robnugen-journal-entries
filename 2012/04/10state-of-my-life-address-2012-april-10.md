##19:58 Tuesday 10 April 2012

I was going to do some iPhone dev when I got home, but suddenly got into journaling.

 

 
  1. Lin and I are married, living in Kawasaki, overlooking Tamagawa into Tokyo. We can see Tokyo Sky Tree from our window.
 
  2. The wind can see us pretty well through the window, given that it has a nice view of our building from over the river.
 
  3. Lin's mom lives with us, though is on a schedule about 4 hours earlier than ours, so we don't get to hang out too much.
 
  4. I've sorta kinda started studying Japanese with [iknow.jp](http://iknow.jp/?referrer=thunderrabbit&please_start=a_referral_program). So far I've gotten like 65% through the first 100 words and 40% through the second 100 words
 
  5. Tariq and I are working together on iPhone development; we have a couple of app ideas that should be interesting
 
  6. My iPhone is a 4S; my white MacBook is the same one I've had for a while; I'm planning to get a new MacBook (Pro?) this summer
 
  7. Someone very special is coming back home soon
 
  8. Lin  and I are ostensibly in week 9 or so with the Artists Way Group, but I  think most people are no longer really doing the exercises.
 
  9. We've  got Hulu available on our TV (yes, a TV omg) and watch movies  sometimes. Probably have seen about 30 moves in two or three months
 
  10. I'm  working at sbstrm with Andrew and Sho; we're working hard, and I'm  about to finish my first year contract in May and start a new one.  We're a small team with the sbstrm dream.
 
  11. For about the past three weeks, I've been listening (on continuous repeat) to the soothing sounds of [kinessence](http://kinessence.com/)
 
  12. The  only thing I don't like about Posterous: I can't edit posts later and  have it autoupdate all the previously posted posts. (at least I don't  think I can)
