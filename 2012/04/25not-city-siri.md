Wow this voice recognition thing is pretty cool and iPhone. I was able to write a pretty long message to my friend one sentence at a time.

The above two sentences I wrote in one go by saying period in between each one.

Right now I'm at the last artist way meeting of Spring 2012. We're about to leave in 15 minutes I think.

So I'm just testing on my iPhone and write in journal entries. 

We are pretty close to having Tudie be able to understand what I'm actually saying and not just transcribing words that you here. If we have the technology that Google had with Google wave then we can probably do pretty cool thank you.

So I'm trying to think and speak in real-time and try to make a low thing for city to transcribe.

But at the same time I can't laugh to think about the future grandkids same grandpa you had to type with your fingers you had to not talk to the computer mama blah craziness. 

Close enough city, close enough.

And by city I mean CD. 

No, Siri!!!

I had to type those last two words. Dammit.
