Though I forgot to get photographic evidence, Lin and I ate soup in [Shinagawa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinagawa_Station) at Soup Stock in eCute.  It's super nice to be on a more normal schedule; I went in from 10am to 7pm today.  Much better than 7am to 10pm!

 

I got the next set of PDFs finished; these are basically different versions of PDFs for clients.  The system is coming together step by step.

 

I just realized there's no apparent way to tag posts in posterous.  I can do it afterward on my bl, ahem, my journal, but it'd be nice to be able to do it here too.

 

Oh I found it: under post options.
