##00:44 Sunday 29 January 2012

As Fred noted some time ago, I haven't been writing in my journal much recently.  I blame it on having just been too dang busy at work for my own good.  I have neglected amazeaweek.net, meditation, my marble track, and The Pink Cow.

I haven't, however, really neglected Minecraft recently.  It has swallowed a lot of my time, but oh-my-gosh does it tap into some childhood dreams!!  In this virtual world, I've got an underground burrow connected to a nearly endless series of mysterious mine shafts, through which I'm building a roller coaster of a minecart track that connects the bottom of my water slide to the top, which features clear glass spanning two tall cliffs and the roller coaster track spiraling around it!

Even more recently, I have found some tools to help me journal more easily.  Thing is, to really use them in a way that puts the entries on my website, I've got to switch to Wordpress. (*)

 

(*) or I have to wait until I upgrade my old Perl code to have an API through which it can accept incoming posts, including audio and images.

 

SO, as of today, given that Wordpress seeeeeeems to be stable and sticking around for the next few possible days, and years (shout out to [LouStar](http://www.reverbnation.com/artist/song_details/6926112)), I'm officially going to start using my "blog" as my journal.

 

My [old journal](http://robnugen.com/cgi-bin/journal.pl) will continue to be available until further notice (almost certainly until after I import all its textual and imagery goodness into wordpress) but just won't be the default landing page for robnugen.com.

 

Congratulations, and thank you, [Word](http://wordpress.org/)[press](http://wordpress.com/).

 

I'm typing right now using [posterous](http://posterous.com/), and earlier today sent several audio snippets, er, boos, with [audioboo](http://audioboo.fm).  For the past few weeks, I've been writing little bits and uploading pics with [Path](http://path.com/), though that *might* fall by the wayside as there's no way yet to really link it with other stuff on the interwebs.
