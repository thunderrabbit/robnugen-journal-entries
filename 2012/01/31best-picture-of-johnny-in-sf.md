Over our Christmas holidays, Lin and I went to San Francisco to see her uncle, and then to Texas to see my family and have a wedding ceremony on 30 December at Northwoods UU which was my church while I was in Texas growing up. 

I hope to write more about the ceremony, but for now I want to archive this awesome picture of Johnny flying over the ________ in San Francisco.  I can't remember / find the name of the place..

Free hug if you know the name!!
