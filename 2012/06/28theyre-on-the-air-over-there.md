Here in our office, Yama is interviewing a couple of guys about some DJ mixing equipment. I don't really know much other than that, but it's a bit of a change from the normally silent office.

 

I've been working on loading and saving objects with an optional one-to-one relationship. Unfortunately my logic is buggy so I will probably have to step away from the keyboard and figure out a reasonable way to do this.

 

One way to do it includes duplicating a lot of code, but I won't do that; grrrr.
