_Walking by Traci's bottle shop, which is closed on Sundays, I saw a kid go into the shop.  I knew he wasn't going to hurt anything, but just needed aplace to sleep, but I wanted tomake sure so I went in after him._

 

_He had set up a barrier of bottles as alarms so that people couldn't get to where he was without the bottles  banging together to alert him.  He had his body outlines with bottles and was sleeping ther.  We came in aand he woke up, and I showed him peace sign with two fingrs to tell him not to worry.  He was worried though and tried to leave or explain why we should leave him alone._

 

_Some guys in a car outside were arguing, and a guy came in to ask if we could help.  I was like well, not really, and oone of the guys in the car shot another guy in the car, killing him.  The guy who had come in was interested in a large machine in the shop, which could monitor nuclear missles around the world and other information that he wanted to monitor.  I said he can use the machine, but he was like, "I'm going to take the machine," and I go, you mean and bring it back?  and he was like no, and that's when the guy shot the other guy in the car as if to show they were serious business._
