Today I posted a pic of me with a tiger tail for a moustache on Android chat on Stackoverflow because Graeme wondered what I looked like.  This led to a chat full of win, and I posted a screenshot of it on my wiki.

Therefore I found my wiki entry of Lin,

and realized I've not touched my wiki in some time..  So I updated pics of Alex for his 1+ year birthday  [https://robnugen.com/wiki/Peeps:Alex](https://robnugen.com/wiki/Peeps:Alex)

 

Lin bought cards for Fred and Ma + Jon's June birthdays; we signed them and I'll post them tomorrow.  I forgot to take pics, but didn't forget to put a bit of cash into Fred's.

 

At work today I nearly finished cleaning up our core framework for use in the next project, Beach Saiko!!.

 

At iPhone work today (Chatforest), I am officially stuck trying to get the provisioning keys sorted out.  Gah this is making me crazy.

 

In other news, I'm hopefully close to getting a new MacBook Pro 15 inch retina display with 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM, 2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 CPU.
