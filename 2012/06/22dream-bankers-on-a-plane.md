_The bankers from the Lehman Brothers movie I watched last night were all put onto a plane and given neckties for their meeting, but as it came time to land people noticed the neckties were too small and wondered what they were for.  I noticed the plane was heading straight for a wall and realized they were safety harnesses and those people who knew how to use them could survive the impact of the wall and the plane.  The impact seemed imminent, but the plane slowed down due to mud on the runway and stopped short of the wall, and we all got out, but were surrounded by exo-political military forces because we had landed on an airstrip normally reserved for alien craft which could land vertically and didn't mind having a wall in the middle of the runway.  They all had guns so we explained that we were from earth, and they were like, "we know who you are, now get out of here and take your plane with you," but no one knew how to fly the plane as the pilots had jumped out before the landing._
