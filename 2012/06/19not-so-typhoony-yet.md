##21:18 Tuesday 19 June 2012

I made Lin join me playing in the typhoon.  She put on flipflops and a raincoat over her stretchy pants.  I put on a pair of swimming trunks and nothing else, though I did put a towel in our mailbox for our return.

 

Went to the river and splashed around in the water on the sidewalk.  Rode an abandoned bicycle a bit but left it there because it was happy.

 

Danced around in the water a bit then went inside.  Hopefully the wind will get stronger tonight so I can go out again!
