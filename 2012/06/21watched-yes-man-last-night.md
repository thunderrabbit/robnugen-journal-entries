Lin and I both really loved the movie; she loved it so much that she *almost* stayed awake through the whole thing!  We both thought the lead actress was incredibly attractive; I love her eyes, nose, freckles, smile, and apparent personality!  I thought she looked familiar last night, but couldn't place her.

 

[http://www.jinni.com/person/zooey-deschanel/](http://www.jinni.com/person/zooey-deschanel/) reminds me that I saw her in Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.  A-ha!

 

ps: I love [http://www.jinni.com/](http://www.jinni.com/) for movie recommendations.
