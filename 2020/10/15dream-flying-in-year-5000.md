<p class='dream'>Jezelle and I were exploring a construction area officially off limits but in an area where no one cared about.  I had been before and showed her a trampoline bed with a large mattress spring for a giant. She left the room to get her shirt which was outside and apparently someone saw her but she wasn't worried about it because the person didn't say anything.  We were walking outside together and I found a small handful of fabric that was hers though I couldn't identify its purpose.  Her hand touched my hand and I thought for a moment she was trying to hold my hand but she reached into her bag. </p>

<p class='dream'>Some people started chasing us so I flew up to get away from them, sad that I didn't have a chance to bring her but she caught up and I found myself blocked inside a large glass dome covering the whole facility/city.  It had large windows shaped like rearview mirrors in a brick wall pattern repeating over the while dome. I tried different ways to try to fly through the dome to get out but was unable, even though I knew I should be able to do anything in this space.</p>

<p class='dream'>I gently floated down to the astroturf surface and there were many people at a geology exhibit where there was a lava flow 3000 years ago in the 1950s, and the announcer was saying the had no idea who the people were who got the blessing of free land, but it was a time when they had no respect for the planet and people would just shoot guns at fossils instead of studying them so there was an exhibit where we could shoot a .22 caliber pistol at the rock just like they had on the old days.  The guide shot the rock near the target where there had been a hole shot completely through the rock.  He gave me the pistol, pointing the barrel "safely" up away from people and I immediately pointed it safely down away from people.  I aimed carefully at the target, lining up the eyesight on the barrel and pulled the trigger but it just clicked as there were no more bullets because the guide had fired them all.</p>

<p class='dream'>I asked if I could help reload and he said one of the staff was learning how to do it properly so I should let her do it.  She removed a plastic retainer with pliars after it was loaded and when I aimed the gun again, the hole was gone, replaced by some legalese like an EULA that we didn't read but just shot through.  I had a sense that the hole had been where the word "people" was now in the legalese. I slowly woke up while aiming the gun.</p>
