A month ago on routeplanner.com I planned about four more days of my walk to Niigata.  I took screenshots of those maps and will "soon" add links from my site to those maps.

According to my plan so far, I'm about one day from Dragondola, having gotten a day past a nearby bunjee jump.

Links coming soon?
