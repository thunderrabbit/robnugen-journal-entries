<p class='dream'>Seeing transactions from a meta level as I climbed different levels of a parking lot to see what parts of the houses underneath it that I didn't understand, I saw a man who had had the same assets but wasn't willing to talk to his sons why he had lost the assets.  His sons were simply curious and he was getting so angry like "stop asking me."</p>

<p class='dream'>Climbing down through some rubber padding and bright orange security ribbon, I planned to go tell my instructor what I discovered and woke up.</p>
