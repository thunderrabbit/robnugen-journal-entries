After getting off to a slow start I made pretty good progress on filming for marble track 3 today.

Ghrp has made it all the way down to the stage and has just cut the stick that reversible guy has been holding.  The two pieces already cut are still up in the air; I'm not sure how I'm going to get them down.

I had the idea to have candy Mama call for everyone to come help build the second bridge.  after she calls, the two brothers are going to run away to try to get out of work.  Pinky and mr. Green will come help, along with Dr sugar probably.

while they are working on the second bridge I will keep the stage rotating with almost nobody on it.  Once the second bridge is finished that will be the end of the 10th snippet which I have been working on for a long time now.

I'm planning to work on the track again tomorrow.
