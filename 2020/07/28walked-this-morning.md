It's interesting to walk past things from different directions and
then be like "oh I've been here before!"

Today was the day I found an unused, folded, crushed-by-car-tires
plastic bag in the parking lot of a convenience store.  I opened it
and allowed it to dry out over a 15 or 20 minute period while I
walked.  Near いなげや in 南生田２丁目 I wrapped my todo notebook
"one" in the bag to keep it dry in case it started raining again on my
way back.
