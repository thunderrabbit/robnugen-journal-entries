1. Very curious to me that I have been writing *less* in my journal
   while ostensibly having more time to do whatever I want during this
   COVID stuff.
2. After we did lessons
   online for 5 of the past 8 weeks, I just went back to JB School
   today for 4 lessons today.  I had the option of sitting behind a
   clear sheet hanging from the ceiling, but I felt claustrophobic
   behind it and just opted for where a mask.
3. I seem to have gotten a scratch on my eye from fiber from my
   mask. Very annoying.
4. I am planning to walk to Niigata.  Now that I have found a way
   across the mountains and found **Dragondola**, I am getting super
   excited about the walk.
5. I wrote an entry for George Floyd
