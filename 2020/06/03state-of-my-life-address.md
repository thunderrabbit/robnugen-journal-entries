1. Very curious to me that I have been writing *less* in my journal
   while ostensibly having more time to do whatever I want during this
   COVID stuff.
2. After we did lessons online for 5 of the past 8 weeks, I just went
   back to JB School today for 4 lessons today.  I had the option of
   sitting behind a clear sheet hanging from the ceiling, but I felt
   claustrophobic behind it and just opted to wear a mask.
3. I seem to have gotten a scratch on my eye from fiber from my
   mask. Very annoying.
4. I am planning to walk to Niigata.  Now that I have found a way
   across the mountains and found **Dragondola**, I am getting super
   excited about the walk.
5. I wrote an entry for George Floyd

6. After writing the entry, I saw some interesting evidence that the
   murder may have been faked, and lots of rioting has been amplified
   by paid shills and free bricks delivered to peaceful demonstration
   locations.
7. I have been visiting "my" tree semi regularly as a place to chill.
   Today I even did some planning for ConSwi scoring system.  Last
   time Tariq, Dipendra, and I met, I came up with a new way to
   calculate the scores.
8. In Bold Life Brotherhood, we are now in the month of June, focusing
   on RIGOR.
9. For AB, I have gotten rid of at least 3 singletons, and am down to
   2 remaining in the codebase.  I have not yet figured out how to
   convert `SiteHandler`, but `ErrorHandler` will be converted to
   non-singleton soon.  I actually did not notice `ErrorHandler` was a
   singleton because I had been searching for `extends
   \Pattern\Singleton` but `ErrorHandler` came from a different source
   and has its singleton aspects right in the class definition.
10. Mai has been hanging out with us occassionally since COVID; it has
    been great to have a friend living close by.  Richard moved first
    back to his home country and now they are waiting for Mai's visa
    to be approved.
11. While walking in the mornings, I found a neat house at the top of
    a hill which uses the shape of the hill to give a window to an
    otherwise underground room.
