I just walked to yomiuriland and took some pictures I'm very happy
because it's proving that my walk is definitely possible. I was just
thinking about some ways to kind of promote the trip with cards or a
story saying whiny got to because my shirt says. and maybe selling
shirts if you want to buy a shirt too and maybe where should the next
trip be that kind of thing. Having people be my navigator for a day if
I don't have battery as I'm planning each part of the route like each
day of the trip I need to start laying out the days so I know where
I'm going to go each day and have enough time for community feedback
on those plans as well so one first step is to get the maps up on my
website and two maybe have a peach section v eats own put a clickable
zone or something I don't know.

So then I opened my email to write this note and then found out the
fucking Prentiss died which is bullshit and I just saw him a few days
ago on messenger so I'm at the stage of denial unless this is fake
news in anyway why didn't a auto save my my note?
