I have a server (https://b.robnugen.com) dedicated to serving binary
content (as opposed to text).  Basically pictures (and some PDFs and a
couple of MP3s probably).

For some years I have been poking at the idea of being able to upload
from my phone *named* images, into specific directories.  (I can settle
for hardcoding the directory to make it easier to start.)  I have
recently found [MicroPub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Servers) and
beginning to grok that as a possible way to help solve this.

I have just found [Known](https://withknown.com/) which apparently
runs on Dreamhost, so I'm going to check it out.
