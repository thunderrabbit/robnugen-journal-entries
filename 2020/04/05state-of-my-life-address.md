Wow it's been days since I wrote.

1. There is only one topic, and the topic is COVID-19
2. As a result of "physical distancing" and "social connecting" many
   people and I have been doing workshops and such online.
3. I have not been keeping as up-to-date with my invitations, and at
   my most recent event, no one else attended.  I gotta invite people more!
4. Tonight was my last lesson (for a while) teaching Mutsumi.
5. Mai came over tonight to hang with Lin and I.
6. I am really impressed with Oren's ability to gather up a bunch of
   people to present things online during this nearly worldwide COVID
   Quarantine.

I just sent a Tinyletter newsletter with more details.  It is in my blog, but I am too tired to figure out the link now.  I guess here: [Getting myself out there](/blog/2020/04/11/getting-myself-out-there/)
