1. I'm kind of stalled out in doing Thought Leaders Business School stuff.
2. Today I finished Day 13 of 30 of my Design Your Day Livestreams on FB.
4. I had a great time at badminton on Friday; great to see Tomoko, Morimoto, and Saori (smash sensei).  Plus got to meet 
3. I had a great time at The Pink Cow 20th anniversary party on Saturday, hanging out with Lin, Rie, Carl, Michael S, Hiromi, Rita, Kasumi, and Traci
5. Apparently typhoon 15 was supposed to rain on us all day but hardly any rain yet.
6. Marcel said they are up to 28 named storms in the Atlantic, with concerns about Beta now
7. I'm supposed to be working on SZ's website but haven't done more than research yet.
8. Also need to do some more work on AB's website this month.
9. Also want to work on preparing the route for my walk in April.
10. I've just decided to ignore the anti-hype and embrace 5G for my next phone.
11. I went to the AU shop recently and didn't get a phone because they are not waterproof.
12. I should look at getting an open source phone, but I haven't sourced an open source phone supplier in Tokyo.
13. I thought it would be funny to ask how Santa Claus will deal with quarantine this year.  I was right. The question has already been asked and got some decent funny answers on quora
14. I recently decided to focus on the concept of Confidential Listening as my thing. I'm not a counselor nor a therapist, but I'm a good listener
15. I'm at 498 hours of [livestreams on Marble Track 3](https://www.marbletrack3.com/episode/).  I should get to 500 by next week.
16. Though I'm writing this on quill.plasticaddy.com I still haven't set it up to post directly to my live website.  I really should do that before I start walking in April.
17. Maybe should also get a GPS tag to track my progress.
18. Michael S signed up for TLBS so I want to be Accountability Buddies with him on that.
19. I recently set up a standing weekly meeting with Dad. So happy to finally get to chat with him regularly these days.  I wonder if we can get Fred in on it.
20. I haven't played Minecraft nor messed with Urbit in a while, but an still paying for the Vultr box on which I was running those. $6/month..
21. I sometimes pay $6 per *day* on snacks (white chocolate Galbo) and drinks while commuting.
22. Cripes I'm also supposed to be working on ConSwi, but haven't done much in a while.
23. I just keep getting annoyed that T and D keep focusing on all the graphics and shit when I don't care about any of that. I just want to get the programming side done to see if the game is viable or not.
24. FFS, the paperclips game has zero (*) graphics and is hella popular. (*) Okay, it has a logo of sorts
25. I've been using my waterproof Aquos SH71? for several years now (same model, third actual device). It has held up wonderfully, only needing to be replaced due to dropping and soaking in warm sea water.
26. I'm planning to lead a walking meditation walkshop in Shinjuku Gyoen on Saturday October 10th from noon to 2pm. I still need to announce it on Meetup
27. Shinobu and I did our 8th Your Art Matters (YAM) workshop this past Saturday.  It was a we-show.
28. Do you ever just need someone to talk to?   Someone with an empathetic ear to hold space while you get things off of your chest?  someone to ask introspective questions that help get to the root of the issue so you can break through and move forward with your life.  Try my Confidential Listening and see what insights you can get in a very short time. All the answers are within you and it just takes a competent guide to help tease them out. #copy
29. Wow I just discovered if I chill for a couple minutes in the empty waiting room (on Nambu Line in Noborito), I get a crowd free experience walking to the Odakyu Line.
30. Lin offered to pick me up tonight if the typhoon was too rainy to ride TJ Bike home.  Bless her heart. I love Lin so much like OMG.
31. It's been really outstanding to just be like thoughtful and stop being snippity toward her. Our relationship has gotten so much better because I accept her as she is and have stopped acting like an ass toward her.
32. She and Mikako are planning to go camping in October; I am invited but haven't checked my ohhhhh dang my walking meditation is the same weekend. Hmmmm.
33. I made first place in the Pearl League in Duolingo, by scoring like 1700 points in 7 days.  Now in the Obsidian League, the top scorer has 3300 points in 3.5 days.
34. I like to go to sogo every week, but I didn't go this past Sunday.
35. The cursor is acting strangely here on this page so I'm going to go ahead and send this now.
