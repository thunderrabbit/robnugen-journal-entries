1. I noticed the sound of today's date (March Fourth) is a command
   (March Forth)
2. I'm still in the middle of updating AB's backend site according to
   MLAPHP.  It has helped enormously with my confidence in making
   updates to the site.  Like OMG the book has paid for itself
   countless times.
3. Recently I got phan/phan installed on a local virtual machine and
   have been doing static code analysis as well.  It found hundreds(?)
   of critical errors, all of which I have fixed, some of which were
   long-lasting bugs that simply hadn't been triggered.
4. I've kinda stalled in moving Bold Life Brotherhood Tokyo forward.
   Sometimes I am just not sure what to do.  Well I mean I know I need
   to post stuff and such, but I don't know what to post that seems
   meaningful.
10. One thing to do would be stop playing Best Fiends.  It's a dang
    good game in terms of gameplay and dopamine hits, and wow what a
    time sink.  I am up to level 165.
5. I am on track for 36 workshops in 2020.  I have done 6 so far in 2
   months.  Two more are scheduled in March (walking meditation in
   Shinjujku Park and Your Art Matters); I need to schedule something
   for the end of March.
6. I just wrote to Giselle and Yuna to see if they wanna do another
   workshop together.
7. Weird I just spoke Japanese with a western-looking woman working at
   the convenience store.  She didn't switch to English so I didn't
   either.  Not sure if it's just me, but if we had switched to
   English, it would have felt like a wall had been lowered.  I don't
   think it is just because my Japanese ain't all that great.
8. Recently Lin has been wanting to buy a 2015 Forester.  I prefer to
   save money and pay cash for it but she wants to get it sooner and
   use credit.
9. I spoke with Clio from AirBnB who gave me some great ideas for
   getting my AirBnB Experience started, including lowering the price
   at first, adding more pictures, and adding more dates.  I started
   thinking about it though, and it's like I don't really want to do
   this; nevermind.  I am tempted to just delete the whole thing.
11. Dang my computer just dropped from like 40% battery to 0%.  I was
    not watching carefully but it just went to sleep and woke up with
    0% after I plugged it in.
12. That reminds me, I am in the market for a new computer.  I am
    thinking of getting a desktop to be my primary machine and clear
    this one of non-critical stuff.
13. All schools have closed in Japan for what I am calling Virus
    Month.  I hope it does not last for a month more but apparently
    there may be an announcement made by Prime Minister Abe next week
    that everything is gonna be shut down.
14. Our cat Jennie is apparently 8 years old.  Lin has relaxed a bit
    about her being outside after dark.
