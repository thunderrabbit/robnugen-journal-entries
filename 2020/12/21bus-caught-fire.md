<p class="dream">Riding on a bus going through some narrow curvy
streets that created a mesh of docks over water on the way to port
some kids stupidly got in the way of the bus and were nearly injured
but the bus driver stopped which caused overheating in the front of
the bus which caught fire so I informed the bus driver who started
spraying flame retardant on the fire to keep it from spreading while
the little kids ran away as they saw the black smoke coming from the
bus. Speaking Japanese, I told the bus driver more places where the
fire was burning.</p>
