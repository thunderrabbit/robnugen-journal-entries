1. I've ordered my new computer from System76.  After a delay too minor to stress over, it's apparently under assembly now.
2. I've started leading [Weekly Alignments](/weekly-alignments/) the first fourThursday nights each month.
3. I'm still teaching in Omotesando on Tuesdays, and plan to quit each time I head toward the lesson.
4. I'm really pleased with Marble Track 3 construction today. I had Mr Greene enter reflectively as he exited, and he's carrying El Banderín, a name I love, and hope makes sense en español.
5. Three men attended their first MKP Japan meeting last month and two that I know of plan to attend for the first time tonight.  Before COVID, we had approximately 1 new attendee every two or three months.
15. Recently (basically since we moved online) all of the attendees besides myself are men who have not attended the NWTA.
6. I'm still of the mind that whether or not this Corona virus is real the lockdown is worse on the population in terms of deaths and stuff than the actual virus.
7. I'm still using my Android phone so I'm thinking more and more about getting a new phone cuz this one gets slow sometimes and that's annoying.
8. I'm using micropub to write this initial journal entry but it still doesn't publish automatically when I click submit.  It's still sends it to my development domain plasticaddy
9. The other day was my first experience at Yuki's contact dance which I described at the end by saying "I'm in heaven."
10. before that I met Christian to play disc in Yoyogi Park before SOGO. Super great time hanging out with him.
11. I've made a first draft of my walking route to Niigata, but have yet to find hotels for most nights along the way. I haven't made any reservations yet.
12. I worked on AB just 8 hours last month and still need to send my hours in to Nate (they're officially due today).
13. I read some of the transcribed diary of Thomas Edison; curious to see how he saw and described the world.  How would he react knowing parts have been published?
14. Lin and I have been getting along wonderfully recently, mostly due to (her awesomeness and) my care taken to chill out my anger.
16. Until early last month we watched several of the Marvel Comics Universe movies in chronological order. We finished _Ant Man_ and are up to _Captain America: Civil War_.
17. I've augmented my Japanese KUMON study using Anki. Recently I've been memorizing a few intransitive verbs.
18. As predicted, I'm happier now after leaving the Omotesando lesson, and of the mind to keep doing them.  They are fun once I get there but don't make financial since to me, so I wonder what I'll do.
19. Currently I'm thinking I'll work there for a year before quitting.
20. Eight men including 2 new men attended MKP Japan's first weekly meeting of December.
21. I've been taking Dmitri's _The Inspiration Process_ course, and got from "I want more money and recognition for my heart work, but
    I get ignored instead" to "I want to be the expensive guy, but I get ignored instead."  Step by step.
