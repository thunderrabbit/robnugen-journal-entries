Okay yay!  A couple days ago I received my new System76 laptop running
Pop!_OS.

1. The first day, I installed a few things including Dragonframe, and
copied all my Marble Track 3 data for Dragonframe.  Also got signed in
to https://chat.pop-os.org/ and have received help from some peeps,
notably @derpmatt, @datapoke, and @mmstick 
2. The second day, I got
[Barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/) installed on old
machine and new machine so I can use my same keyboard and mouse and
smoothly control both machines.  So nice!
3. Today I started to dig into my Emacs setup. So far, I have gotten
to the point that I can type `C-c j` to (start the macro that accepts
title, N tags, and optional date so I can) create journal entries.
