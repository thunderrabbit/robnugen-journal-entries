Hanging out with Christine today, I chose to runes from a set which she got from Norway.

I had stated the topic is my offering in terms of my livelihood like workshops and such that I'm doing.

I first chose Raido and Tyr Reversed.

In Christine's notes they mean rhythm and victory.

This lends itself nicely to what Rin and I were talking about today: needing to consistently promote our workshops before they come.
