<p class='dream'>Walking barefoot 21 km to work</p>

<p class='dream'>9:20am </p>

<p class='dream'>Beautiful weather whistling oh happy day to myself</p>

<p class='dream'>10:07 a.m.</p>

<p class='dream'>I walked past Tokyo shoe store and the owner took a picture for me outside the store.</p>

<p class='dream'>I asked him to include the sign and he included half the English and half to Japanese so neither one is completely legible.</p>

<p class='dream'>But there is a big kanji that says shoes, which contrasts with my big feet with no shoes.</p>

<p class='dream'>I uploaded to Instagram the bottom half of the photo he took and planned to upload the top half of photo I took in three pictures from now.</p>

<p class='dream'>So I hope I remember to upload that photo after I find two more interesting photos on the way to work.</p>

<p class='dream'>I feel much more certain that I will find interesting things than I feel certain I will remember to upload the top half of that photo at the right time to align it on Instagram's three-wide photo list.</p>

<p class='dream'>11:37</p>

<p class='dream'>I chatted with Mohamed for an hour while walking and I'm now 2 hours and 50 minutes away from work.</p>

<p class='dream'>Great to talk to him about the meaning of life and the meaning of being a PhD.  but I right next to a road that's loud as heck when I'm talking to him so hanging up for now.</p>

<p class='dream'>12:07 p.m.</p>

<p class='dream'>I've walked 9 km now and have 12 more to go.  I'm beginning to feel some tiredness in my hips.</p>

<p class='dream'>13:07 p.m.</p>

<p class='dream'>I counted 1000 steps on my left leg and assume that's a little bit more than 1 km total.  There's apparently 8.5 km more to go and I'm still feeling pretty okay.  </p>

<p class='dream'>Under normal freaking chances I would take a break for lunch at this point and in this case I cannot because I have to get to work on time.</p>

<p class='dream'>But I'm just now made it to my original train line Tokyo Toyota line.</p>

<p class='dream'>13:15 p.m.</p>

<p class='dream'>My alarm just went off saying that I have to leave home soon to go to work.</p>

<p class='dream'>306 p.m.</p>

<p class='dream'>I took a shower at the internet cafe and I'm now in the final kilometer to the school.</p>

<p class='dream'>My legs are feeling pretty fine left knee is a tiny bit tired and soles of my feet are tired but all the joints seem fine.</p>

<p class='dream'>Phone battery is at 1% charge and I didn't really charge it but I talked with Muhammad for an hour..</p>
