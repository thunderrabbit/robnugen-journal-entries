TL;DR:  I walked barefoot 23km yesterday.

I started yesterday thinking Google Maps said it was 21km to my work.
By the end of the day, Google Maps said I walked 23km, so maybe I used
a different route.  Here are notes I wrote during the walk yesterday.


#### 9:20

Beautiful weather whistling oh happy day to myself

#### 10:07

I walked past Tokyo shoe store and the owner took a picture for me outside the store.

I asked him to include the sign and he included half the English and half to Japanese so neither one is completely legible.

But there is a big kanji that says shoes, which contrasts with my big feet with no shoes.

I uploaded to Instagram the bottom half of the photo he took and planned to upload the top half of photo I took in three pictures from now.

So I hope I remember to upload that photo after I find two more interesting photos on the way to work.

I feel much more certain that I will find interesting things than I feel certain I will remember to upload the top half of that photo at the right time to align it on Instagram's three-wide photo list.

(( I remembered, but I miscounted, and had to delete a photo (then repost it) ))


#### 11:37

I chatted with Mohamed for an hour while walking and I'm now 2 hours and 50 minutes away from work.

Great to talk to him about the meaning of life and the meaning of being a PhD.  but I right next to a road that's loud as heck when I'm talking to him so hanging up for now.

#### 12:07

I've walked 9 km now and have 12 more to go.  I'm beginning to feel some tiredness in my hips.

#### 13:07

I counted 1000 steps on my left leg and assume that's a little bit more than 1 km total.  There's apparently 8.5 km more to go and I'm still feeling pretty okay.  

Under normal freaking chances I would take a break for lunch at this point and in this case I cannot because I have to get to work on time.

But I'm just now made it to my original train line Tokyo Toyota line.

#### 13:15

My alarm just went off saying that I have to leave home soon to go to work.

#### 15:06

I took a shower at the internet cafe and I'm now in the final kilometer to the school.

My legs are feeling pretty fine left knee is a tiny bit tired and soles of my feet are tired but all the joints seem fine.

Phone battery is at 1% charge and I didn't really charge it except while I talked with Mohamed for an hour..

#### 15:15

I did it!
