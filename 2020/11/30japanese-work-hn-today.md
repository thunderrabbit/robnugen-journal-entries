Today I went to Japanese lesson at the 市民館.  It's nice that it's
close, inexpensive, and involves real people, but about half the time
the teacher is way above my level.  Today was one of the
above-my-level days, and I mentioned to Alina that the other teacher
is quite more understandable to me.  Alina said the same thing was
true at her Japanese school.  The male teachers were hard to
understand and the women were easier to understand.  I don't quite
think it's that in this case; this teacher just tries to power through
everything, as if his target is to finish a certain number of pages,
regardless of student comprehension.  I did mention to him several
times in class I
didn't understand.  At one point he remarked, "it's impossible, but
let's continue."  Something like 無理だけど続きましょう。

After the lesson, I worked on AB and fixed the mount points of the
back fender on TJ Bike.

Just about to go to bed, I opened up Hacker News to find some typed
transcripts of
[journal entries by Thomas Edison](http://ariwatch.com/VS/TheDiaryOfThomasEdison.htm).
So amazing that he was so wrong about things as "simple" as dandruff.

    It has just occurred to me that the brain may digest certain
    portions of food, say the ethereal part, as well as the stomach.
    Perhaps dandruff is the excreta of the mind — the quantity of this
    material being directly proportional to the amount of reading one
    indulges in.  A book on German metaphysics would thus easily ruin
    a dress suit.

What have we got wrong now?

In the comments,
[oscare asked if anyone is keeping a diary these days](https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=25247266).
Thank you for asking!  The question inspired me to post my entries
from the weekend and write this one from today, including my reply to oscare:

    I hand wrote my journal from about 1987 to when I moved online.  I
    flirted with the idea of maintaining both, but that did not last
    long.  For aspiring journalers, always write the full date
    including year.  Probably write the time of day and maybe day of
    week to help give context to future readers.  Do not worry about
    backtracking if you skip a day.  Just write starting now,
    otherwise the backlog will paralyze you.

    That reminds me I haven't written about today yet.
