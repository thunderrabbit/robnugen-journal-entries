<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p class=date>5:49AM Thursday, February 13, 1992</p>

<p>Yesterday I bought 3 stamps for a dollar from Lani, the beautiful
girl who was in my Calc II class.  Somehow I'm going to go out with
her.

<p>Danielle is not so mad at me anymore, so maybe I'll be able to go
out with her, too.

<p>Laura and I went to the I-45 Drive-In to see FreeJack and Double
Impact.  FreeJack was cool, but not fantastic.  The theater is going
out of business, and will be shut down starting in March.  There were
only 1.5 other cars that watched our movie.  Laura and I kissed a lot
and didn't watch Double Impact.  I fingered her and she fondled me a
little bit.  Then we talked about it and she said that this was going
too far.  So I'm not going to do it anymore.  I swear I won't.

<p>On February 5, (Wednesday) Maggie and I had our pictures taken for
the yearbook.  Very cool.  The (female) photographer was quite smiley
and took care to make my "THINK" on my Thinkshirt legible.  I
appreciated that.

<p>Last night, Forest and I talked for a while.  I told him what I
feel about breaking up with Tammy and why I'm self centered lately.
He said "Don't look at me." at one point because my gaze was
overpowering.  Cool.  I've been working on being able to look into
people's eyes when I talk to them.  Now I can do it.
