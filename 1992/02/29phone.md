<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p class=date>Saturday, February 29, 1992 (Leap Day)</p>

<p>My new phone number will be 522-7280 starting by 5 pm March 6,
1992.  Today at work (Kroger), Alan asked if I would be interested in
going out with someone that worked with us.  I asked who and he said
Cheryl.  Cheryl has a nice smile and seems pretty fun and flirtatious,
so I said, "sure. have her ask me."  He came back a bit later and said
she was too embarassed and that I would have to ask her.  So I hung
around with her during her break after I got off work and we exchanged
phone numbers.  I'll probably call her as soon as Tammy leaves here
tonight.  Cheryl is 19 or 20 I think.  I intend to tell her straight
out and up front what I'm like.  I do not want commitment or anything.
I'm not a guy to spend lots of cash on a girl, but I will show her a
good time.

<p>Spencer is in heat and rawwling it through the whole house.

<p>I talked to Bruce (property manager) today, and he said I can just
pay $350 tomorrow since Tammy is moving out.  Cool out.

<p>And the ultimate: Laura and Jodi need a place to stay during the
summer!  Oh my gosh that would be so cool.  I am really interested in
kissing Jodi.  We'll see what happens.  Jodi said jokingly I'll have
to give her a back massage every night if she moves in with me.  I was
like "Ok!  No prob."  That would be excellent to have them here.
