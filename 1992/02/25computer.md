<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p class=date>Wednesday, February 26, 1992</p>

<p>Tammy is moving out a week from tomorrow.  Right now I'm backing up
the hard drive so I'll have a copy of all the software.  I'm going to
have to take the computer apart and reconfigure the drives and stuff.
I intend to keep this case and LED display with the speaker switch.
Tammy is taking the huge 143 meg hard drive and the 286 mother board.
I'm getting the sound blaster and the 360k floppy and the XT
motherboard.  (C Drive backup is done)

<p>I'm going to get at least a 386 when I upgrade.  I'll be glad to
have Tammy out of here.  No more of her laundry or her crap all around
the house.  I still need to call and transfer the utilities into my
name.  I think I'll do that now.  Dude.  I just now did the electric
and gas.  No problem.  I simply need for dad to cosign for the
electric by March 4.  She's moving March 5th.

<p>WAYNE'S WORLD!! PARTYTIME!! EXCELLENT!!  I just finished the D
drive backup. I'm going to shower and go to school now.  Dude.  I'm
going to get rid of the fish and put Mickey in the huge tank!  All
right!  Later.  Love Rob
