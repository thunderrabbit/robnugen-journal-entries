<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p class=date>Wednesday, February 5, 1992</p>

<p>I screwed up getting Tammy after her trip.  I was at the airport at
9:13AM (The correct time) but when I looked in my planner, it said
11AM.  So I fucking waited for 2 hours until 11AM.  At that point, I
found out that 9:13 was correct and well---- Finally I was able to
contact Tammy at home.  She had gotten a ride with Lynn.

<p>During Tammy's trip, I stayed with Laura all 3 nights.  I enjoyed
that bunches.  The first night, she wore a teddy.  Dude.  I had never
seen one before, much less slept with one.  So we made out a lot the
first 2 nights.  Not so much the 3rd night.

<p>Tammy had fun on her trip.  She did it with Bonnie once, and the
next night she had sex with Bonnie and Rick at the same time.

<p>We've been getting along realatively well lately.  I've been
kissing Laura and Tammy doesn't care.  She's been out each night
messing around and I don't care.  In fact, lately I've been pretty
self centered.  I have a pretty illogical and sometimes inconsistent
reasoning for what I do or who I kiss, etc.
