<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p class=date>Saturday, February 8, 1992</p>

<p>Today I worked at Kroger from 9 to 5 since then (It' 10:25pm) I've
been doing homework, dishes and catching up on the budget.  I've got
my tuition for this current semester covered.  I got about 112 dollars
for 24 hours work at Kroger.

<p>I've been trying to contact someone from the dorms to go play
frisbee with them.  But no one has been there so I just keep on doing
homework.  In Calculus, we're doing vectors, which is incredibly easy
after Dr Bao's class.  Cool.  I got the first two homeworks on chapter
11 done on one sheet of paper each.

<p>I recently recycled 610 pounds of newspaper and got $1.22 for it.  Cool.

<p>This past Tuesday and Thursday, I've been at the dorms while Laura
went to work in the evening.  So, she gave me her board card with
which to eat.  Thursday I got 2 entre's, a cheese burger, pudding,
corn, cake, 4 or 5 glases of milk, 2 bananas, aplle, 1 Cap'n Crunch
cereal bowl. Dude.  I love the buffet style food there.

<p>On Monday & Wednesday, I confirmed a date with Danielle for
today. (Saturday) Then Thursday evening, Maggie said that Danielle was
mad at me for some reason.  Then on Friday morning, Danielle said she
could not got out with me.  I asked her why, and she said she'd be too
embarassed??!!  Man... she didn't seem too incredibly interested in
discussing it, so I didn't pursue it.

<p>I'm in the process of collecting cotton to send to Tara on the
Castle of Dreams BBS.  She makes stuffed animals, and I have access to
<em>lots</em> of cotton from work.  So I'm sending her a big ass box
of it.

<p>That's about it.  Later
