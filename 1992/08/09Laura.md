<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>7:17AM, Sunday 9 August 1992

<p>Laura spent the night over here and she has just left.  She would
like for me to come over one last time, but I fear for the van's
health.  I wish I could be there to see her off... I told her that I
would write to her.  I'm tired-going to sleep...  When I wake up, it's
clean the house time

<p class=date>1:30 AM

<p>"Today" I cleaned the house including mounting the power strip for
my computer on my comuter desk, and screwing the screws into my wooden
chair.

<p>Today (Monday 10 Aug '92) I have to do laundry and start my full
time work schedule for the week.  Erg. (10-6:30 eachday)

<p>Good night
