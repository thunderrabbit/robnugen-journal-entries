<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>7:45PM Friday Aug 14 1992

<p>I talked to Jami last night, and I enquired about her real name.
Maggie told me it was longer, but I didn't know how to spell it.  Now
I do.

<p>When Irma the Good Morning America lady called, I noted she had a
thick Brooklyn accent. Cool.  She said, "Tomorrow, between 10 and
10:30AM <em>Your</em> time, call the 1-800 number and dial extension
6484, and ask for Grace.  Ask Grace to give you my local number in
Houston. I'll be at the Lancaster Hotel.  Call that number and we'll
set up an appointment so that I can meet you and see what you look
like."  Before that, she had left a message on my answering machine,
"call the 1-800 number and dial zero. Ask the operator to connect you
to my home phone number."  It's wild trying to contact Irma.  Busy
busy busy.. ..
