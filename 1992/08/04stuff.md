<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>11:40PM Tuesday, August 4, 1992

<p>Today Heather and I got up way early and went to UH to get
financial aid stuff done and to help me find a job.  We located a cool
one: work as a gopher for Good Morning America 3am to 1PM August 17
through 21 while the convention is in town $50 per day.  I called the
lady and she'll call me back tomorrow.

<p>I also worked on my budget program.  It's coming along much better
than last time.  I'm totally drawing it out and designing the objects
carefully before I code anything.  Marcel called and we are going to
House of Pies tomorrow at 10:30PM.  Laura called and I'm picking her
up from the airport tomorrow at midnight.  Marcel called again and I'm
going to Astroworld with him on Saturday.  That's the day of the
Castle of Dreams Bad Film Fest.  So we are Astroworlding in the AM and
I'm going to the Film Fest in the PM

<p>I also got to talk to Jami, Molly's blonde friend up in IL, who was
born in Canada.  She was fun.  I'm going to write her a letter soon.
Later
