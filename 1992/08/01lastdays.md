<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>9:35PM Saturday 1 Aug 1992

<p>I did get 3 days of pay at Kroger.  Tomorrow is my last day.  I
also got to work register 1 today.  Coolness.  Chris Greer, who does
the scheduling, gave me 6AM to Noon tomorrow.  Cool.  Then he wrote
out across the rest of the week, "Have a good life, Robmeister."  Heh
heh.  A customer today said while Chris was right there, "See you
later alligator, After awhile crocodile, after supper mother fucker."
HA!  That was funny.

Today I read several chapters in Wishcraft.
I think I need to redetermine my goals... Barn
raising is quite a cool technique.  I shall
use it with Heather.  I feel confused about
what my goals are..

<p>Oops - I made the previous two lines backwards.  Oh well.  I'm
going to do Blue Wave now.
