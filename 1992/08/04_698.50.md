<p>"Today" I got a check from Nishika for $698.50.

<p>RIGHT!!!

<p>That is totally cool.  I shall deposit it and $100 cash tomorrow.
There is a totally beautiful girl visible in the next building.  She
has on a white long T shirt and was sitting at the table eating and
reading.  She's blonde.  I watched her for several minutes, but it
seems she's left the room for good.  How do I meet her?  Hmmm.
