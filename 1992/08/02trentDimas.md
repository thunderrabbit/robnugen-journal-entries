<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>9:30PM 2 August 1992 Sunday

<p>Today was my last day at Kroger.  I saw Angela (Pauline) from House
of Pies.  I said, "Is this Angela from House of Pies?"  She was like,
"Oh my God" and started fixing her hair back a bit.  It was funny.
She said, "and this is Robert from House of Pies."  I hadn't
recognized him since he shaved his beard and grew a moustache.  A lot
of their stuff didn't scan for some reason... Heh heh.

<p>I went to Heather's today and we had a JAM session.  Tuesday we are
going to UH and we'll get my ass a job.  We'll try the Learning
Support Services (LSS) where they do tutoring, and the job bank and,
Central Site Computing for a job for me.  We'll also look at financial
aid for HL&P kids...  It's lightning & storming a lot.  More rain than
anything though.

<p>Today I happened to turn on the Olympics to men's high bar
routines.  <b>Holy Shit!</b>  They are so <em>bad</em>!!!  Doing shit
like 1.5 flips over the bar and triple back flip dismounts.  Check
this out:  American Trent Dimas stood for a moment and moved his head
through all the maneuvers in his routine.  At the end it looked like
he did a triple back and stuck the landing perfectly.  I told Molly
this as he did the head motions. (She was on the phone with me)  I was
right.  He did his whole routine kick ASS and he Stuck his triple
back.  He got 9.875 and won the gold.  RIGHT!!!
