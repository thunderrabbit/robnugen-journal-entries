<p>This is my last weekend to work at Kroger.  Laura and I went to
Kroger last night; I had a meeting there about the security
checkpoint.  She read magazines until I was done.  During the meeting
I tickled the shit out of Cheryl, on whose chair arm I sat during the
meeting.  Cool sentence.  Not.  I didn't totally tickle the shit out
of her, but she was begging me to stop.  Very fun.  today, I'm the 3rd
checker to come in.  Carol = 7-3 Cheryl = 8-4 me = 9-5.  I might get
to be on express. That'd be cool.  I'm in the mood to start working on
my budget program.  I think I will get 3 days worth of pay at Kroger.
I worked Thursday last week.  Word.  Later.
