<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>7:38 AM Tuesday 11 Aug 92

<p>Last night I went to Bizmart looking for a binder to hold some of
my small computer manuals.  They only had 1 inch binders, so I went up
to the front desk and totally flirted with Mary, the long brown haired
girl who was up there.  She was quite helpful and spent several
minutes helping me look through a catalog to find the binder I need.
I stood around and talked with her for a while, then I went and looked
at some office supplies.  I didn't find what I wanted, so I came back
and flirted with her again.  I prompted a questioning phone call from
her supervisor after I spent fully 2 minutes watching the minute hand
on the clock move.  Heh heh.  I then filled out a bizmart Business
discount card, for Marcel & my MR Laboratories.  Cool.  I listed us as
a fabrication company, since we're going to make Temp-o-spoon.

<p>Then I went to Soundwaves and purchased the CD of Two Nice Girls. I
had never heard their stuff, but they are based in Austin, and I saw a
couple of T shirts advertising them when I worked in Kroger.  They are
mostly vocals and accustic guitar.  They are also totally lesbian.
Cool.  One of the songs describes how much worse it is to love a man -
"I spent my last 10 dollars (on birth control and beer.)"  I've
listened to it once.  Today is day 2 of my full time week at St
Joseph.  Later
