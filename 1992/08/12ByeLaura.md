<p>Day 3 of St Joseph Hell Week.  Last night I went to Laura's and
helped them load her truck.  I was lots of help.  Laura said I
probably made it go twice as quickly.  We were up till about 1AM, at
whcih point her dad went to bed, and I crashed on her floor.  She woke
me up at 2am and we moved to the couch bed.  As we lay there and
cuddled, I told her that I Loved her as much as I've Loved any of my
girlfriends.  She was happy to hear that.  We woke at 6AM and she
walked me out.  We stood between her mailbox and the moving van to say
our last goodbyes.  I told her "I meant what I said last night."  She
said "thankyou."  We hugged tighter.  She said, "it will be fun
keeping in touch via internet."  I agreed.  She said "Parting is such
sweet sorrow."  We unhugged and I pulled the pineneedles off my feet
that had stuck there.  I said "see you later" and walked to the van.
I got home at 7AM and crashed until 9AM.
