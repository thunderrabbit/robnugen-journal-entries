<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>9:20Pm Friday August 28 1992</p>

<p>Yesterday I took notes while watching the Simpsons.  Bart wanted a
machine gun for his birthday so "we can hunt gangs, spell out things,
or bring in the new year!"</p>

<p>Bart's uncle: "Aren't you excited to see what it is?"</p>

<p>Bart: "Not really.  We peaked inside while you were in the john."</p>

<p>Today was my last day at work.  RIGHT!!!  They bought lunch from
Popeye's Chicken and they got me a cake with several different colors
air brushed on the icing.  I took the whole rest of the cake home in
my bag.  I kinda had to fold up the box to make it fit.</p>

<p>Right now I'm about to go to the dorms and go to House of Pies and
spend the night and then go to the VAX and then have a picnic at 1PM
and then who knows what in the afternoon and then pick up Laura from
Hobby airport at 9PM.  Later</p>
