<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>7:20PM Wednesday 12 Aug 92

<p>Dude.  Irma Norris called me today to basically accept my
application to work for Good Morning America next week 3AM - 1PM each
day.  Total Total coolness.  RIGHT!!!  I'm going to meet her sometime
on Friday to fill out paperwork.  They wil be broadcasting from Hyatt
Regency in downtown.  She said there is no telling what I might be
doing.  I may drive to & from the Lancaster Hotel.  I may be helping
in the studio moving cameras or whatever.  Dudeness.

<p>Jamica Susana Alana Thornton is Jami's real name.
