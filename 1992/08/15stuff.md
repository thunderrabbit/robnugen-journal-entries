<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>Saturday 15 Aug 92 9:20 PM

<p>This morning I woke up at 4AM and did laundry.  Damn! I can't
believe it was today.  At 10:30AM, I went to the Hyatt Regency to meet
Irma Norris about my Good Morning America job.  She's quite a nice
lady, and I believe all will work out great.  She showed Fred (not my
brother, another runner like me) and I where the cameras would be and
where the interviews would be, etc.  I also got a nifty ID thing that
will be cool looking in my scrapbook.

<p>After that, I went to Kroger and bought posterboard to make a full
semester calendar, and I got my paycheck and flirted with Cheryl,
Carol, & Dorschell.

<p>Then I bought 2 rats for Mickey to eat.  He ate them both pretty
quickly.  Then I went to the hardware store and got 2 washers and a
bushing and I fixed my window handle knob on the van.  Then I went to
Pierre's and borrowed his OS/2 installation disks.  I backed up my
entire 3 logical hard drives onto my tape backup. Then I played with
windows for a while and now it's time for bed.  Belinda (volunteer
from the pharmacy) just called to say, "HI"  Later
