<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>12:15 AM Friday August 7, 1992

<p>Wednesday at House of Pies, Marcel, Will & I played frisbee in the
parking lot.  Then James showed up and we 4 played and then we went in
to eat.  Jodi showed up after a while and joined us, and then Laura M
and her friend Gina (sp) came.  Gina had braces, and she sat next to
me.  RIGHT!!!  We flirted a little during our meal.  At 11:30PM I had
to leave to pick up Laura W at Hobby airport.  As I was leaving, Gina
asked if I wanted her to escort me out.  I said 'sure.'  However, Will
was blocking her from getting out, and she didn't want to make a big
scene, and I didn't want to make a big obvious flirtation scene so she
ended up not escorting me out.  If she had I was in such a mood that I
would have stated bluntly, "I have a braces fetish.  May I kiss you?"
I would have done it.  I swear.  Oh well.  I left and got Laura and I
spent Wednesday night at her house.  I spent all Thursday there, too.
It was fun, and I called Castle of Dreams (we're currently building a
giant wooden roller coaster on the cloud) and read a Foxtrot cartoon
book.  I just got home at 11:30PM and returned Marcel's call.

<p>"Tomorrow" we might play nuclear war at Laura's depending on if I
can call her and how late she wants to do it.  I'd love to go, since
Gina might be there.  But it can't be too late, 'cause Saturday is
Astroworld!  RIGHT!!!  If I see a girl at Astroworld with
braces.... watch out.

<p>I'm going to meet Marcel and Alise and April there at 9:45 AM.
We'll play until we drop or until I have to leave for the Castle of
Dreams Bad Movie Fest.  Total Cool.  I hope I'm not too totally heart
broken by leaving Astroworld that early.  I haven't been there in 2
seasons... I wonder if I'll kiss either April or Alise?  or both?
Will they have braces?  Will they be too young?  We'll find out.
Later
