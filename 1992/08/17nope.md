<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>10PM 17 Aug 92

<p>I've been up since 2AM.  I'll be up at 2AM.  GMA was great.  I've
logged it in my day planner and I'll put in here later.  I can't see
the page since my contacts are out.  I didn't piss all day today -- 20
hours.  The toilet water was beer colored afterward.
