<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p class=date>10:30AM Friday, March 6, 1992</p>

<p>Tammy is gone.  I am late for school right now.  Yesterday after
school I helped Tammy move.  Between classes, I played on the
escalators with Molly and Jeanine.  During class, Jeanine and I wrote
notes and flirted.  After class (before physics) Jeanine and I had
lunch together and determined that we both would enjoy making out
together.  Cool.

<p>In addition to escalators, I climbed a tree down by Agnes Arnold
underground, shimmied up a slot up Agnes Arnold, threw Jeanine's books
onto balcony outside Assembly class window.  We all went to House of
Pies.  Me Molly Jodi Jeanine.  Laura did not go (she was at work)

<p>Today I went to mom's church rummage sale and got an ans machine
and telephone and 3 plates and cups and my end table that I built and
2 foam matresses from our camper to use as a bed.  I also got two wall
pictures, one original signed by Picasso(!) And a sketch of Houston
skyline, 1980.  Cool.  Later
