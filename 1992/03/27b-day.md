<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>Friday March 27, 1992

<p>My birthday was great.  After we shopped at Target, we went to
Herman park area and walked around.  We walked around the fountain
that is in the circle intersection of Montrose and Main Street.  We
walked around the lake beside the zoo, and made a side trip to the
park near the zoo and Ben Taub hospital.  Then Jodi went to work and I
played at home.  After she got back, we went to Marble Slab for my
birthday party.  I posted an open invitation to everyone on the
Castle.

<p>Incredibly enough and <em>wonderfully</em> Tara and Windy the Wise
came!  They go by Cathy and Walt in real life.  It was so great to see
them and I was so happy that they came!  We talked until about
Midnight or 12:30, then Jodi and I went to bed.  She had to get up
early to go work at McDonald's, so we set the alarm for 5AM.  She got
up and the phone rang.  It was McDonald's: "Don't come in to work. We
don't have a uniform for you."  Dude.  So she hopped back in bed with
me.

<p>Thursday we went back to Marble Slab and then to Kroger to get
milk.  We also went to Niko Nikos for lunch.  That was great.  I got
Jodi to call the Castle of Dreams. Her handle is !Kung Baby.  Cool.
So she left 2 messages to different people (Jack Dracula and
All). Then she worked and I played on the computer.  After work she
called the Castle back, but hadn't gotten any messages.  After that we
backed up the hard drive.  Jodi sat with me the whole time.  I enjoyed
that immensely.  I told her all about the files we were backing up.
After that was done, we went to bed and engaged in wild sex.  It was
great.

<p class=note>(four lines skipped)

<p>After that we crashed back into bed.  I looked at the clock and it
was 3AM!  Oh my gosh... So we conked out and I woke up at 8AM like
normal.  I took the computer apart, and with a little bit of trouble,
I got Tammy's working again. (At the time, it seemed like a lot of
trouble, but I don't remember now what the big deal was, so I'll just
forget it.)  So Tammy took me to her house and I set up her computer
there.  While we were there, we determined why we broke up.  It was
basically because she would never do the little things that I wanted
her to do, such as wear bright red lipstick, or take showers with
me. She said she knew this was true, and that if she could do it all
over again, there would be some things that she would change.  That
sent me to tears for a bit, and she held me.

<p>Then I cam home and got <em>my</em> computer back to working
again.  Cool.  That's really making a long story short, but I'm
tired.  After Jodi's work today, we joined the people from my work at
the pharmacy at Birraporetti's.  Cool.  It was for a free pizza party
since Birraporetti's screwed up last time we were there.  It was also
a birthday party for me.  Cool.  They got me a big set of glasses.
Excellent.  Then Jodi and I came home, and we are Blue Waving on the
Castle.  Later
