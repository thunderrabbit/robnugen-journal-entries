<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>June 12 1992 3AM or so

<p>I can't see shit cause it's dim and I don't have my glasses on
anyway.  I need to design an outlet cover for electrical wall sockets
that can close and be slush with the wall and only have a little thumb
notch showing both where it is and how to open it.

<p>Yesterday, I got my response from Monner and Grandad they sent me
1500 dollars holy shit that's wonderful.  And dad gave me the 3000
that he promised.  Very cool.  I'm going today to get my huge paycheck
that will result from me working 52 hours last week.  I'll deposit a
big honker deposit in my account and Tuesday I'll go computer
shopping.

<p>Yesterday, Tammy called me at work from my house.  She said that
she "couldn't stop thinking about me, so she decided to come over and
ride me."  Oh my god - my toes started going right there at work.  I
had to take a raincheck, though.  She said she might let herself in
some night and we'll fuck like crazy.  Excellent.  Later
