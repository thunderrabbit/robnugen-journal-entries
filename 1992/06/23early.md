<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>June 23 4:53AM.

<p>I've been up since 7:30 AM.  I did laundry, went to work, came home
and played on the computer some.  Then I've been writing messages for
the Castle of Dreams for the past 6 hours.  I finally got them done,
and now I'm trying to stay up until 5AM when I can upload them.  (4AM
- 5AM = mail hour) Mail hour fro BBS.s No humans allowed.  I'm going
to try again.  I have to be up in 6 hours to take Ma and Jan to the
airport.  Later.
