<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>Monday, June 1 1992

<p>I talked to Psycho Robbie today and I'm going to go to the radio
station tomorrow early and give him some cool feelings.  I worked 10
hours today.  Holy shit - dad called while I was at work and said he's
going to give me $3000.00 for school and shit.  Holy crap I can't
believe it... I got a note from UPS and Nishika Camera Company - my
stuff from the winning prize shit is here 3-D camera and jewelry.
Dude!  That is like most triumphantly excellent.  They were unable to
deliver it, so I'll try to call them tomorrow and pick it up maybe.
Later
