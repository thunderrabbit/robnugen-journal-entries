<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>Wednesday, June 3, 1992 11:13PM

<p>Today I worked for (12) twelve hours at the hospital.  Dude.  We
were so busy yesterday.  We <em>almost</em> got caught up today.
(after staying 1.5 extra hours)

<p>Lucy called this morning and thanked me for last night.  hmm- looks
like I told you that.

<p>I intend to sell the jewelry and 3-D camera that I got from
Nishika.  The camera for $300, and the jewelry at the best price I can
get pawn shop.

<p>I am really really ready to get my computer.  I should have a ton
of money amassed after getting $3000 from dad and working all these
hours and hopefully a lot from my "2 Grand Prizes" from Nishika.  If I
win 10 grand, I'm going to get a monster 486DX Maximum speed, plus
coprocessor, Super Super VGA, 38,000 baud modem, modem dedicated phone
line with 64 or so megs on the mother borad and a bigger & faster hard
drive plus tape backup - It will ROCK.  Right!
