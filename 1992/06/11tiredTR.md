<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>12:10 AM Thursday, June 10, 1992

<p>Today at work I wrote out the following message:  (this is abridged)

<p><blockquote>Thunder wakes up after 59 hours of sleeping by his old
room.  A crowd gathered around him to see what was up.  It turns out
he was abducted and made to rewrite the code for the super chess
computer, Deep Thought.  In COBOL.</blockquote> 

<p>That is so funny.  thunder was all crying just thinking about it.
I haven't been able to upload the message though.

<p>I called Peter (cousin) today up in Ohio, I assume.  We talked
about old and new times.  Very cool.  We talked about girls and school
and dorm stories, etc.  I had 3 calls while he and I talked: Lucy,
Jeanine & Fred, (and maybe Molly) He was like, "Damn!  You got women
like crazy!"  I wish, but it was cool to let him think that.. So I
called Jeanine back and we talked for 30 minutes and now Molly is
supposed to call back any second.  I wish she'd hurry up and call,
since I want to try to upload my message.
