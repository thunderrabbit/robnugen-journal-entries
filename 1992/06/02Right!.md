<p class=date>Tuesday June 2nd 1992 9:10AM.

KRBE and gave Psycho Robbie the cool feelings that I had written.  He
couldn't give me a tour, due to "strict rules" which I can
understand...  As I was driving out of the parking lot, Barsky said,
"Robbie's got something here.  A listener came in the rain and brought
some cool feelings.  These are really funn.  (Darian Hunter laughing
and agreeing) Yeah we should hire this guy."  Robbie said he'll
broadcast them tomorrow as listener cool feelings.  Dude.  I was going
Right!  Alright!

<p>I don't know if I ever told you about "Right!"  "Right!" will be
the new catch-all word.  The new phrase that sweeps across the country
if I have my way.  Use this word when something excellent happens.
Bark it out: <b>Right!</b> We just need a couple of rugby players from

something they'll shout "Right!"  Very cool.  Then Saturday Night Live
will pick up on it and *boom* across the country in no time.
