<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>3:35 AM Sunday, June 27, 1992.

<p>I got my computer working.  It Rocks.  RIGHT!!!  It is incredibly
faster than my other one.  Flight Simulator has smooth scrolling
effects while flying and everything.  I've got 4 megs of memory, 2 of
which are being used as a disk cache.

<p>Yesterday after work, I rode Bruce's bike from my house down
Montrose to Allen Parkway, turned right on Allen Parkway and rode to
the place where they filmed a taxi commercial, then back down Allen
Parkway all the way into River Oaks where it turned into Kirby, and
then followed Kirby through River Oaks till it hit San Felipe.  I took
San Felipe to Heather's apartment and stopped there for a while to get
a drink.  Then I took W Gray down to Montrose and then right on
Montrose to Herman Park.  I rode the equivalent of around all of
Herman Park 1.5 times and then went back via Montrose and Marble
Slab. Marble Slab was a mistake; it made me <em>so</em> thirsty.  So I
stopped in Kroger and walked Bruce's bike back to the water fountain.
I only had shoes and shorts on.  They were incredibly busy, heh
heh.. Then I went home and wrote messages for Castle until I went to
bed at 10:30PM.  Molly called just about then and we talked for an
hour.  Very cool.  I woke up at 3AM to go shopping for about 10
different items, and to say "hey" to Matt, the guy who won 50 bucks in
the lottery.  (He worked from 11PM to 7AM today) Kroger door said
"closed till 5:30AM" but I went in anyway and Gail graciously let me
shop in spite of the fact that she was doing a sales report.  Cool.
So I got my stuff and here I am.. Now I'm going to bed again.
