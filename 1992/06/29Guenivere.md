<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>Monday, June 29, 1992 8:20PM Saturday

<p>We did inventroy in the pharmacy from 8AM to 11:30AM.  Then I went
home and got ready for the Great Super Soaker War Castle of Dreams
Party.  I brought 3 gallons of gatorade and a lot of carrots.  As I
arrived, Windy the Wise came out and watched as the wetness of the
carrots caused one of the gatorades to drop out of the bag and cleanly
break the entire bottom off the bottle and be emptied in 1/2 second.
We talked and chilled inside for a while until the GSSW started in the
pool.  I went out there and it was great.  The war was mostly mayhem
and fantastic.  While we were at the pool, Trikshot came up to the
fence, "this is Guenivere.  This is Thunder Rabbit."  She was
beautiful.  So so so pretty.  I was totally smiling as I offered to
help her carry stuff up.  She was fun.  I went back to the pool and
requested that she join the fun.  She sat up on the steps and watched
at first and then joined us.  I was totally carefully flirting with
her.

<p>At one point, I was crouching by the pool filling up the water tank
to the gun I was using.  Night Mage came up behind me and pushed me,
so I braced my hands on the edge of the pool and pushed my legs out
away from the pool so that he lost all his leverage.  I didn't go in.
Dude.  2 of Windy & Tara's kids, Speed Racer and Snow White were
there, trying often to push me in.  Each time, I would grab them and
throw them in.  Finally Speed jumped onto my back and Snow pushed from
one side- so I was leaning over to dump Speed in over my head and to
pick up Snow and throw her in when someone pushed me from behind.
They both fell in and I went in on top of Snow White.  Bonk.  As I
oriented myself, I noted that my leg had gone through the arm hole of
Snow's one piece bathing suit.  Whoops. So as she was standing up, I
got my leg out and grabbed the strap and put it back on her shoulder
where it belonged.  Cool.

<p>We all played and played.  Guenivere hopped into the hot tub soon
after I did, and Shadow Thief and Poet and Speed Racer joined.  That
was fun.  I sat underwater for several seconds (probably one minute).
Fun.  We also did some chicken fights.  That was enjoyable.  As a
base, I held my partner up (Speed Racer I think) through 4 other
teams.  Cool.

<p>Once, Jack Dracula was having trouble with his water gun.  I
watched this happen:  he pointed the gun up and looked down the barrel
and fired it at the same time.  PPsssshhhhh right in his face.  Oh my
gosh that was hilarious to see his expression.  He was so embarassed
and thinking "I don't believe I just did that."  I laughed and told
him, "there <em>will</em> be a message about that."  and patted him on
the back.

<p>We went inside and ate and then played Castle Charades.  My team
was Windy the Wise, Black Magus, Thunder Rabbit, and Guenievere.  I
sat beside her.  We played for about an hour.  I did "ain't she sweet"
and I can't remember the other - But I did them both successfully.  We
broke the game for a while to get drinks and such.  When I came back
into the room, Shadow Thief was brushing Guenivere's hair, and she was
in <em>Heaven</em>! Oh my gosh I was so stunned and jealous.

<p>Apparently it was very obvious that I was jealous by the way I was
watching her.

<p>The game resumed after a while, and I got to sit beside her again.
I rubbed her back some with my left hand, and then invited her to sit
in front of me so I could use both hands.  She said no and actually
asked me to stop rubbing entirely, so I did.

<p>The game ended and we went into the room containing the Castle and
played in there.  I came back into the living room and noted Guenivere
on the couch, so I lay in the middle of the floor.  A few seconds
later, I heard a flop of papers land by my head.  I looked, and Laura
had tossed her law school catalog to me.  Dude.  I noted her
initials.  Cool.  I told her, "cool initials."  She smiled, and I got
a tad bit of courage and decided to sit by her on the couch.  I almost
sat just on the edge, but I decided, "that is stupid.  Sit beside her
like she's a normal body and be her friend."  So I did.  We talked
about her school thoughts and prices and how cool the schools were.
(either she'll go to UH because it's good and inexpensive and
convenient, or to Chicago school because it's a great school)  As we
sat, I found out that she's going to <em>graduate</em> school.
Whoah.  The girl is <em>smart</em>.  I was glad that I chose to be her
buddy.

<p>Someone announced that someone else had spent 30 minutes so far
writing an otherwise short message to Guenivere.  So we went in
there.  On the other computer, there was a cool word processor on, s/
(*) so I typed, "Thunder Rabbit was here."  and then my tagline
"... Oh, and here is the key to the restroom."  and then "~~~
Bluewave/Max " A few minutes later, Shadow Thief gave me a hard copy
of it, "109 point font" he says and handed me two sheets of paper.  He
had printed it out on the ink jet printer.  Cool.

<p>Black Magus and Shadow Thief prepared to leave and I walked them
out.  Shadow asked, "Why were you giving me those weird looks [while I
brushed her hair]?"  I told him it was because I was stunned and
jealous.  I told him that I was in lust with her at first, but then I
decided to be her friend.  I told them that I intended to apologize to
her for flirting so much with her, but that wasn't quite the right
word.  "obnoxious flirt." said Shadow.  Perfect.  I told him "thank
you. that is the term I shall use."

<p>Black Magus looked up at the sky.  A second later he looked back at
us and said, "Damn!  I have to go to Brenham tonight!"  "What the
hell???" we responded.  "I can't see the stars for these darn lights."
Ha.  we laughed.  Then I looked up at them and said, "Damn!  I have to
go to New Orleans tonight!  And be back my 11 AM!"  Then Damn... to
Jupiter  Damn ... to Alpha Centauri.. then "Damn!  I have to
Circumnavigate the universe tonight!"  Funny.  They left. and I
returned to the Castle. (!!)

<p>After a while Trikshot, Guenivere and I walked Guenivere to her
car.  She was in her car and Kirt and I both obviously wanted to talk
to her.  In her words, I looked like "a classic image of a young boy,
carving an arc in the sand, hands clasped behind his back, asking a
girl to his first dance."

<p>So we both wanted to talk.  She had to leave, so I just told her,
"Laura, I apologize for being an obnoxious flirt."  She smiled and
said it was Ok, & that she didn't mind at all.  Cool.

<p>After that, Kirt and I talked for about 2 or so hours until almost
3am.  We talked about Guenivere and what he wants in a girl and what I
want and computers and everything..

<p>Sunday morning I left a private message for Laura on the Castle.  I
gave her my address and phone number.  She called Sunday at about
10PM.  We talked until 2AM.  We discussed everything that occured at
the Castle Party and laughed about every inch of it.  My jealousy, and
flirting and coments that I had made, ("You know you've got me by the
ears.") the fact that she didn't flirt back to much becausekrit was
there.  So funny.  We flirted like crazy over the phone.  She gave my
a verbal back massage at the very end, just to ensure that I would
have sweet dreams.  Wonderful As we hung up, she said, "Goodnight,
Snuggle Bunny."

<p>Monday I was dancing all day at work.  I was ecstatic.  I was
singing and carrying on; everyone knew I had a new girl.  4:30PM came
and I raced home to see if Laura had called.  <em>She had come
by</em>.  There was a note in the mailbox saying she had come out to
see if she could find me.  AAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!  I read the note about 20
times.  Oh my god she had been right here!  She called me at about
10pm and we talked till about 1AM.  We confirmed a lunchtime meeting
today at 1PM (6 hours from now )  I behan to describe my back massage
method on her.  "Is this phone sex?"  she asked.  "If you want it to
be." She begged me to stop after a while because she couldn't stand
just to imagine it, but not feel it.

<p>We discussed genealogy, and she will show me around some archives
some time.  Cool.  She was impressed and pleased that I was
interested. 

<p>At the very end, she said, "Goodnight, Snuggles."  Oh - I asked her
what her favorite snuggle position was.  She describe one of my
favorite, too.  Me snuggled in behind her, mathcing her body
countrous.  Word.  RIGHT!!!

<p>(It's now Tuesday morning (I started this entry last night.)  Laura
called at the (!!) page 109) See the "s/" on page 108 by the (*)?  that "/" was
designed to be an "o" but the phone rang as I was writing it.  It was
Tammy.  I jerked when the phone rang.  Whoah!!  Funny.

<p>"Animals are not spare parts."  apparently read the sign of some
animal right protesters in response to a guy receiving a baboon
liver.  I just heard that via Barsky on 104 KRBE.  cool.

<p>I decided to give Castle of Dream names and real names.

<p>This morning I woke up at about 5AM because the stupid fish tank was so loud.  I went in there, and noted that the tank was only half full.  Holy Shit.  It turns out that over the night, one of the hoses had come loose and was siphoning the water onto the floor.  Damn...  I filled the tank partway back up and I'm letting it be oxygenated and lose its chlorine and stuff.

<p>I'm going to nap some more.

<p><b>Comment:</b>
<br>Dude!  I just wrote this totally long-assed post - and the system just ate it when I hit the escape key.  Who wrote this BLOGish software anyways?!?!<br>
<br>
Finding your site, and finding the Castle posts was just too great an event!  Jo and I had been talking about the Castle with the kids lately (we have handles of Deek and Nim in a game and had to explain where the handles came from) and I called Victoria to come up and see your post.  (Jo's concerned with her reading any more of your adventures from back then.)  Just the other night, we were all in the car and we started talking about the Castle again - and I started going over our visitors.  Ryan liked the name, Thunder Rabbit, amd Victoria asked if I'd talked about you before.  I remembered then, that I used you as an example of why she needs to wear her helmet when she goes blading.  I also told her about the time I tried to push you in the pool and how your handstand out of it was the most awsome feat of athletic skill I'd ever seen. <br>
<br>
I found your site while searching for the Castle - I had hoped someone thought of it well enough to write something somewhere on the net, but no hits.  Looking for Thunder Rabbit finds video games.  Looking for Jack Dracula gets the stories of some California tatoo parlor (that's the problem with getting your handle for a Gibson novel).  I couldn't remember Gary's handle (Scout Seven) so I searched ofr his real name, found some bicycle events that he must've ridden in, and found your journal entry about sliding on the ice with him in Hermann Park.  I looked up your e-mail address from your domain registration, and sent you the note before being sure that you are Thunder Rabbit.<br>
<br>
Last night I told Jo about finding your website (actually conversation was more like - "What was Thunder Rabbit's last name?  I thought I found his website, but I'm not sure.").  I had to do some shopping (supposed to be for meds for her cold, but also got the champagne and strawberries for tonight - 13th anniversary!)and when I returned, Jo had found your site and found all these old entries for the days of the Castle.  <br>
<br>
Wow, and if only the "more years" link worked correctly on your site, Google might've searched these older issues too, and I'd have found you before you headed off on your adventures.<br>
<br>
Jo and I are now living in Sugar Land.  For a while we had the old apartment and an apartment in Dallas (I rebuilt all the computers/networks and stuf for Addison in '97 and '98), but when my Dallas gig was up we decided it was time to get a house - and the kids were ready for school so here we are....  A couple nights ago Jo and I went to the open house at the Middle School where Victoria will be going - feeling the tug at the heart strings as she grows up.<br>
<br>
I remember in July of '93 turning 30 years old, out of work with Jo also out of work, the Princess at home and the Prince en route.  Suddenly I felt all the pressure of my family relying on me to be dependable about work and making an income and everything else.  I know that I sacrificed just about everything in the next several years as the Castle died from inactivity to make it in my career - and I made it.  But I think back to those parties and to how few people we know now - seems like the cost was kinda high.<br>
<br>
I miss you guys.<br>
<br>
Jo did remind me that somewhere I still have the videos from the Castle parties (including the mistletoe cam, and also the one with the movie of you and Gary holding your breath in the hot tub) and so I may have to get them converted to DVD.  After Jo and I read your post about the Christmas part, she stunned me by bringing out the stack of poloroids we used to make the poster, and we went over all the pictures.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your kind thoughts and warm memories served up on the Internet.  I'm not far enough along in the "Story of Rob" to know how long you will be gone - but I have the impression it will be for a while.  Just know that when you return, you owe Jo and I a visit.<br>
<br>
With warmest possible feelings,<br>
Your friend,<br>
James Crossman, Night Mage
