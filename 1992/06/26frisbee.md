<p class=date>Friday June 26, 1992 10:10AM

<p>Last night Marcel, Steve, Me, Fred & Jodi met at the House of Pies
on Westheimer.  We played frisbee for a while in the parking lot
waiting for Laura & James & Casey to show up.  Frisbee ended when Fred
almost took out a big-ass window of a restaurant.  We ate & laughed
and it was great.  I got a load of ice cream on my strawberry rhubarb
pie.  Cool.  Then we split, except for Marcel and Steve and I, who
went to Transco tower to play frisbee.  We pretty effectively
disturbed several couples who were making out of benches.  There was
even a couple laying down (fucking?) on the grass.  Cool.  We played
until we were darn sweaty and then parted ways.  This morning I read
more of The Chronicles of Amber, which Fred brought home from dad's.
It's a cool book.

<p>Just now I was remeniscing about old times and I suddenly thought
of Maggie and I on my bed facing eachother with my arm on her side and
shoulder and we were talking and smiling.  I miss Maggie.  I miss her
smile.

<p>So I just now called her 10:18 AM.  Very nice to hear her voice.
"Yeah!  I want 10! 15 hours of sleep at night!" says Maggie in her
cute voice. "It's vitally important that I get it," she says of Tiny
Toon card number 65.  Now it's 10:48 AM.  I just got off the phone.
