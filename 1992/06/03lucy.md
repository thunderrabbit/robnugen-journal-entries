<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>12:20Am Wednesday, May 3, 1992

<p>I went to Lucy's today and rubbed sunburn gel on her naked back and
ass.  Very cool.  We didn't do anything or even kiss though.  Dude
I've received my 3-D camera and jewelry from Nishika.  I think I'm
just going to sell it, though.  The picture sample they sent me is
pretty cool.  Holy shit I'm tired.

<p clas=date>8:39 AM same day.

<p>Lucy just called to say "Thank you" for putting the lotion on her
back.  I told her that I enjoyed doing it.  Right now I'm recording
Barsky show - Psycho Robbie is about to do Listener Cool Feelings.
Dude.  So I'm going to record them and make a tape of Cool Feelings by
Psycho Robbie
