<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>2:40 AM Wednesday June 10, 1992

<p>Today I installed Turbo Pascal 6.0 and Turbo C 2.01 on the computer
and ran stacker to make it all fit.  I called Lady Di's bulletin board
and chatted with her for 2 hours about.  Our chat turned to sex for a
while and she hinted at being interested in having sex with me.  I
don't know what will happen.  She's 45 and has a boyfriend.  But we
flirted and talked about her wearing a birthday suit to the Castle
Super Soaker Party.  She seemed Ok with that.  I left a message on her
board asking for a female roomate (on the board) and she said a girl
named Velvet Box (!) would be interested in rooming with Thunder
Rabbit.  Cool.  We'll see what happens.
