<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>10:10AM Tuesday, May 19th 1992.

<p>Monday I worked 2-8:30 then I helped Bruce paint Susan Conte's
apartment.  That was cool, since she is the lead singer of the band
<em>Eyes and Ears</em>.  She gave me one of their CD's.  Dude.  It has
6 songs on it, which I played straight through twice last night while
doing dishes.  

<p>After Maggie & I went to bed, Tammy called all upset at about 2AM
because she coudln't bear to have sex with a guy she had been making
out with.  I told her there's nothing wrong with that, and that she
was fine the way she is and not to worry about it.  Maggie lay awake
while I talked to Tammy and after I hung up with Tammy, Maggie said I
did a good job with Tammy.  I really appreciated that support from
Maggie.

<p>This morning, (Debra) work called & asked if I could come in for
Emilio at noon.  I told them I would come in as soon as possible after
my Dr appt at 10:30.

<p>Speaking of which, it's 10:15 and I'm going to see Dr Bonefas about
my breast lump.  It will be cool if she cuts it out.  Later
