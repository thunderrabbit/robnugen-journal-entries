<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>Memorial Day Monday May 25, 1992 8:41 AM.

<p>Last night I had a dream that

<p class=dream>I was at the airport, and a skycrane helicopter
descended and picked up 4 people, each with a HUGE umbrella over
them.  These umbrellas must have been 10 or 12 feet in
<em>radius</em>. 20-24 feet diameter, (Duh).  Then there was a problem
and 2 umbrellas crashed and came tumbling, so I ran over there and
talked to the two girls that fell.  They were Ok, and I somehow knew
them (probably supposedly from Rallies, since I just talked to Karina
last night) So we talked for a big and I flirted with one and then we
planned to go swimming.

<p>Then I woke up and had a huge hard on so I jacked off and imagined
Noelle coming over and me fucking her.  Now I'm going to get busy:
laundry, recycling, and a few phone calls. (BBB about the company that
said I won 3-D camera and NCNB about my loan application)  Later
