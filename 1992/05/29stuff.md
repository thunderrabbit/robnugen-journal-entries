<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>Friday May 29th 1992 10:45 PM

<p>Today Psycho Robbie had his wisdom teeth pulled out.  I called him
at the radio station and told him it (surgery) was no problem.  I also
told him a Cool Feeling: When you're at the dentist and the beautiful
nurse has her fingers in your mouth - that's a Cool Feeling.  He said,
"how about when you're in the dentist's chair and you hear the drill
in the persons mouth in the room next to you - that's a cool feeling."
Dude I wrote him some more and mailed them today.

<p>I may start a charter membership in the Penthouse Book and Video
Club, they send catalogs and I choose what I want to buy.  Cool.  That
will also put me on some sex mailing lists.

<p>This whole week I worked 10 hours per day.  Ugh.  My head hurts
right now, too.  But my bank account will feel great.

<p>Today I started my <em>WishCraft</em> exercise book.  I will get
what I want in life.  Sex, money & computers.  Later
