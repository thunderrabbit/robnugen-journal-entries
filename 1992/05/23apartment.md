<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>Saturday, May 23, 1992 10:52 PM.

<p>Today I worked at Kroger until 6PM.  I got to be on the express
register because of my surgery.  That was cool.  When I got home,
Maggie had made some sweet & sour beef.  It was excellent.  Then she
and John went to his <em>Bilby's Doll</em> opera, in which he plays
french horn in the orchestra.  I went over and helped Bruce paint
Hal's apartment and Susan's apartment for 3.5 hours.  Now I've helped
him 5.5 hours total.  He said I'll get 8 bucks per hour, so thats $44
off my rent this time around.  Cool.

<p>Forest called today.  He's leaving (for real) for California.  He
says he still loves me and that he's running from me.  Pretty weird if
you ask me.  Anyway, he won't give me his address, so that takes a
load off my head.. Right now I don't really care if I never hear from
him again.

<p>Maggie and John should be home from the opera soon.  Cool.  We
might go out to Marble Slab.  That's about it.  Later
