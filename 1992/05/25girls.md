<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>11:15 PM Monday May 25th 1992

<p>Today I recycled 58 pounds of lids from the pharmacy and 17 pounds
of aluminum cans.  I got $5.61 in exchange.  Dude.  Today I met Jodi
at The Container Store and we walked to the Galleria for a bit, where
I bought a book for Kiera entitled <em>What Makes You Thank Teksuns
Tawk Funny?</em> Then we went to my house and then to Marble Slab,
where I requested a double serving of ice cream: apple-n-spice flavor
and vanilla bean flavor plus 2 scoops of m&m's (tm).  That was great.
Then we went to see Lethal Weapon 3 at the huge Cineplex Odeon (sp)
down the street.  It was as good as the first 2, but not better, as
Lucy said.  Now I'm here waiting for Tammy to come spend the night
because it might storm tonight.  She said no sex, though, so I jacked
off already. (Didn't get anything from Jodi.) That's it.  Later
