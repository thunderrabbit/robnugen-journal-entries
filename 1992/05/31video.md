<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>11:30PM Sunday, May 31, 1992

<p>After work I went to Fred's and we played with Char's video camera
and made some crazy home videos around the house.  I carried the
camera around and ran around and did the "close call airplane" bit and
stuff.  We loaded Fred's stuff and moved him over here.  He's got his
junk in the livingroom and I'm going to bed now.  I've got to wake up
early and go do laundry before a (probably) 10 hour day at St Joseph.
Later, and richer - Rob
