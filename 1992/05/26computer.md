<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>11:35PM Tuesday, May 26, 1992

<p>I worked 11 hours today at St Joseph.  At one point I was getting
really mad, but it was OK overall.  Tomorrow I have a follow up
appointment with Dr Bonefas.  Think I'll have enough guts to ask her
out to dinner?  We'll see.  Wouldn't that be cool?  I wrote to Monner
and Grandad today requesting a loan for my new computer.  I told them
(accurately) it would cost 1259.50 (386DX 40 Mhz & 8megs memory,
Midsized tower case and 200watt power supply, SVGA monitor and card &
Harddrive card & I/O ports.)  I didn't ask for the whole amount, but
just whatever they could afford.  In return I'll pay $50 per month,
plus a nice long letter about my life at the time.  Cool beans.  Later
