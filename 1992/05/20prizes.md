<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>10:45AM, Wednesday, May 20th 1992.

<p>Today I got some mail out of my mail box: "Congratulations Mr Robert
Nugen, You hav won at least one of the following prizes:" Cool!  So I
called the 800 number and gave them 4 security numbers.  Anyway. I
have guaranteed won a Nishika 3-D camera ($330) and 14 Karat gold
jewelry ($680) and (2) two of the following six prizes:

<ul>
<p><li>1992 Chrysler Lebaron or $10,000 cash (I chose cash)

<p><li>4 Round trip airfares for 2 people: NY, Boston (Kiera!), LA,
San Fransico

<p><li>$2,000 cash

<p><li>3 Round trip tickets for 2 people Orlando, Lake Tahoe, Las Vegas

<p><li>$1,500 cash

<p><li>32 inch TV or $1,500 cash (I chose cash)
</ul>

<p>Dude! I also will receive a 5 year membership with the Platinum
Card = 50% off hotels and such and trips to (Freeport Bahamas and
(Alcapulco or Cancun)).

<p>Ultimate!  However, I had to let them charge 698.50 to my VISA
account.  If I don't win the cash, I'll sell the tickets.  If I win
only tickets, I'll go see Kiera in Boston (definately) and sell the
rest (probably).  Right now I'm going to Nationsbank (NCNB) to apply
for a loan for $2000 for my computer.  Later.
