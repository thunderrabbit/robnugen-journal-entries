<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>6:21 AM Friday May 22, 1992.

<p>I'm in Tammy's car on the way to the hospital.  Cool.  So this is
it.  If I don't ever write in here again, then I died, so you can end
the movie, "Life and Times of Robert Nugen" here.  Later Love - Rob
