<p>Yesterday (today) my dad and I fixed the van brakes.  They work
great now.  Then I went to House of Pies with everyone.  We took 7
seven(!) people in Molly's car, so Jeanine and I (both) together rode
in the trunk.  Cool.  We didn't kiss or anything as she was not in the
mood.  We got funny looks from people at House of Pies who saw us get
in and out of the trunk.  Later
