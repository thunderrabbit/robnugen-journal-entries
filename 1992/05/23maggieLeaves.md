<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>11:50 same night

<p>Maggie & John just got back from the opera thing.  I was sleeping.
I hugged Maggie as she got some candy out of the fridge.  I walked
down there with Maggie and John and Maggie got into the truck with her
TCSC box in her lap.  I gave her a hug and kissed her hair against her
neck as I inhaled one last breath of Maggie for the rest of the
summer.  (I also caressed her leg.)  "Drive carefully and call me" I
said.  "See you in the fall," said John.  "Ok. Bye-Bye" replied Maggie
in the voice only she can produce.  Fuck.  I nearly died of loneliness
over Christmas vacation.  What am I going to do for the whole summer?
