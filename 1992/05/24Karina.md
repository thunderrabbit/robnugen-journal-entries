<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>11:35PM Sunday May 24, 1992

<p>Today I worked from 10 to 6PM.  Quina at work still won't give me
her phone number.  On a whim, I called Karina in Austin and talk to
her for the first time in 3 or 4 years.  We talked probably over an
hour.  She's moving to 3000 Beverly in about a week.  I'm going to
have a big letter for her ready to go.  Later
