#### 12:25AM Thursday 8 October 1992

"Today" after school I did my digital logic lab write up and
I finished 2 of my LISP functions. I cuddled with Maggie for about an hour and talked to her

I went to Marble Slab with Molly, Maggie, Patricia, & Judy at 10:30PM. Patricia wore red leather pants.

"Tomorrow" I'm going to school early to VAX. I really hope to see Lane.
She opened her letter to me with "HI, Sweetie!" (Shit. I just told you that)
OK, so you can tell it made my day in a big way.
I'm sure I will kiss her.

Oh - Jeff (Poet on Castle of Dreams) called me at Molly's. He took notes as I dictated a letter to him
describing what Thunder Rabbit is doing. As I was talking to him, I had my head on Molly's floor and my
legs on her bed.

Molly unvelcroed my shors and said, "Maggie, look," to Maggie, who was sitting at Molly's desk.
When Maggie looked, Molly lifted my underwear. Maggie says she didn't see anything, "or else [she] would
pummell Molly" Those twins are crazy--
