#### 1:40AM Monday 5 Oct '92

Today I painted Doug's bathroom and change the oil in the van. Then I went to the VAX to meet Linda at 2PM.
While there, I met Lane, who wears braces. Excellent!

Lane wears braces, and in fact, she just got them put on. She's 21, and will wear them for 2 years. Perfect!
So I helped her with her program and she helped me with my program. Then we exchanged some mail messages,
including an invitation for her to play frisbee with me. She accepted, and we played frisbee out by the aluminum people.
That was so excellent. She had to go home after a while, so I walked her to her car.  Then I went to Sara's to study.
I didin't study due to hunger, so I brought her to my house and ate and then studied digital logic for 45 minutes
