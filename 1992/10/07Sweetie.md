#### 12:30AM Wednesday 7 October 1992

"Today" I got to the VAX really early with the hopes that maybe Joni would be there
in need of my services. She was not there. I wrote to Lane a nice letter thanking her for plaing frisbee with me.
After school, I played with Kim some and I played frisbee with Celeste.
Today was the day I borrowed socks from Fred so I could go to Bowling.
I met him by chance while I was en route to Bowling. Amazing. I said, "Fred, give me your socks." Cool.

When I got home tonight, I called the VAX and I had received 2 mail messages from Lane.
She opened with "HI Sweetie!" in one. Excellent! So I wrote her back and gave her my 24hour hotline phone #,
and I asked her to meet me after her Thursday class. We'll see what happens. Later
