<p>ALRIGHT!!!  Excellent!  Dad came over and we finished pulling the
carburetor apart.  We then rebuilt it and put it back in the van.
PRESTO!! It worked perfectly!  We are BAD.  It cost us about $10.99 +
10 dollars worth of carburetor cleaner.  My best price otherwise was
$100.  Dude.  They wanted to charge me 100 bucks HA!  I am a stud
mechanic now.

<p>AND I was playing Blockout today.  My favorite level is 3X3X18
deep, Basic set.  (That has the following pieces)

<p>I normally start on level 4 and I got a high score of 64000 on
12-27-91 or so.  Today I started on level 6 and got to a score of
71000 or so and I had the whole grid basically clear while on level 9,
the top level.  Dude.  I was doing excellent.  Then it went up
<em>another</em> level.  I looked at the level indicator expecting to
see "10" I was surprised that there was a level 10, since the level
indicator only has 1 digit.  Check this out.  It showed a skull &
crossbones!  Dude!  I was majorly impressed.  So I got the highest
score, the ultra highest level, my carburetor fixed and I am BAD.
