<p>The van needs to have the carburetor rebuilt.  That's what the
Downtown Auto Care Center says.  They are the one's who replaced my
timing chain on the van.  Dad doesn't think they know what's wrong and
that I'm getting the run-around.  Sigh - I wish everyone was
trustworthy.

<p>I made my appointment for my first Sperm donation for Monday the
6th.  If I don't cum before then, it will be almost exactly 100 hours
of sexual abstinence for me.  Dude.  Well, check you later
