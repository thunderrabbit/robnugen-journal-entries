<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p>Last night I spent the entire night at the dorms.  I slept beside
Laura.  We made out a lot.  This morning, she let me use her board
card to get breakfast.  That was cool.  I met 5 dudes in assembly.
Mike, Sam, Hassan, Sanjay & Rick.  Cool.  Sam was in my assembly class
last semester, but he obviously dropped, too.  On the way to class
after breakfast, I threw a banana to Steve Avery, who was walking
toward us about 50 feet away.  He didn't catch it, ans Sam, who's name
I didn't know at the time, stepped on it unknowingly.  Funny.  After
school, I made out with Laura a bunch, and we also went to the
American Cafe to eat.  We got some cool UH napkins there.  When I got
home, Tammy was in a great mood until I told her I got a hickey from
Laura.  She was pissed for a long while, but got over it, and we
fucked.  I get to sleep in the big bed tonight.  Later
