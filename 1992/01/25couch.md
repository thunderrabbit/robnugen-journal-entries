<p>Recently I came home and Tammy was horny.  I kissed her and she
said, "you kiss differently." I told her I had kissed on Laura.  She
stopped for a full five minutes.  Nothing.  Then, "You may sleep on
the couch tomorrow."  So that's it.  I slept in the big bed with her
that night.  Last night I got home late & crawled onto the couch.
After work today, Tammy said, "As far as I'm concerned our
relationship ended when you kissed Laura."  So that's it. (again...) I
was sad & mad at first, but now (2 hours later, I'm like, "Oh well."
I'm going out to the dorms now.  We're going to play frisbee.  I
finished my Discrete math homework. Later
