<p>A whole slew of people came to the party.  I learned everyone's
name.  Let me get them all down here: Devin, Adam, Caleb (The original
members (Remind me to tell you about Smelg)) Sarah, Tanya, Shannon,
Bryan, Mike, John, Greg, Keith, who knows... I'll have pictures.

<p>Right now we are discussing Smelg.  That's the name of our new
music group.  We will have some weird ass songs on there.
