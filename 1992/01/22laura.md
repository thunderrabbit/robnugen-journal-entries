<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p class=date>Wednesday morning</p>

<p>Yesterday was the First Day of school.  Maggie is in all 3 of my
classes!  Heather is in Physics III with us.  I talked to Laura.  It
turns out that she was crying because she just needed to talk instead
of make out.  She's upset about Kim since Laura spent all her time
with Kim one year ago.  Then Kim disappeared for a semester or 2, and
now he's back, and expects Laura to spend all her time with him
again. Laura reminded me that she is a person, which I had forgotten.
She said she wants a happy medium between kissing and talking.

<p>After school, Laura and I saw Beauty and the Beast.  I was
dissappointed with the ending.  I liked the Beast better as a Beast.
Then we went to Transco Tower and to the Duck Pond, and to Bookstop
and to Randall's (to get Ben & Jerry's chocolate chip cookie dough ice
cream) and then to Herman Park, where we parked and ate ice cream and
made out.  I got a little too rough for her, but I was aware that I
might be, so I asked if she was comfortable.  She said no, so we
created the word pickles to indicate that we are not comfortable with
something.  Pickles is like me and Tammy's ear holding.  Later
