<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p class=date>5:37AM Thursday Jan 30th 1992</p>

<p>Tammy is not mad anymore.  She's leaving for Colorado to see/fuck
Bonnie from the BBS.  I hope they do sex eachother.

<p>Laura and I had planned to sleep in my bed while Tammy was gone,
but Tammy said no.  That kinda sucks, but I'll abide by it.  Later
