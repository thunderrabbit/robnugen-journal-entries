<p>I did not make the sperm donor society.  The doctor said my
family's genetic history was not cool enough.  Shit.  so I was in a
bad mood for a while after that.  Tammy and I had a relatively
important discussion about finances and our future and whether or not
we'll allow eachother to fuck and suck other people.  We decided we
would be a great couple if we didn't live together.

<p>The carburetor is still in pieces here.  Dad is coming over
tomorrow to help me work on it.  Later
