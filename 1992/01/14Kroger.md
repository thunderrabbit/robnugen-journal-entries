<p class=date>14 January 1992</p>

<p>I applied for a weekend position at the Kroger on Montrose a few
days ago.  Now it's Tuesday, January 14, 1992.  A guy called today &
asked me to come in for an interview at 4:pm.  It's 3:30pm.  I forgot
his name, though.

<p>The Kroger meeting went well.  I've almost guaranteed got the job.
I shall go to a training session on Sunday.  I met with Christopher.
We talked to probably 20 or 25 minutes.  He also attends UH.  He said
no problem; he will give me 16 hours each weekend, and only weekends.
So that's cool.  Also today, I talked to Bruce & he said I could cut
the lawns around the apartments for $90 per month.  Dude.  so that
means I'll be doing fine financially.  cool.  Let's see: 16 hours *
$4.65/hour = hmmmm I can maybe save $150 per month.  Okay, let's see.

Kro  148    Rent 375
StJ  500   Phone  50
Grass 90    Elec  15
             gas  10
          cargas  20
            food 100

     738  -      570 = $168

<p>Dude.  I can deal with this.  so if my numbers do work out as I
planned, I'll be doing ok.  Not fantastic, but ok.  Enough to keep
myself entertained.

<p>Also today, Pierre & Heather came home.  We went out to Chili's.
After that, we went to their apartment, where they showed me tour
stuff, and Heather told me all about everything.  I really enjoyed it.
At one point, Heather asked how Tammy & I are doing.  So, I told her.
I got kinda shakey for some reason, and short of breath.  I told
Heather that I was shakey, and she hugged me.  I really enjoyed the
hug.  She said, "you're a good guy, Rob."  Oh how I appreciated that.
We talked about implications and stuff, and she was shocked & a bit
sad.  I'm glad I told her, though.
