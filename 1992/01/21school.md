<p><h1>First Day Of School 1992</h1>

<p class=date>January 21st, Tuesday 12992 7:35AM.</p>

<p>Sunday after work at Kroger (which was easy.  I remembered most
stuff pretty handily.  Carol helped me learn a bit.  I met the
manager, Mr. Garvin, and he seemed impressed that I'm a computer dude.
He asked if I could help put some (simple!) computations into his
Lotus 123 worksheet.  Heh Heh - "this will be easy," I told him.  So
hopefully that will work out.  The 8 hours went by pretty quickly.
More on this later.)  I went out to the dorms.  We went to 2 Pesos,
and I had to mooch for money again.  Kim (the guy), Laura's friend
from 2 semesters ago is back.  I don't have detailed info on him, but
I will soon.  Anyway, at the end, Laura and I made out on her bed from
about 2:45 to 5:30AM.  At the end, though, as I was leaving, she was
crying.  Oh shit.... I had to go though, so we couldn't talk.  Man oh
man... I don't know if she's falling for me or what.  Today we're
going to talk during our lunch at 11:30.  Later.
