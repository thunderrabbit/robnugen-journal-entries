<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>Saturday 1:45AM 5 Sept 1992</p>

<p>"Today" after school, I tried to study for a while in the Fine Arts
Building library.  I rented TRON and we all watched it in Molly's
room.  I sat between Cindy M & Molly on Molly's bed & flirted a little
with both of them and I also flirted a little with Maggie, who sat in
front of me.  After the movie, Marcel, Molly & I went to Kroger and to
Randall's and completed Operation B.S.  B.S. = Banana Sticker.  We
collected a total of 49 banana stickers on the botton of my frisbee.
We now have 78 stickers, and we're going to put them on Greg's yellow
'banana' car.  At Midnight, I went to the OB desk and talked to Judy.
Caleb & Audrey walked up and Audrey was as smiley and flirtations as
ever.  I told her, "Come here." She smiled big as she walked up to me,
and I poked my finger in her side until she shrieked and hit the
floor.  Most entertaining.  I'm going to call Edith at 5:35AM for her
wake up call.  Later</p>
