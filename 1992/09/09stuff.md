<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>12:50AM Wednesday September 9, 1992.</p>

<p>After school today, Maggie and I drove to Radio Shack and got
breadboards for digital logic class.  I met Laura, Parth, Huy, Tim &
Scott today in bowling.</p>

<p>I chatted with Laura in Chicago today in real time over the VAX.
We plan to do it again at 8PM tomorrow.  I flirted with Maggie some
today, and I told her honestly that if I ever settle down, I hope I
can find a girl as perfect as she.</p>

<p>AJ, a freshman in Fred's Baoculus class asked if I ever leave the
dorms.  I told him, "not if I can help it."</p>
