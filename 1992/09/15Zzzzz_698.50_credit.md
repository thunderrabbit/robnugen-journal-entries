<p>I got my Citibank bill from VISA, and they also credited my account for $698.50 for the Nishika Camera shit.  Dude. so I called them to try and
determine if I can keep it no sweat.  The lady gave me the impression that Visa is now waiting for Nishika to send them the money.  Hmmm.  I'm just
going to hang onto it and not spend anything for a while.  Hopefully I can keep it.</p>
