<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>8:47AM Wednesday 16 September 1992</p>

<p class="dream">Bobbi was in a class with me and she held my hand during class.  Cool.</p>

<p>Oh - last night Molly said that I will kiss her this semester. Double Cool.</p>

<p class="dream">The dream was set in Mr Reagh's class at 12 or 1am (so I could say "Good Morning,") The lights went out and I immediately held her hand.</p>
