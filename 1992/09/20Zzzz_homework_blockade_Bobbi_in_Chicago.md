<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>2:30AM Monday 21 September 1992</p>

<p>"Today" was Homework Blockade.  i slept till 10AM and then went to the VAX until about 4PM and worked on the first LISP assignment.  Then I went to
Molly's room and slept for about an hour until Cindy called looking for Molly.  Molly wasn't there.  (She was at Ninfa's with everyone) Cindy said she
talked to Sarah, who said Bobbi went back to Chicago!  Holy Crap!  So- that sucks.  Cindy doesn't know if it's like permanent of what the heck.  She
said she'll try to find out.</p>

<p>Then Molly got back and we've done Probability &amp; Statitics since then.  She went with me to the laundry mat, and did homework there.  Now we're
here in my bed making out (NOT!) (heh heh) going to sleep 'til 7:30AM, at which point I shall write up my 3 prob &amp; stats turn-in problems.  Later</p>
