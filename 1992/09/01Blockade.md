<p class=date>8:35AM Tuesday 1 September 1992</p>

<p>The most triumphant thing has happened.  Remember how I'm totally
going to get a 4.0?  Remember my Homework Blockades that I've set up?
Molly & Maggie & Marcel & Steve all think it's a good idea and we're
all going to do it.  RIGHT!!!  That is so totally totally cool.  Molly
suggested we set up a Blockade every Sunday and Wednesday, and then
some secondary ones if necessary.  That is so totally excellent.</p>

<p>This is my schedule including HOMEWORK BLOCKADES that Molly will
follow as well.</p>

<p>Yesterday after school I went shopping with Maggie.  I enjoyed
spending some time with her.  We bought a new pencil for me; my 8 year
old pencil that I've had since Mr Bandecca's algebra 9th grade has
died....  I did homework and then we played nuclear war in Marcel's
room.  I goofed around with Judy & Steve at the OB desk until 1AM or
so.  I had trouble staying awake on the way home..  Later</p>
