<p class=date>3:20 in the fucking morning Tuesday Sept 22 1992</p>

<p>Bobbi is gone.  Bobbi is in Chicago.  Bobbi is in fucking <b>Chicago</b>.  I've had a pissy day today and I think that's why.  That and that Maggie
told me to "have a little respect" for Danielle's (Bartley) committment to her husband.  Fuck her who does she think she is?  I know what I'm doing
when I'm flirtiing.  Fuck them all.  I just want a new girl to kiss.  I just want a new girl to kiss.</p>

<p><b>I JUST WANT A NEW GIRL TO KISS.</b></p>

<p>At 11:30PM, I was at the VAX, pissed at my program.  I should have fucking gone home and been asleep for 3 hours now.  Instead, I fucking called
Carrie to see if she would walk around with me.  She did, and we went to the UC (locked) and then to the Agnes Arnold Auditorium.  Then we talked to
Judy for a couple hours.</p>

<p class="anger">I just want a new girl to KISS!</p>
