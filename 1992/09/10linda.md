<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>2:10PM Thursday September 10, 1992</p>

<p>I met Nancy, William, & Trang, in my bowling class.  In our 2
groups (2 groups per sheet of paper & 1 paper per 2 lanes) are Me,
Tim, Scott, Parth, Huy, & Laura in the other lane are Nancy, William,
Jodi, Molly & Trang.  I met Linda & Mike today in FORTRAN.  Linda is
fun.  She slapped my hand when I started picking at the carpet burn on
my foot.  That was funny.  I gave her my internet address, and I got
hers.  If she and I ever remenisce about old times, I'll say she hit
me before I had known her 1 hour.</p>

<p>I got a great mail package from John from Good Morning America.  He
sent an ABC umbrella and a GMA mug and a packet of rattle snake eggs.
Instead of eggs it contains a washer wound up on a rubber band
mechanism and it "buzzes" when the package is opened.  Wonderful.</p>
