<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>Midnight Wednesday/Thursday September 9/10 1992</p>

<p>Today after school I came home and goofed around a lot in spite of
the fact I should have been on HOMEWORK BLOCKADE.  So I called Maggie,
and she said I had to do six problems in statistics and turn them in
to her tomorrow.  She said (at my request) she would give me a
"modest" kiss if I did the homework.  That was enough prompting to make
me do it, so I spent abut 5 minutes going through Hard Times, beating
the hell out of my stats book.  Then I spent a solid 3 hours working,
and I did about 10 or 12 problems.  Total cool.</p>
