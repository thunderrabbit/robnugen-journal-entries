<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>11:50PM, Saturday 12 September 1992</p>

<p>Today I worked with Bruce for 8.5 hours @ $8/hour = $68 dollars off my rent.  Then I went to Heather's and we cruised to BookStop and I bought a
Prob&amp;Stats help book.  Then we got frozen pizza and Ben &amp; Jerry's chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream (RIGHT!!!)</p>

<p>I read section 2.1 of Prob &amp; Stats after we ate pizza and before we ate ice cream.  Cool.  Tomorrow is a Homework Blockade when I wake up.  later.
