<p>"Today" I found out that Bobbi with Braces is part of the Cougar
Patrol.  I'm going to find her and kiss the shit out of her.  I
totally met Inga, who lives across from Molly & Laura.  We went to
House of Pies and I sat beside Kim, Greg's girlfriend.  Kim said she
hates me, though.  Oh well.  Later.</p>
