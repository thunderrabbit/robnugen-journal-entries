<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>1:05am Saturday 19 September 1992</p>

<p>"Today" I went to class and then on the way back to the dorms, I saw Celeste near the wading pool, so I played frisbee with her on the rocks and
such for about 15 minutes until she had to meet Elizabeth.  At the end, she said, "Thank you for playing with me."  Cool.</p>

<p>I played in Molly's room for a while and then we went to lunch.  After lunch, I did the big jump from OB ledge to ground over the stairs.  My
sandals locked onto the ground, but my right foot slid forward and out of the sandal and I gouged a flap of skin off my big toe.  We cleaned that up,
and then went to pick up Debbie Forester to go to the movies.  Her roommate, Annabeth was in there and she did the funniest thing.  See, she's prim
and proper (and quite pretty)  She reminds me of Lani as far as looks go.  I noted that she sat down specifically on her bed in a weird way.  As if
trying to hide something.  when she leaned forward a bit, I noted it was her bra or panties or something.  I hit the floor laughing.  I told her, "You
crack me up."  "why?" she asked.  I moved closer to her ear so that the whole world wouldn't hear, (I couldn't care less if everyone heard, but I
didn't want to unneccessarily embarass her) "You picked an interesting location to sit."  She kinda smiled an embarassing-moment-but-oh-well smile and
moved them off her bed.  Then she went to hop in the shower and told me, "You can sit on my bed." So I sat on it and began to bounce a little on it
like a little kid.  She said something like, "Don't wear out my springs," so I asked, "Why do you need them?" just to see her reaction.  She didn't
answer, and Molly &amp; Debbie told me to be nice.  Heh heh.</p>

<p>I'm going to make her loosen up a bit.  After she went with us to Marble Slab last night, she told Molly today, "I really had fun last night."
Cool.  She needs to get out more often.  We went to Coogs Cafe, and Kim bought me supper.  I told Debbie that she should try to baby-sit me.  "I will
just look at you and smile when you tell me to do something, and then I'll run."  She said she would eventually catch me and "spank (my) bottom."</p>

<p>We went to Greenspoint Mall and Kim, Judy &smp; I played frisbee while the others shopped for 20 minutes before our movie started.  Kim &samp; I
did a few flirtations throughout the day, mostly via eye contact.  We watch House Sitter, which I didn't exactly like the ending.  (What about Becky?)
Then Marcel and I played frisbee in an all checkerboard tile walls &smp; concrete ceiling &amp; floor hallway.  We did some cool out bounce shots.  I
love playing frisbee all the time.</p>

<p>Carrie spanked my ass as I leaped past her (she sat on OB wall) from tall OB wall to the short perpindicular OB wall.  She said, "I've always
wanted to spank a perfectly rounded ass."</p>

<p>Now it's 1:35AM 19 Sept 1992.  I'm in Tomball about to go to bed.  "Tomorrow" is HOMEWORK BLOCKADE.  Later.</p>
