<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>11:50PM Monday September 7, 1992, Labor Day.</p>

<p>Last night I drove out to Tomball to say HI to dad and check out
his new 486DX 33MHz SVGA computer.  Very cool.  We hooked up my tape
backup and gave him a bunch of stuff including my Xrated gifs and
such.  We looked at those briefly, claiming non-interest.</p>

<p>We also played frisbee in the rain.  Very fun.  The rain was
pleasant and the air was warm.  Fred and I tossed the ol' friz around
for about half an hour.  Now I'm home and I just did a down/upload
session on the Castle of Dreams and I played Blockout and practiced on
a typing tutor that dad gave me.  Dad's going to try to get my 140 meg
hard drive fixed.  I would totally love that.  Later</p>
