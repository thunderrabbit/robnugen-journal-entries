<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>Fucking 2:45AM, Tuesday 15 September 1992</p>

<p>I have to be in class in 7.25 hours.</p>

<p>"Today," Molly, Maggie, Jeanine, and I went to House of Pies and it was totally not busy.  Our waitress, Tina was cool.  She brought me a big glass
of water and learned our names and changed the radio to a cooler station.  We left her a big tip.  Brandon, the RA from second floor Taub, and AJ, and
another dude came in and sat in the adjacent booth.</p>

<p>As we were leaving, we talked for 10 minutes to Angela &amp; Tina, the two waitresses.  Angela is totally pretty.  I love her hair.</p>

<p>Molly said that she did the "Love Scale Test" machine and it said she needed to take a cold shower.  Angela sad, "I never need to take a cold
shower."  And then she said directly to me, "but if I do I'll tell you."  Cool.</p>

<p>I wonder if anything could come of this.</p>

<p>Bobbi update:  She is apparently living with Sarah, a Cougar Place desk attendant.  I looked for Sarah in the phone directory, but didn't find
her.  "Tomorrow" I'll try to locate her the way I saw her on the second day of school.  If that doesn't work, i'll try to wait for her at the UHPD
after or before her Cougar Patrol Shift.  (8PM - 12AM Sat &amp; Sun)</p>
