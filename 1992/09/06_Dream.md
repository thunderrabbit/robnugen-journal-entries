<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>9:45AM Sunday Sept 6 1992</p>

<p>I just had a dream</p>

<p class=dream>I was being rolled backwards lying down through a
building at school by my school friends.  At one point, I saw a woman
named Lauren from Northwoods church, and she had braces.  I told them,
"stop." so they did and I got up and talked to her some and hugged her
and gave her a bite on her neck.  I kissed her a tiny bit on the lips
and I felt her braces with my tongue.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I whispered, "come here" to her ear.  She came
closer and I said, "I've got a braces fetish"  so she kissed me again
and I licked her braces and nibbled on them and loved it.  I was
totally getting a hardon in my dream(?) and was about to orgasm, so I
quit kissing her so I wouldn't cum everywhere in my dream.  I was like
entirely turned on in the dream.  We stopped kissing and I calmed down
a little.  It turned out that she lived in New York or somewhere far
away, was married, and pregnant.  So we exchanged addresses and such.
Then she drew a cool 3-D rendition of my apartment, except it wasn't
my apartment.</p>

<p>Really weird.  I'm going to look up Bobbie in the old UH phone book
- see what I can get.  Later</p>

<p>785-3542 It was a ans. machine with a dude's voice.  crap.</p>
