<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>1:29 AM Thursday, 3 Sept 1992</p>

<p>"Today" I spent all afternoon on my homework blockade.  Oh -
Danielle was in Digital Logic.  She is married and happy about it.
She also has her braces removed now.  Her smile looks great.  I talked
to her for 30 minutes after class today, and we joked around about
kissing, etc.  I'm very glad to see her again.</p>

<p>Update on Bobbie with braces.  Max, the 3rd floor RA, told me her
last name.  So I went to see Judy, a friend of the clique, at the OB
desk.  She looked her up, but she wasn't in the directory.  so Judy
gave me the extension of Theresa, who knows Bobbie, and probably has
her number.  Cool.  Probability & Statistics sucks.  The book sucks.
I like Digital Logic.  Later</p>
