<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>1:50AM, Wednesday 16 September 1992</p>

<p>I didn't find her today.  I played with my VAX accounts for 4 hours.  My ST1M5 is my mail account and my COSC18IC is for work - boh LISP and
Fortran.  My fortran account is unused.</p>

<p>I also chatted with Laura via internet.</p>

<p>Molly and I went to House of Pies.</p>
