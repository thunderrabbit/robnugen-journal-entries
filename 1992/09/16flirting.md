<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>11:40PM (Before Midnight!) Wednesday 16 September 1992</p>

<p>Today was a Homework Blockade and I got a bunch done on each of my classes.  Cool.  After my Blockade, Maggie and I talked and flirted a lot.  I
always enjoy alone time with her.  She told me that she has tied up John and eaten apricot preserves off his chest and off "the hardest part of his
body."  We hugged and touched and talked about flirting.  We talked about my burning desire to kiss Bobbi, and Maggie said she told Bobbi I was
looking for her.  Bobbi simply said "OK," since she was apparently in a hurry.  Cool.  I'm totally going to kiss the shit out of her.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'm going to get my 104 Card from 104KRBE.  It will allow me to get Blood Sugar Sex Magic at Soundwaves for $8.99.  Cool.  I'll also
register for the Moonlight Bicycle Ramble, a bike ride for 5000 people at 2am, October 15th or so.  Total Cool.  I'm also going to try to get a copy
of Molly's key.</p>

<p>First I'm going to meet Linda from Fortran at 9:30AM &amp; introduce her to the VAX and such.  I'll also flirt with her and fun stuff like that.
That is all.</p>
