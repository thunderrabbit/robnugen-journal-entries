<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>2AM Sunday Sept 6.</p>

<p>2 days ago, Friday night while we were in the checkout line at
Randall's, I did the most incredible thing.  Marcel had 3 bananas and
was trying to guesstimate their weight.  He said, "these are about a
pound."  I picked them up, "no. they are a full one and one half
pounds.  In fact, they are one point six two pounds."  Then the dude
put them on the scale.  1.62 pounds.  "Oh my God!" We gave each other
five really hard.  It was totally incredible.  I kept the receipt.
It's in my scrapbook.</p>

<p>"Today" I slept fully until noon.  I listened to the radio about
Lalapaloza 92, a mini woodstock out 59 south.  I tried in vain to do
some prob & stats, but it sucks like crazy, so I went to the dorms and
Molly helped me.</p>

<p>I played hard at disk gun warrior with AJ, Steven, Brian and some
other dude on second floor.  We each have disk guns and we run
everywhere in the dorms shooting each other.  At one point, I tackled
Steve at full top speed and we both almost died smashing against the
wall.  His semiautomatic dart gun got fucked up, and we spent several
hours trying to fix it.  We just about got it fixed but not perfect.
