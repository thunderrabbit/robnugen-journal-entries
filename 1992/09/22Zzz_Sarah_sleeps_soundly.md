<p class=date>3:30AM Wednesday 23 Sept 1992</p>

<p>Today after bowling, I played frisbee with Laura from bowling.</p>

<p>Today I walked around the dorms and ended up in Sarah &amp; Missy's room on first floor.  I talked to them for about an hour and then a dude named
Tom did something really dumb that pissed off Sarah.  So I sat with her for 30 minutes while she described what a crappy thing he had done.  She cried
and I held her until she fell asleep.  Sarah sleeps soundly.  After about 30 minutes of her sleeping, I tried to wake her up.  I did everything.
Talked to her, shook her, tickled her, pulled her eyelids open - everything.  During all of this, I was pretty horny (of course) so I kissed her on
the lips twice.  I didn't tongue her, but I thought about it.  Finally, I woke her up by standing her up and just hugging &amp; rocking (rotate
actually) her back and forth.  She finally finally wake up after a long time.  Wild.  At the very end, when she was awake and just barely coherent, I
asked, "should I bite you on the neck?" And I bit her on the neck and she giggled.  After she woke, she invited me to Two Pesos with all her friends,
but I declined so that I could do homework with Maggie.  So I did digital logic with her until 2am and I got home at 2:30 &amp; took a shower.</p>
