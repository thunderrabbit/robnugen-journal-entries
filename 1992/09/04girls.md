<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>Friday 4 Sept 1992 12:25AM</p>

<p>"Today" I was bored in Fortran, and then went to bowling.  We
watched a dumb movie about the history of bowling.  It was cool,
though, since Maggie leaned back on my knees.  We had no digital logic
lab, so she and I went to her room and talked.  We ate pop tarts and
then I got her to lie on me face to face on her bed as we talked.  We
didn't do anything, but I did my normal pleading & requesting just a
little kiss from her.  We joke like that a lot.  I loved it.  Anyway,
we were laying on her bed with her on me and Danielle came in.  Maggie
kinda climbed off me and I thought it was hilarious.  Maggie said she
would have preferred it to be John, since she could "explain it off
him," and he would forget about it.  Danielle <em>won't</em> forget
about it, and will apparently ask Maggie about it later.</p>

<p>After artificial intelligence, I watched the Simpsons with Laura.
Then I went home, but talked to Nina, the UHPD cop, along the way.</p>

<p>Lucy Proctor came over tonight and we typed in her resume' and
printed it on the laser printer at Social Work.  I enjoyed doing that.
We kissed at the very end of the night, but nothing else.</p>

<p>I called Theresa-who-knows-Bobbie, but it was a wrong number.  I
also met an RA, Jennifer, who has some of Bobbie's stuff and will give
Bobbie a note that I wrote, indicating my 24 hour hotline phone
number.  I may also search for her tomorrow morning.  Wish me luck.
Later</p>
