<p>Holy Shit!</p>

<p>AAA!</p>

<p>Ok</p>

<p>The Bobbi number on the previous page was wrong!</p>

<p>Hh hh hh hh</p>

<p>OK OKOK</p>

<p>I had been calling 743-7299 and leaving messages.  I called just now and they said it was the wrong number.  Crud.  So I called the Cougar Place
desk and Yay! I had been calling the wrong number.  So I called the right one and woke up Sarah (?) and left my number with her.  So - I have left my
number with someone who sees Bobbi often.  Cool.</p>

<p>Arg- I just called UHPD, and Bobbi is not working Cougar Patrol tonight.  Crap.</p>

<p>Hh hh hhhh</p>

<p>I'm going crazy!!!! OK.</p>

<p>I'm going to the dorms now.  Later.</p>
