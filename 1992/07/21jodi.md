<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=message>"I've had to bite my tongue several times just to
keep from saying 'I Love You.'  It just seems so natural.  You're so
good to me."

<p class=date>(couple days later) (Tuesday 21 July 92)

<p>That's what Laura said (in red) to me about 2 nights ago after we
went out to Chili's.  Man oh man..

<p>Last night Jodi came over and got her stero.  I went over to her
house to help her move it.  Then we hopped into her (apartment)
jaccuzzi and started to make out and we ended up fucking there in the
hot tub.  Wild.  It was such a cool (hot) feeling to have warmth all
around and to be almost floating there while fucking.  The bubbles
felt great too.  After I came, we were still naked and kinda rubbing
on eachother when 2 dudes came into the pool area (it was 2am) and
laughed a little and pointed when they saw what we were doing...

<p>We got dressed and got out and then we fucked in the shower and
again on her futon.  Then we slept from about 2:45 or 3AM to 8AM

<p>I came home and got my Nishika Camera Company shit mailed back so
that VISA can file a grievance against them and I can hopefully get my
money back.  (See May 20th) (See August 4th)

<p>Pierre and I just now went looking for a hand gun and sandals,
respectively at Oshman's, Carter Country and Academy.  I didn't find
shit except for Tiddies brand sandals at Academy, but I didn't get
them.

<p>Now I'm going to UH to get my LISP account straightened out.  Later
