<p>My new memory management is to run a Windows environment in my
head.  First I think of my main window:

<p>Inside school, I have so far Calculus, Computer Science, and
Physics.  Inside work I pt some produce codes for Kroger.  I also put
a doctor's signature.  In self, I made a self help section and stopped
my ear from ringing today.  I also want to put a clock in a window.
The star in my lower left corner puts me to sleep just like sleep mode
(screen saver) in Windows.  I just pop up my window, move my eyes to
that corner and it makes me fall asleep instantly.  I also have a
temporary memory window.  In that one I store info that I don't want
to keep forever.  Under address and phone number, I have a window for
each letter of the alphabet and then I have names under each of those
and then phone numbers and birthdates in there.  Cool.  I'm going to
use my window for a long time to come.
