<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>Tuesday July 28 Late (It's probably Wed. by now)

<p>We watched Olympics at Laura's.  I totally loved it and started
doing pushups and situps and shit.  Those were healthy chicks on
there.  I watched womens' diving and mens' gymnastics.  Cool.  On the
way home, I was falling asleep, so I stopped the van on the side of
the highway, wend out into the highway and did 15 pushups in the
middle of the lane.  cool.  Then I was more awake and I went on my
way.

<p>Today I got a bunch of day planner shit done.  Very cool.  Then I
went in for my first day in the main pharmacy.  It sucked.  I spent 2
hours with John M delivering IV's and I was thinking No Way.  I will
totally hate this shit.  forget it.  forget it.  So I told Sister
Gemma.  Forget it.  So when Aug 31 rolls around I'll be jobless unless
I find one before then.  I'm going to call Olsten temp agency
tomorrow.

<p>After I got home, I cleaned my room some and Lucy called.  I went
over and we <! fucked eachother's brains out.  Wonderful.  We did it
in her bed, the shower, her bed again and the living room floor.  In
order to get me hard, she finger fucked my ass (on the bed) that was a
new experience for me... I came 3 times total and when I got home, my
dick hurt. >
