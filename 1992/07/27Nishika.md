<h1>RIGHT!!!</h1>

<p>I called Nishika and cancelled all their shit and I got a return
authorization number (205425) so I should be able to get my money
back. Whew.  I called VISA and they said that since I got a return
authorization number, that it will probably work out OK and all will
be hunky dorey.  I'm very pleased to hear that.  Sigh.  I've been
lucky this summer.  I got $3000 from dad, $1500 from Monner and I've
gotten my insurance to pay for my titty surgery and I've practically
gotten my money back from Nishika.  RIGHT!!!  I'm going to take a
shower and go to Laura's.  Later
