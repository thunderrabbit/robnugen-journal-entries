<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>1am Saturday July 18, 1992

<p>On Wednesday I spent the night with Laura.  I got entirely caught
up on Bluewave stuff.  A dude named Homer the Brave and I beat up on
Scout Seven.  Thursday I went to Fred's work and he and Caleb showed
me the Next machines.  Very cool.  Then Fred and I played frisbee all
over campus.  Then we went inside Agnes Arnold auditorium and played
frisbee in there.  We went behind where the stage is and I found a
steel ladder going up into the ceiling.  So I climbed it.  Fred
followed and we ended up in a small "room" where the air conditioner
sat.  There was another ladder so I climbed it and poked my head and
hands out onto the roof.  I didn't get entirely on the roof because I
could be seen too easily.  Then we went down and to the Cullen water
fountain that's being rebuilt.  They've got 1/2 - 3/4 of the concrete
poured.  I walked out onto the concrete where I signed the water pipe.
Each nozzle had a handle on it, so I turned one and sure enough
(squirt) it had water pressure.  So I turned it a lot for just a
second SPRAY!!! I don't know how high it went because I was watching
the handle.  But some sprayed on me.  Fred saw it.  Very cool.  I want
to go out there and swipe one of the handles.  That would be fun.
