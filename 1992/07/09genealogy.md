<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>July 9 1992 Thursday 1:05AM

<p>2 days ago, Laura and I went to the Clayton Genealogical Library.
Very very very cool.  We looked up stuff.  I looked up my Great Great
Grandparent's on Dad's side.  I looked through the 1900 Census
records.  I found a female named Texas Foley.  I want to research her
further.  I also found Franklin Hess, who at one point lived with his
son in law and daughter and wife and 5 grand kids.  One of the
grandkids was my great grand father.  Word.  I'm going back tomorrow
to look up Texas Foley, Franklin Hess, Stuff on Ma's side and a guy in
Missouri named Carmack for Jeanine, who called me tonight.  Later
