<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>9:25 AM Sunday 26 July 1992

<p>Heather had forgotten about her girls' night out last night, so she
and I didn't get to JAM.  However, I finished reading chapter 5 in
Wishcraft this morning.  Barbara (Author of Wishcraft) suggested that
I start an Actions and feelings jouranl.  She writes, "At the top of
each page, write the following:

<p><pre>    DATE                WHAT I DID         HOW I FELT"</pre>

<p>Starting today I'll make a note of what I did no matter how trivial
it seems.  Everything I do is a step toward my goal.  So, I begin with
the following Action.

<p><pre>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

    D        +----   WID  ----+      HIF
26 July 92   |   I made the   | Pretty darn brilliant
-------------+   following    +-------------------------
notation: "@@@@@@@@" across the whole page means "begin 
Actions & Feelings Journal"  "#######" across the whole 
page means "end Actions and Feelings Journal"  D is for 
"date" WID="what I Did"  HIF = "How I Felt"  Very cool.

The lines such as these ------- around D & HIF separate the
columns.  I may not need those if my accomplishments can
be described in fewer words..  But knowing me, I won't
describe anything tritely.

Let's backtrack

    D        |             WID                     |      HIF
25 July 92   | Gave my 2 week notice at Kroger     |  Sorrow / relief

                                                   |  But how can you

<p>Does this touch stone pass the magic wand test?  Ok ** POOF ** I am
now dead for 1000 years and they still are talking about me.  Totaly
cool.  But what did I do for me?  Who else are they talking about?
What do I really really want?  Heck, I don't know.

<p class=date>10:20AM

<p>Why am I going to school?  Why do I say, "Hey I'm not worried about
graduating.  I like going to school."  ?? What's going on here?  Am I
putting off life forever?  Barbara wonders if I really need school to
start having what I want.

<h1>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h1>

what the HELL I want to do If I don't know What the HELL I Want!
Fucking Shit is useless There's no way.  I'M Going to have to go back
through the whole DAMN Wishcraft book just to fucking start over and
figure out what my fucking touchstone is and I don't have time and I'm
Never going to be able to do it and this SUCKS!  AAAGGH Fuck The WORLD
