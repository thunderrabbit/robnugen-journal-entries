This thank you is from last week or so, but I just now put the images
on my image site.  [Dad's Pies](http://dadspies.co.nz/) are awesome!

    The strong, silent type of pie that will give you advice,
    fix your car, give you shoulder rides, take you to sports
    games and teach you to ride a bike. They are the wholesome,
    dependable pies that people love to eat, since 1981.
