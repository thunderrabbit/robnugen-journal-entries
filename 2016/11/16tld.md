Wow.

    We are happy to announce that Amazon QuickSight is now generally
    available in US East (Northern Virginia), US West (Oregon) and
    Europe (Ireland) regions! More details at https://quicksight.aws.

Check out that TLD!  https://quicksight.aws

Yes, it's still cool.  Did Amazon create that for themselves?  I know
Google did a few, but hadn't seen any other companies with top level
domains.
