How am I the last one to know this?

We have about seven apps using parse as the backend.

Today I migrated some of our parse data to mlab.com and was able to
[set up an elastic beanstalk thing which should hopefully run Parse Server](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/how-to-set-up-parse-server-on-aws-using-aws-elastic-beanstalk/).
Still need to sort it out a bit more.
