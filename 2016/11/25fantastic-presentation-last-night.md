Yay! Last night went better than I expected; pretty much near perfect
as possible given my short prep time.

These are some notes I wrote on the way home last night.

    Felt really nervous the days before
    
    Really dumb I hadn't practiced for nine months
    
    Leave me alone!!
    
    Stop changing it!!!
    
    Practice practice practice practice made it perfect
    
    Once we had the skeleton of the arc, filling in the muscles made it great
    
    During the Japanese presentations I practiced mine in my head..
    
    After it finished holy shit it was perfect!!
    
    Wait am I still nervous?  I did it, right?  It went so smoothly it was like a dream
    
    I did it though, right?  Yeah I just finished.  Wow I finished!!!
    
    Holy shit it's finished and it was perfect!!!!!  Thank you Soness!!!!!!
    
    Thank you Drian!!!!!
