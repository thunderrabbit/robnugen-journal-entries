I was told that Western Union could send money directly to my bank
account. It's a new service they offer.

Except when I tried to send money to my bank account in the US, I was
told I'd have to go to the US to get it.

Ahem.

I bitched at them and they changed the recipient, but still, smells
like false advertising or crappy internal communication ("we don't
have that service, sir") or something.

Ma was able to collect the money and put it in my account.  Thanks, Ma!
