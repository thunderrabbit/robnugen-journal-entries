This past weekend I learned that Amazon Photos offers unlimited
storage for photos.  It's free with Amazon Prime.

Lin has Amazon Prime, so I had her account give my account Amazon
Prime as well (through their family sharing thing).

But her account is on amazon.co.jp while mine is on amazon.com so I
had to create a new account on amazon.co.jp.  But now it seems I have
Amazon Photos on both my accounts!  Or maybe I'm confused, but we'll
see.

I'm writing this now as I reboot my machine; running Amazon Drive
overnight to upload a ton of data tied up my CPU.  I was able to
recover without kill -9 any processes, and the CPU seems fine now, but
I'm just rebooting because I haven't in a while.
