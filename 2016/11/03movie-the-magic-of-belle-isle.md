Lin and I watched
[The Magic of Belle Isle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_of_Belle_Isle)
on Netflix tonight; it was lovely and touching.  I didn't like the
grouchy characters at first, but the character arcs were beautiful.
Yes, it's a simple story on the surface, but it's got stories within
stories and layers upon layers.
