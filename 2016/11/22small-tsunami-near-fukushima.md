We had a small earthquake at 6am.  According to
[JMA quake website](http://www.jma.go.jp/en/quake/) it was near
Fukushima.  My students this morning said there was a tsunami 1 meter
tall.

Trains around Tokyo were snarled for a bit, but I arrived on time
because I usually pad my commute for such problems.

This morning's lesson was in Akabanebashi, a lesson I usually teach on
Mondays.  Now I'm in Akihabara eating breakfast across Beck's Coffee
Shop, and AKB48 Cafe and Shop, one of which is not yet open for the
day.
