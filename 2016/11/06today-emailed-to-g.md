Today I worked out in the park with a group who call themselves Suns
Out Guns Out https://www.facebook.com/groups/sogotko and I can see my
endurance and strength have increased since I joined them a couple
months ago.

I found out a few days ago that my 7 minute presentation is ON for
November 24th;
https://www.pechakucha.org/cities/tokyo/events/581bfccc9831a6196b000002
I'm putting it together and pulling myself together to make it the best I can.

It's quite interesting; 24 November I'll be on stage for PechaKucha,
soon thereafter I'll be on stage for Head Heart and Soul.  Mid
December I'll be on camera for a Japanese TV show featuring foreigners
in Japan.
