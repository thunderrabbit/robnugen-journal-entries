"Today" I spent about 5 hours working on a rewrite of some code that
worked back when there were 40k records, but isn't quite as good with
90k records.  Not a huge difference, but I'm hoping to make the number
of records not matter any more.

Also sorted out the details for a new shirt coming soon to a TV near
anyone who watches a lot of TV in Japan.

Also found out that my Magination magnets should arrive in about a
week or so

Also watched Midnight in Paris (nice movie), and two episodes of Rick
and Morty on Netflix.

Also meditated for an hour, and mighttttt do it again tomorrow, but I
think I've stayed up too late to do it and feel okay with how much
work I'll get done.

Also watched a couple videos of Dr Greer speaking; it was actually his
videos that prompted me to meditate.
