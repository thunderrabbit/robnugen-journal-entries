My group lesson had only one student; I suggested https://newsinlevels.com and
https://breakingnewsenglish.com as ways she can practice extensive reading.
There are probably some free sites that are actually geared toward ER,
but I don't have their domains memorized.

Surprise! That turned out to be my last lesson there.  I had mentioned
to them that it's a bit far for me to travel and then boom they got a
new teacher.
