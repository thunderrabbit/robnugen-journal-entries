I took my Suica card out of my wallet this morning and wore it
*inside* my glove while it was raining.  I held my umbrella and took
the bus to the station with Lin where she took a picture of me
barefoot in the rain.  Gave her a kiss then walked home and when I
went back to the station for work, I noticed my Suica was missing.

Oh that's right I must have taken it out of my glove and not put it
back in my wallet.

Well, now I'm home and did a cursory search in all the places where it
should be, and I don't see it.

Good thing it's not possible to load them up with more than $200.

Dang.

Found it on Jennie's cat tower.  I'll have to have a talk with her.
