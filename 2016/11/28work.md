Worked today with S at s and finally figured out Google Doubleclick
For Providers or whatever it's called.  Basically there's inventory
and orders.  Inventory has ad units and ad placements (multiple ad
units).  Orders have line items which have creatives.  Orders can have
multiple line items.  Creatives are many-to-many with Line items.
Creatives are basically banners or videos the end users will see as
ads.
