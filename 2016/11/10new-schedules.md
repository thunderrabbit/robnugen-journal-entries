Because Lin and I moved to Shin Yurigaoka, my commute to Fukuura cost
more than I was paid for travel, so I mentioned that to them and then
boom new Wednesday schedule starting yesterday.  Two classes were new
students for me; kids classes, so it will be a good chance to get some
experience with kids classes.  Next week there will be 3 other classes
as well; with adults, I guess.

Because of the daylight saving time change in the US, my Thursday
schedule has a new hour gap before online men's group.  Right now I'm
chilling in what I call the Zavas building, overlooking the water
fountain, which is being cleaned today.  In a few minutes, I'll head
over to Lazona for early lunch before I-group meeting.

Because it's been a while, I contacted Kai to see if she'd like to
have lunch.  It took a month to get on her schedule, but we're going
to California Pizza Kitchen today.  Yay CPK!
