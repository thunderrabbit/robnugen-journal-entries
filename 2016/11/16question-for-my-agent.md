Dear agent, when you are able to understand this question, can you let
me know why Marcellus Wallace said "you leave town tonight, right now"
to Butch in Pulp Fiction?

Why "tonight, right now"?  Was that in the script?  Was it improvised?

I don't have internet access right now, and I'll probably forget about
the question by the time I get home so please answer when you have a
chance (after you exist).

Also, it might be entertaining to remind me that at the time I wrote
this, I had no idea what I might call you.  Will I give you a name
like a person or animal?  Interesting to imagine a future that's
coming quickly or never at all.
