I upgrade hugo by doing

    brew update
    brew upgrade hugo

Hugo 0.16 compiled my journal like this:

    5834 pages created
    55 non-page files copied
    2094 paginator pages created
    821 tags created
    8 categories created
    in 7390 ms

Hugo 0.17 compiled my journal like this:

    5835 pages created
    55 non-page files copied
    2095 paginator pages created
    822 tags created
    8 categories created
    total in 6502 ms

But deploy via rsync is still slow as heck, I guess because all the
files are recreated..  I'm gonna try to run hugo on my Dreamhost server.

(maybe)

Couldn't figure it out.  Will try later.
