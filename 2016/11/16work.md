I worked three jobs today..  not full time shifts, but I worked for 3
distinct companies.  First in Akabanebashi I taught the early lesson I
usually teach on Mondays, but they moved it to today for some reason.

Then I went to my programming job in Ebisu where I did a tiny bit of (unpaid)
work while mostly preparing for PechaKucha.

Then headed to JB where I taught for five hours.  This is quite new
for me; I was teaching 1 hour on Wednesdays for them, so this is a
welcome change.  It's not 5 times the pay, but it's definitely more,
and definitely closer to home.
