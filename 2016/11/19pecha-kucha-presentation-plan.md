I plan to speak at [PechaKucha on 24 November](http://pechakucha.org/cities/tokyo/events/581bfccc9831a6196b000002)!

    These are the pictures I've submitted, and sorta-kinda what I plan to
    say for each picture.  Thanks to Soness for helpng me make a coherent
    story that people will hopefully be able to apply to their own lives!

|HI!  I'm Rob!  I like to walk around barefoot.  Here's a picture of me walking to a store in Texas.|It all started back in the halcyon days of university, when we had nothing better to do than watch paint dry.|Though I didn't wear shoes, I carried a frisbee; ready to play at any moment.|I stayed true to my barefoot self and ended up on TV here in Japan!|

|I wasn't always barefoot.  When I first started, I felt two things very keenly: first was fear! I was worried someone wouldn't let me be myself!|The other thing I felt keenly was my feet!  Walking on rough surfaces like this can be quite painful!|But the connection to earth was worth the trouble, so I kept going. Khalil Gibran said Nature delights in feeling our bare feet.|Speaking of connections, here's a heart, soul, and sole connection!  Both times my wife and I celebrated our marriage, I was barefoot!|

|Marriage like barefooting, sometime has surprises! One time I thought my wife was upset. But I asked her, and what-do-you-know; she said "I'm just fine!"|So we were hiking along in life, marriage, and hiking trails, and just as I hoped, everything was fine! (there's blood in the next picture so watch out)|Oh no!  And then surprise!  It wasn't fine. Completely unexpectedly pain occurs|What happened?  It looks like someone wasn't paying attention to where he was going (or maybe to what he was saying)! And then someone else got hurt.|

|So how do we usually deal with this hurt? Hide in a corner?  Perhaps behind a pile of paper at work? Perhaps by not saying anything at all?|What about just feel the feelings and play anyway?  Run outside and feel the grass between your toes! Live life and feel the emotions in your heart|In fact, go out on a limb and share your heart!  Make some art! Make it uniquely yours and allow your soul to shine!|Okay story time. I was at the station one day and the announcer was like, 'be careful; watch your step'.  I thought he was talking about me!  I looked down and everything seemed okay.|

|Then I looked up and thought!  Ohhh maybe he was encouraging all of us to notice the world around us.|By being barefoot, I have to notice the world around me, sometimes I see things that really.. well that really piss me off!I want to scream and yell but society doesn't like that.|We are told not to feel our emotions.  So I wanted to have a safe place to express my emotions if necessary.|Wouldn't it be great if we could share our feelings honestly?  That's my challenge for you: Notice, Feel, and Express yourself.  If you'd like to scream, I'm here for you.|
