There's scaffolding all around the building where I taught five
lessons this evening.  After they were finished, I climbed on the
scaffolding a little bit.  I could have climbed up quite high, but
chose not to for reasons of propriety.  It was my first time to climb
on scaffolding like this in Japan.  Usually they close it off quite
carefully.. but not in this case.  (^_^)V

The students in the fourth lesson all cancelled so I did a language
exchange with Tomomi.
