I will be presenting at Pecha Kucha on 24 November.

I hate the idea of presenting; part of me wants to cancel everything,
but I hope to see some of you on Thursday November 24th at SuperDeluxe
in Roppongi.

In other news, I'm planning to present Head Heart and Soul to anyone
who wants a sense of what the men's group work is about.

In other news, I'm scheduled to be filmed in mid December for TV show
to air in late December.

I gotta prep and part of me fears I'll sabotage it all.
