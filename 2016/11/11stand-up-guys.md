Watching Stand Up Guys now based on it being a comedy and having
Christopher Walken in it.  Al Pacino is a bonus; I don't know the
third guy.  They're driving some gangsters' car now, being chased by
the police.

Good movie!  Not Pulp Fiction, but still funny, though a little bit
blah ending.  I wanted happily ever after.
