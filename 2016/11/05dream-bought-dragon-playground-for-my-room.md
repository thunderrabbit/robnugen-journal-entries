My dragon arrived, and it was much larger than expcected! I helped the
UPS driver deliver it. There were a few light things but then some
pieces we had to carry together.  First was a large mirror, though it
was covered in fabric.  The tires were like truck tires which I
suggested a game to roll up the driveway together.  She agreed after
realizing I would help carry things, and wasn't just fooling around.

The dragon playground had a working toilet, but I hadn't planned to
install plumbing because I didn't know about it.  The driver thought
it would be good if someone with kids had bought the dragon, but I
told her we don't have kids; the dragon was for me.
