Security theater required me to discard new, sealed, branded, small
plastic drink containers because they were "more than 2.5 ounces."  I
chugged them, spilling a bit of the second one on the floor in my
petty, foolish, wasted, little act of defiance against Chertov and the
warmongering punks who sell the idea that 9/11 was perpetrated by
people living in a cave.

I still got a bomb, three hatchets, sarin gas containers, a katana, a
cactus, and a 44 Magnum through the security gate.

Let's make some https://wtc7.org stickers to paste all over the airport.
