As I was using spacebar to quicklook some images, Finder suddenly quit
showing images, quit responding to any clicks, and wouldn't
acknowledge even that its window was selected.

Yeah, um, Finder is like the most basic user app in OS X; it's the
only one that cannot be turned off.  Ya might want to make sure it works.
