Great surprise to get an email from kT who was like, "I'm on my way!!"
and I finally got her message when she was 15 minutes from Ma's
apartment!  Whoohooo!!!

I skated down to the front office to meet her and big hugs before
walking back to the crib.

HI Lin!  Surprise this is kT! and hugs and chat chat as we waited for
Ma and Jon before heading out to steak dinner at McCormick and
Schmicks, where we were all graciously hosted by Ma's friend Susan.

Super cool that kT and Susan have (had) jobs in similar sectors so
they chatted in secret code about that for a while.

Susan has written a book called [Bench-Pressed](http://smile.amazon.com/Bench-Pressed-Recounts-Blessings-Lessons-Immigration/dp/1475975422/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8), which she felt
compelled to write after serving as a judge within the immigration
system in the US.

kT is headed to Marie's house tonight and will hopefully meet us in
the morning when Jackie and Paul come take us for breaky!
