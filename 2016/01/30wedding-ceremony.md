We drove up to
[Mt Bonnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Bonnell) for marriage
ceremony delivered by Ma and witnessed by Jon, kT, and Alicia.  Fred
couldn't join due to migraine.

Up the steps from the parking lot, I walked barefoot, and asked Lin to
take picutres of me for the TV thing.

There were so many people near the top that we couldn't get a very
good view, so we headed down the hill a bit and found a stone on which
we stood for the ceremony.  Ma put on a colorful stole and did a quick
freestyle service, addressing friends and family for our happy
occassion.  We hadn't specifically prepared vows, but Ma asked if we
would hold hands and offer Promises(*) to each other.

I promised to be supportive and a good listener and a couple other
things.  Lin did likewise, and we got cheers from some supportive
onlookers after we kissed!

Super thanks to them, though we didn't take time to meet them as we
had to get back to top then back down for dinner with Susan.

At the top I chose not to climb onto the "roof" of the overlook
because there were too many kids around.  After Lin and I walked down
to the city side of the view, we came back up and there were kids on
the roof!

(*) Promises were an idea which came from Karina's wedding, which came
from Karina's friend's wedding.
