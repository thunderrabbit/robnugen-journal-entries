<p class="dream">In my men's group, we were asked to organize some
images based on how important they were to us, and it was supposed to
give some insights on our character.  When it was my turn to do it,
only a few of the cards have images.  I kept looking at them and
trying to figure out what was wrong.  The people asked me and I said
"this is a dream so the cards have changed" but I didn't wake up or
otherwise become lucid.</p>
