    Ma!
    
    We found a nice house in 新百合ケ丘 which is close enough to Tokyo
    to work, and safe from tsunamis next time they come.
    
    The house is near the bottom of a hill, but it's still high enough
    to be safe hahaha.  It has a cute sunroom for Mama and double
    windows for insulation everywhere else!
    
    Super excited!
