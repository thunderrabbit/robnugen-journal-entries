I woke up early (compared to when I went to sleep) because I had some
ideas for doing automated testing.  I guess there's no harm in adding
some CSS classes to make finding things easier.  I may even add a
click all that are unselected option if I can't figure out how to do
it with CasperJS.

But first I gotta repair a script which runs every 5 minutes via cron.
It doesn't run on my local machine, so I missed it after updating the
DB.
