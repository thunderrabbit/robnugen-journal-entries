I'm up to video 13 in this series
https://codereviewvideos.com/course/ansible-tutorial by Chris.  I've
started a repo on bitbucket which has a few sprigs of ansible roles;
I'm optimistic the repo could grow into my s00p3r-s1mpl!f13d s0lu+ion
for migrating to new server when AB's flavor of Ubuntu falls out of
favor!
