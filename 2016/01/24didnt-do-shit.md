## 11:34 Sunday 24 January 2016 PST

We were scheduled to be at the wedding location at 10am to help set up
centerpieces.  I was up and ostensibly ready-within-5-minutes as Fred
repeatedly snoozed his alarm around 9 am.

He was like, "they won't be ready by 10am; arriving anytime between 10
and 11 is fine."

We arrived around 11:15.

All the centerpieces were done so we left.

Had I realllly cared to be there on time, I could have found another
driver.

Cheers to Fred for driving!
