Max bought a car for Noah so we could drive Francois and Flat Stanley
across the table.

Lin helped Noah with his kanji:

    ぼくの名まえはのあです。

    ぼくの母の名まえは千明です。

I spoke IT with Ivan; his company uses Oracle and some Python
frameworks I'd never heard of.  I told him about our setup and that I
haven't had to deal with team development much, being the only
developer in our company.

Chiaki has a website she hasn't updated in a while:
http://www.mamaism.org/

Outside, Noah was unimpressed with my barefoot preference.
