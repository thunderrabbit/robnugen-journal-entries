A-star is my suggested name based on the (stage) name for the woman
who greeted us first in a topless bar.  I liked her smile and eyes so
the third time she came up to me to see if we could go for a private
dance, I took her up on it.

We talked about her other talents in art and teaching people (how) to
do their own art.  She recommended some books (one called Opening Up,
which talks about ways of deepening one's own relationships) and
another, the name of which I've forgotten.

Given that I paid her over $100 for her time and energy, I hope she'll
email me.  (I gave her my card)
