Had a family outing with Joanna and Eric from San Francisco, who are
in town for a week.  I hadn't met Eric, but I had met Joanna briefly 4
years ago when Lin and I stayed at her family home (out of which she
had already moved) when we got married in the US.

I got to sit next to Eric at Its Vegetable (or is it It's Vegetable)
near Kinshicho(?) last night.  He's great at asking questions!  I need
to learn how to do that more naturally.  Best I could really do was
"how about you?"

He works at Google (jelly) and asked what cloud provider I use.  I
told him basically AWS, so we talked about that for a bit.

On my right were Takumi, Yuu at the head of the table, and Mikarin
across the table from me.  I showed them the two puzzles from Mayumi
which I had solved.  I was able to solve the butterfly one, but
interestingly couldn't get the horseshoe one solved, though I claimed
it was the easier of the two.
