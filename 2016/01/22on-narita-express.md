## 13:35 Friday 22 January 2016 JST

Lin and I are chillin on Narita Express #27, 1700 yen each from 品川
to Narita Airport (成田 ah crap I forgot this word)

I've just confirmed my packing and buying list was completed on time!

## 17:07  JST

Late start leaving, but we've just started boarding, 2 minutes after
departure time.

During the delay, I got an extra ticket done for CB.  yay!


## 19:33 JST / 2:33 Los Angeles

I feel sad that I got pissy when one of the ground crew(?) informed me
that I "must" wear shoes to get on the plane.  At first I was like, "I
don't have shoes; I have sandals in my bag"

When she walked away, I walked away, done no worries.

Well, she sent a local ground crew guy after me.  He smiled and asked
in English "where are your shoes?"   and I go "where are *your*
shoes??" and he laughed.

She came up all "you need to wear your shoes" (or something like that)
and I put my bag down saying something like, "okay jesus fucking
christ" and they both went away while I had my bag open, during which
time I determined that I do *not* have my sandals in this bag; they
are in my checked bag.

So I started walking toward the plane again and Lin admonished me to
calm down.  I agreed that I had acted inappropriately, but when she
was like, "so what do we do now without your shoes?" I go, "we just get
on the plane; they can go get my shoes off the plane if they want."

No other crew/staff said anything until I was actually on board.  (safe!)

A flight attendant goes, "where are your shoes?" and this time I was
more apologetic, "I'm sorry they're in my *checked* baggage"

she goes, "are you kidding me?"

"Sorry; I've been barefoot for 7 years so I didn't really think about
it."  I didn't explain further that when I was on Quantas, they didn't
bug me.

By the time we were seated (in row 40 because the rows are marked in a
confusing way and the couple designated for row 40 were in our row
(41)), the flight attendant brought me some slippers which Lin
surmised were from first class.

I hope I get a chance to apologize to the first crewmember for acting
like an ass, though I haven't seen her on board.
