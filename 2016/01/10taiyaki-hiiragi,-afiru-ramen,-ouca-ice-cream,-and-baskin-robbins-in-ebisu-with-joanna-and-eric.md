Title says it all, but actually I was the only one who ate at 31.  I
had Vani Vani Vanilla, but it wasn't as good as Popping Shower.

Taiyaki Hiiragi are the azuki bean filled pastries, ... and they were
*full*.

The ramen shop tasted like ramen to me, but it had come twice
recommended to Joanna.

Ouca ice cream was served with salty seaweed, which I thought was
gross.

We're still chillin' in Baskin Robbins now, with Snoop Dogg Ain't
Nothing but a G-Thang, and now MC Hammer 2 Legit to Quit playing on
overhead speakers.
