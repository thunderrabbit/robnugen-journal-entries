Oh man I just cried a bit after watching Bryn speak Vietnamese in a
video produced by the Consul General for Ho Chi Minh City.

Bryn was 1/2 my age when we joked about it back in 1996 or so.  Now
she's twice my stature and I realize my self limiting beliefs suck
more cocks than Apple.  Fuck I'm so stupid.

How ironic that just last night I wrote a note that I'm learning a lot
(related to Amazon Web Services) after talking to them for 1.5 hours
about an issue I'm seeing on our server.
