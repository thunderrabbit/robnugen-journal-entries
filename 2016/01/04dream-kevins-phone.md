<p class="lucid">I knew i was able to fly, and determined that I would beat the effects
of gravity, I tried various things to lift off the ground.  Then I
found that looking up allowed me to fly up; this
was great!  I was able to control my flight, even able to fly around in a small
space.  I was able to break through some walls repeatedly, and finally
the roof opened up for me.</p>

I hadn't previously been able to fly so close to the
ground without being attracted to it.

<p class="lucid">I didn't really go anywhere <i>per se</i> but I flew
along the highway for a bit.</p>

<p class="dream">In a room near the kitchen, teaching a lesson, I came
back in to the kitchen and found Kevin's phone was on the counter,
still connected. I remembered I had called him accidentally but it
must not have hung up.  I picked it up all "hello" and he immediately
goes "hello!  Who's been listening to my conversations?"</p>

<p class="dream">"No one! I called you by mistake a while ago. I was
in the other room teaching a lesson."</p>

<p class="dream">He goes, "hmm"</p>

<p class="dream">I didn't know what else to say, but realizing it was
a dream, I just woke up.</p>
