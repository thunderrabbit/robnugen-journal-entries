I haven't been able to log in to my local machine using ngrok.com
because of something I haven't probably figured out yet.  Earlier
today, I realized the problem must be that I'm trying to setcookie on
the wrong domain, or rather, on the domain my local box sees, and not
on ngrok.com.

I can't test it directly because I'm currently offline, but I tried to
break the cookie here locally, but I can still log in.  Dammit.

I should enjoy this moment when I'm upset that I can log in to
something.

I left the toy store early today so I could confirm I had found the
source of the problem, but I cannot confirm it.  So now I'm stuck in
the conveni which features hundreds of items I might consume if
hungry, and even some things I'm trying to resist buying now.

I just want to sleep.  Or actually I want to have web access.
