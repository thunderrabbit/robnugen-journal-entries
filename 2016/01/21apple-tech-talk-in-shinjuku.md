A bit boring, but talking to Mark in the QA room, I was able to get
some insight on how to handle some aspects of the app we're making.

    NSURLsession
    NSData  buffer , length
    gfxCardStatus

He also gave a good idea for how to put all the junk for each mode of
our game in separate views!  It should make the modal idea completely
unnecessary.  Woohoo!  Thanks, Mark!

The app is much better for having spoken with Mark and Stefan.
Instead of abusing the top bar with `Word List`, `Play Game` and `Play
Game`, it's now `Word List` and `Play Games`.  The Games tab brings up
a screen to select one or the other game.

Sweet.

I also met Guierrmo and saw Tom from iOS meetup.  Or he saw and
recognized me.

Tom and I walked back to Shinjuku station together.  He said he got a
lot out of the event, and he kinda helped me see a good side of Apple
and not just the poopy poop I keep complaining about.

Guierrmo gave me his card and said he can help or help me get in touch
with the right person!
