Great to get some extended time with closer family.  John (who danced
like a pro last night), Karen, and Maya (who politely refused to dance
last night) all had to leave a bit earlier, but we hugged them bye and
chatted about 35 more minutes during which time Mike de-res'd, and Lin
presented Karina with the にゃんがる hoodie featuring cat ears and a
pouch for cats (1 at a time, probably).
