Extracted from emails to Mayumi:

    Thank you for sending the lesson notes!  I'm glad you like yesterday's
    lesson style.  I hope to give all of you more speaking time!  If you
    think of any activities which might be fun, feel free to let me know.
    :-)
    
    I will be thinking of ways to make the lessons more interesting.
    one idea I have is to break up in pairs..  I think we should mix
    up the pairs each time so we have different partners each time.

Mayumi noticed the lesson yesterday was slightly different than ones I
taught last year.  I made fewer corrections and encouraged more
practice speaking.  Only trick is that the students are at different
levels, so I need to take that into consideration.
