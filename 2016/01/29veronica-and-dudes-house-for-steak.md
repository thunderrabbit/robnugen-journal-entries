Great time at Dude and Veronica's, where we ate steak, met their dog,
re-met their daughters, and I put a golf ball shaped ball on a tee
shaped stand inside a snowglobe type glass dome filled with
water-looking liquid.

Topics ranged from Fred's headache, to technology, to diaper porn, to
politics, to dogs, and everything in between.


Dude:

    Uber-style self driving car service will be available within 5 years.
    ubuquitous within 10 to 15 years.  (not by Jan 2026)

Rob:

    Uber-style self driving car service will be available within 4 years.
    ubuquitous within 7 to 9 years.  (by Jan 2025)
