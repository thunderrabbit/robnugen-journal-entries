It's actually not automated testing FTW yet; it's my choice to
carefully go through all the tests even though I am anxious to get the
changes to live server before I go on vacation FTW.

I have a list of tests that I was performing manually, and am now in
the process of performing them all manually just a couple more times
as I teach [Ghost Inspector](https://ghostinspector.com/) how to do
them for me.  While teaching Mr Ghost how to do a test, the server
didn't pass the test!  I was like, "awww crap!  Oh wait!  Wooo to the
Hooo!!!!" because I hadn't moved broken code online.
