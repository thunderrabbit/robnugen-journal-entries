Mark, Sumiyaki, Esther, and I attended ET contact night.  I had had
great optimism, but so far it hasn't panned out.  We were outside in
the progressively colder and colder air from 21:30 to 01:30, mostly
looking up at clouds until the very end after we said we were gonna go
and it unclouded to only 51% cover.  huh.

We stayed a bit longer, but are now inside.

I've brushed my teeth after eating snacks we all brought and shared.
Esther's apples were probably the best.

Woah I almost just now fell asleep here.  I'm gonna lay down.  I've
set an alarm for 3am, but I will probably ignore it.
