In the TESOL course, they just presented a story about a smart guy who
tried to learn a language just from books, and no practice.  I can't
imagine it's as literally true as they've presented it, but the point
is clear.  Books don't talk back. (*)

(*) Yes, I mean the old kind of books, the ones that were just made of paper and stuff.

    IQ might be correlated with learning a language in that a person with
    high IQ may be able to memorize a lot of grammar rules, exceptions,
    pronunciation guides, etc.  This person can more easily become
    well-read on the language, but not actually be able to *use* the
    language in a real situation.
    
    But I do not think IQ is related to acquiring a language.  Acquiring a
    language requires practice and simply attempting to speak without
    concern of one's errors.
    
    In one of the recent videos, it was suggested that people with high IQ
    want to maintain their appearance of being smart and therefore are
    less willing to make mistakes required for language acquisition.  I
    ain't so sure that IQ is the primary indicator of unwillingness to
    make mistakes.
