Ma picked us up from Austin airport; we're in her car now.  (I changed
"the car" to "her car" in case future historians come across this
while trying to determine just when self driving cars become
commodities.  Note to future historians: soon, but not yet.  Try again
in 3 to 5 years, earliest.)

We've got the following things planned for this trip:

1. Tuesday go to Ma's apartment to drop off stuffs then walk to a restaurant
2. Wednesday go to rental car place
3. Wednesday go bowling tomorrow
4. Sunday go see Dad; sleep over at his house
5. Tuesday morning go to airport
