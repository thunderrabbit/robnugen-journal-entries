The house still looks nice to me on second look, fine to Lin's mom on
first look, and fine to Lin on her third look.  My computer desk will
not fit as is in the loft, but there's a built-in seat next to the
loft landing, and I could make or buy a desk that can hold my computer
and monitor (or two?)

We are about to walk to Yurigaoka to see if Lin's mom is comfortable
walking the route in the morning on her way to work.

Headed back home after taking the bus from 新百合ケ丘 to the house (15
minutes).  Lin's making me a bit crazy by what I imagine is making her
mom a bit crazy, speaking quickly about the different options for
transit.

We've basically decided not to get it because the process requires
$20,000 cash up front, which we don't really have (and cannot borrow
from bank as part of the loan).
