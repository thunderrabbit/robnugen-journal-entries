Lin got a new suitcase!

I rotated one number on the lock while pressing the combination reset,
and now I cannot unlock the lock.  Fuck fuck fuck.  Lin just bought
this suitcase *today* and asked if I can set the combination to
something other than 000.

Done.

I have rolled through all the combinations with 2 zeroes, and I've
gone through the first 110 or so consecutive combinations.

I have tried making a [key for the lock](https://github.com/Xyl2k/TSA-Travel-Sentry-master-keys/blob/master/TSA007_stubby.stl) by cutting up a credit card
sized card.  Not successful so far.

Is it better to take the bag to an authorized place and pay 5000 yen(?)
to have them unlock it or keep going through combinations?

Got it.  I went through every integer combination (to no avail) but
then tried 0Â½0 and got it.  Now it seems to be reset to 000.

Receipt for the lock is here https://goo.gl/HIhwMv or here
