After an oopsy trip to Chiba, we went to the station after Yokosuka.
Got some Chinese food at a small shop with Chinese proprietors with
whom Joanna spoke a bit in Mandarin.

Went to see Eric's old house in the area, and in the same neighborhood
met an Australian guy named Geoffrey who had just moved into his house
9 months ago and has been reforming it since then.  Wow!  It looked
really nice, and he said it's the third house he's reformed in this
type of way, so Lin and I got his infos to see if we can have him work
on our new house, whenever we end up getting it.
