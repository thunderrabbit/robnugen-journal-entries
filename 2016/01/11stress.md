LM spent 1,500,000 yen on pachinko last year or so, devestating her
meager retirement savings.  I, C, and L have banded together to
support her, creating a new bank account and putting 30,000 yen into
the account per month while LM puts another 30,000 yen into the new
account (to which she has no access).

LM won't tell L how much LM needs per month to live.  I believe this
is because LM still has a problem with gambling and wants to hide
money to feed the addiction.  This simple point caused a bit of a
snippity conversation between LM and L.

LM doesn't want to live alone, and I believe she can still live with
her kid and kid's husband no worries, even if they move to a new
house.

Anyway, because of the touchy subject, when Lin forgot her cellie in
the rental car, I offered to go back with her and get it.  She was
like, "but I thought you have your men's group," and she wanted me to
say "I do, but I have to time; I have to go to the station anyway,"
but instead I was surly, and was like, "why don't you let me take care
of my schedule?  I know what time I have to go; I was just offering to
go with you because I thought it would be nice."
