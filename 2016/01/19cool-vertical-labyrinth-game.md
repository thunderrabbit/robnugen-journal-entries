At the toy store today, Mai asked if I had solved the circular
quadruple maze thing.  I have not.  But I assured her if I received it
as a gift, I would be able to solve it.  (I have a plan for how to
solve it, but it involves (temporarily) placing marks (removable
stickers) on the surfaces of the mazes.)

She said she would give it to me for 65,000 yen.  I resisted saying
how about 65,000 kisses because (I probably wouldn't and) it would be
inappropriate.

But I go, "don't you throw old shit away?" 古いものをすていますか？She
agreed and I asked what happened to the vertical ball game that had
been on the wall over there.  She said they still have it!

Long story short, they did *not* still had it; she and I were thinking
of other things.  The thing they still have is *better*.

AND, they said they'll happily give it to me if I simply take it.

Sweet.  I know what will be the first decoration in our new house!!
