I still like it.  Lin seems to still like it.

The refrigerator space is 75cm wide, and 60cm deep on the door side
(next to stove + sink counter), and 90cm deep on the hinge side.

Living+dining room is like 300cm by 650cm overall, with about 3x3
meters for each space.

Lin spoke with builder, who is also the agent.  I want to ask him

    What was the original price of the house?
    Are house values over the last 10 years trending up in this area?
    Are these cracks anything to worry about?
