We're about 25 minutes out.  Lin and I both slept well, so I'm pretty
sure we'll have no jet laggin' issues.

My sinus is quite itchy sneezy...  while my mouth was chewing the
grape that came with our breakfast, my nose was like, "time to
sneeze!!" and I had to work hard to override it!  I was thinking, "you
guys want some grapes???"
