Was fun but definitely not as life changing as I kinda guessed.  I'm
not sure if I'll be an addict, but I may go again.

We went twice today.  Got it on video the first time; the
videographers interviewed us at various points and we were all like
rar and stuff, plus Francois is there in the non-flight scenes.

We decided to jump again ($99) and I realized having the camera guys
there was kinda じゃま because the second time we just went up and
jumped.  But on the other hand, having them ask questions prompted
more enthusiasm, I guess... Kinda made it more exciting.
