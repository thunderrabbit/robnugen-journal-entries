## 10:35 Wednesday 27 January 2016 CST

Ma is driving Lin and I to county clerk's office to register our
marriage(!), which hasn't been officially done yet!

## 11:10

We have our marriage form thing which we can use to be certified as
married!

We went to the Travis County office because Ma knew they had pretty
licenses.  It works out for us because, Travis!

The deputy clerk beautifully enunciated "for all intents and purposes"
when explaining that the certified copy is essentially the same as the
original.

Now headed to REI to see if, in fact, they will replace my bag fo'
free.  I hope they can; I'd like to use it for all intensive purposes.
