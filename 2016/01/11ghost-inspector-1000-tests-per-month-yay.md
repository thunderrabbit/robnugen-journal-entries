A few days ago I signed up for [Ghost Inspector](https://ghostinspector.com/) and thought hmmm I'd love to have 1000
tests per month instead of just 100.

Boom they have that option!

    We're glad you're enjoying the product! Unfortunately, we don't
    offer any paid plans that are less than 10,000 test
    runs/month. However, we do have a promotion with Runscope (our
    parent company) where your free account will be bumped up from the
    100 test runs per month on the default free plan to 1,000 test
    runs per month if you sign up for both services.

I signed up for [runscope](https://www.runscope.com/) and set up an API test to boot!
