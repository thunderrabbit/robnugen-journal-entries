Lin and I are on 南武線 now to look at some houses near Yomiuriland!

## 15:37

Of the three houses we saw, we both agree on their order of
awesomeness.  The most awesome one has a loft, is built with old
school wooden building techniques, and features beams above the living
room upon which the cats and I can walk.  I'm not 100% sure they are
s00p3r str0ng enough to hold me easily, but I kinda bet they are.  For
the cats, they're quite fine.

Right now as I write this, we're on a bus heading to 百合ヶ丘 station,
the kanji for which is quite easy to write, so that's nice too.  Lin
is talking to a 75 year old woman who we met on the way to the bus
stop.  She seems quite genki for her age, possibly in part due to the
hills in the area.

Wow we're already at the station; that was quick!

But perhaps most importantly, we're within *walking* distance of
Yomiuri Land!!
