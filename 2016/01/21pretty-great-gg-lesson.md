I'm enjoying my recent lessons a lot more by being more focused on
having the students speak instead of correcting their errors.  I pick
out a few points perhaps, but basically allow them to chatter away as
long as I can essentially understand what they mean.

Today with GG, I did the same exercise as I did down in Fukuura: gave
instructions for drawing some lines, circles and dots.. The
instructions aren't perfect in that they won't result in identical
drawings in all correct interpretations, but they give some nice
listening practice as well as a chance to use "horizontal" and
"vertical" in a somewhat tangible way,.. and they allow me to string
together some prepositional phrases which may take some practice to
understand!

Specifically,

    ... in the center of the right side

which M thought she might interpret in a couple of different ways.

On our way back, we talked about Lin and my trip to the US.  M asked
if I had finished packing.  I invited her to ask me if I had *started*
packing!

She asked how long the flight would last: "negative 5 hours" and we
talked about jet lag a bit, which led me to talk about consciousness
training at [The Monroe Institute](https://www.monroeinstitute.org),
which led to discussion of life between lives and
[finding our purpose in life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN16ubqbJUA).

Anyway, good day!
