Jason's coming soon to pick us up!

## 14:59

Great time lunching and chatting with Jason while we ate and drove
around looking for skates for me.  I'm sorry I didn't know skates are
so 90's and unavailable so we didn't call to check before going to
_The DOMAIN_ on a proverbial wild goose chase and came back with
exactly that.  Goose egg.

We talked about Japan, Tokyo, his business, motorcycles, old days,
skates, Francois...  Plus Jason bought us lunch at Magnolia Grill!
Yay!!
