About 40 minutes before our flight, and I'm charging my computer a
little bit away from our gate because I'm addicted to my computer (and
therefore it having power) and don't know if I can get a power fix
closer to the gate.

In line at the deli kiosk thing where we grabbed some foodage, We saw
the cabin attendant who gave me slippers.  We chatted for a bit,
including how they'd prefer to go barefoot at times, but there's some
kind of rule (probably just to prevent lawsuits) that's in their
handbook.  Weird.  I'd like to get a license to go barefoot.  I wonder
if it's good internationally.  hahah


Email to ferp:

    We are in LAX, safely and slowly through immigration, safely and
    slowly through customs, safely and slowly through security, and
    grabbing a quick bite during our 3 hour layover of which less than
    an hour remains.
    
    We are due to arrive in Sandy Eigo at 1:47pm local time in
    America, the land of the free and home of the litigation!
