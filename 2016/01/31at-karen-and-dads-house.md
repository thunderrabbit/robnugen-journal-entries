Wow it's the last day of the month!

## 1:20 Monday 1 February 2016 CST

Okay Fred and I have been up playing Minecraft.

Before that, we ate ice cream, and before that, we went to H.E.B. to
get ice cream and fun toothpicks.  Before that, we ate at Serranos
(sp), and before that we took pictures after playing Sorry!

Before that, we hung out in the garden and I climbed the tree in the
front yard.  Before that we sat with the dogs on the stairs after
arriving at Dad and Karen's house.  Before that Fred drove us here,
and before that we said bye to kT at First Church after saying bye to
the YRUUers there after saying bye to Jackie and Paul after saying
Hello to the YRUUers after arriving at the church after getting
overnight stuff at Ma's apartment after eating at Magnolia Grill with
Jackie, Paul, kT, after hanging out at Ma's apartment after Paul and
Jackie came, after kT arrived after 10am.

or something like that.
