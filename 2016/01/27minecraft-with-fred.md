Yay!  Fred and I have finally played on the Minecraft (local) server
that I've been working on for well over a year.  It's a lot harder
when I'm in gamemode 0!  (that's zero, not one.)

We've barely gotten started seeing stuff, mostly just trying to stay
alive for a single night while monsters try to kill us.  Creepers have
exploded on my garden, and in the middle of my front yard.. I forgot
to take screenshots of the damage before covering over it with a
single layer of dirt.
