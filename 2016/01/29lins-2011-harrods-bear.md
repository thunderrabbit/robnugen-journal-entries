I didn't plan super well, but considered having the bear appear while
we went bowling, or as if it had appeared from the sky while
skydiving.

On second thought, a skydiving bear would take away from the skydive
itself, so I'm glad we didn't do that.

Anyway, I unceremoniously opened the box this morning, and the bear is
currently under the covers on Lin's side of the bed in Ma's apartment.
Lin *probably* won't find it until we go to bed tonight.
