Now, I'm not 100% sure this is a bug, but I reported to AWS a few days
ago:

    S3 bug: cannot create two lifecycle rules that apply to whole S3 bucket

That's just the title; I spelled it out a bit in the body of the
message.

But today I got back a steaming pile of useless reply:


    Hello Rob,
    
    This is ______ from the AWS Billing Department.
    
    Thank you for contacting AWS Billing and Accounts support.  I
    apologize for the issue you've been experiencing with S3.
    
    Unfortunately, the complexity of your question is outside our
    scope of knowledge here in Billing and Accounts ... blah blah

Okay so fine; I'm not paying for support, so my ticket gets low
priority.  But I didn't ask a question.  I'm trying to help out
Amazon.

If I remember, I will send them the identical message via an account
which has support as an option and see how they respond.
