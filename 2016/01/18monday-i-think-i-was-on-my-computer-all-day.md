I just noticed a gap in my recent journal entry dates.. I bet I was on
my computer all day Monday... oh but I remember I slept 12 hours (!!)
from 8pm to 8am after having a headache after (carrying my heavy bag
to and from) the ET Contact weekend at Pyramid Meditation Center near
Yanagawa station.

Being on my computer all day doesn't mean I *worked* all day, but
probably included watching an episode of Family Guy, which I remember
having done recently.
