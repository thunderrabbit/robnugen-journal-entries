I've decided that I like all electric for practical reasons: harder to
start a fire by forgetting chicken in the broiler; I also like it for
optimistic reasons: I like to think in the next N years while we live
there, zero-point energy technology will be open-sourced so we can
dramatically reduce our energy costs.

As I'm writing this, Lin's writing "shit stuff" on some kind of
registration form for the real estate company who will take us to see
the house.  The family is still in the house, so it will be
interesting to see their gear, but a bit like "hi sorry we're in your
house!"

Oh my gosh we loved it and loved them!  After seeing the house and the
surrounding area, we told the real estate agent YES, and we'll see if
the bank agrees.

Here's what I wrote on Lin's phone (because my phone's battery had died)

    The house is fucking fantastic and in a great location. Plus great
    insulation on most of the windows and plenty of space ace for Mama to
    live hang clothes etc. cats have ample space to chill and there's a
    fun place to watch downstairs from the top of the stairs.
    
    I'm seriously thankful for the place
    
    Interesting point is they don't yet have a place in mind to move so I
    was thinking they can sell to us and then rent from us.  Turns out
    Japan is Japanese and that kinda thing is "difficult" So instead they
    can just take their time to look because we have plenty of time to
    wait. I'm happy to stay in touch with the family because I felt really
    nice energy from the mom and daughters, a sibling of whom appears to
    be on the way!
    
    Right now 3:17pm we are rolling round the good as he's showing us
    stuff to which I am paying little attention hahaha

The real estate company had done an inspection on the house just 6 months before, and it passed with great marks on all sides (including foundation and roof!)
