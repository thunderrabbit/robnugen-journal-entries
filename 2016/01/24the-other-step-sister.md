Today we all went to a pizza party including several members of the
family, then Fred and I took Lin to meet our step sister Elise (not
her real name).  We played with the kids outside on the trampoline,
played with the dogs inside the house, and went out for ice cream (Lin
got Cake Batter flavor), some coffee (at a chain), and some yummy
drinks (at a big retailer).

We got back, chatted for a while about injuries, and the Fred left his
jacket when we left for the second party, where we got to see Mike
Alvez and several other peeps, including our step sister's fiance's
friend from the Appalachian Mountains.  I dumped a handful of Japanese
coins into his daughter's hand.  She seemed to like them enough that I
gave them to her after making sure it would be okay.

After the dinner, Lin was hella tired so we took her to the hotel and
then went back to Elise's with the puzzles I got for Fred (except for
the dual maze one).  Played with them for a while, and Elise got down
the other puzzles she had (including two Fred had made for her.

Everyone took a turn on the puzzles, and we determined that the linked
nail puzzle is impossible because every solution showing them on
YouTube shows a different starting cofiguration.
