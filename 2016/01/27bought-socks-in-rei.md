We didn't buy an ice cream making ball, and didn't replace my
backpack, but Travis(!) printed a receipt for my backpack purchase in
San Francisco back in 2011.

We did buy socks, though, especially after the girl with a 1 cm plug
in her ear lobe helped check the size by opening up the package for
me.

Outside (and inside) Lin took a few pics which I hope the guy from
Tokyo TV will be able to use in the broadcast.
