Three people are in an apartment: Rob (American, slightly unshaven),
Fred (younger brother, very unshaven), Lin (attractive asian-looking
woman)

Rob: `            Okay guys, let's go skydiving!`

The trio walk outside into a glorious sun filled afternoon and head to
the parking lot.

Fred: `           Dude.  Where's my car?`

Rob: `            Aw man this ain't cool.`

Lin: `            Where did you park it?`

Fred immediately calls someone on the phone.  Rob and Lin overhear
Fred speaking to an unknown character named MA.

Fred: `           ... so can you come take us to the skydiving place?`

Fred: `           Okay.  Okay thanks bye`

Fred rejoins Lin and Rob.

Fred: `           yeah so apparently they tow.`

Rob: `            fuckers`

Lin: `            Oh Fred I'm sorry!`

Fred's phone rings again.

Fred: `            Hello?`

Fred: `            Oh! Okay.  See you in a sec.`

Fred (to Rob and Lin): `She's going to swap apartments with us.`

`                  We'll take her car and they'll stay here`
