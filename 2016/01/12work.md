Today at CB we met at 3pm because their Monday meeting was pushed back
to today at noon, when I normally meet Satomi.  But so I met her at
3pm and we got ticket 2748 updated with her new image.  It's up on
demo2 now, and I hope they'll approve it soon.

I also explained why the FS server had ground to a halt last week:
lack of storage space due to lack of rotating a log file which had
grown to be 11 GB.  oops!
