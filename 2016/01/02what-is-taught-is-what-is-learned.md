Here's my answer to the statement "What is taught is what is learned"

    What is taught is definitely not what is learned.  Students focus
    on whatever they focus on.  The instructor may be talking about
    blah blah blah, but the student might be focusing on their navel,
    their cellphone, etc.  In this case, what is taught is for naught.
    As we learned early in this course, students are busy forming
    their opinions about the teacher's ability to teach instead of the
    topic itself, and that's just in the first 6 seconds of class.
    
    So imagine the case where the students love the instructor and
    hang on his/her every word and nuance.  Even then, each individual
    student has their own unique way of perceiving the world.  Through
    life experiences, our perceptions are colored/filtered via our
    past, which is unique for every person.
    
    Only for infants, starting with a blank slate of experiences, are
    their perceptions unfiltered.  But in that case, there's too much
    information and not enough context for the infant to know what's
    what.
    
    The above examples are all the extremes.  In the optimal
    situation, students enjoy the class, enjoy learning, and have just
    the right life experiences to focus on exactly what the teacher
    hopes to teach.  Assume these students do their best to acquire
    the language, working outside the class, in their own time,
    possibly in 'real life' situations.  They study and practice and
    sooner than later, improve their skills. but that was due to their
    practice more than what was taught.
