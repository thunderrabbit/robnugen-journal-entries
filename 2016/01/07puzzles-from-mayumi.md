Extracted from emails to Mayumi:

    At this point, I've only solved one puzzle.  I tried briefly to solve
    one of the others, but was unable to do so after a few minutes.
    
    But, more importantly, yes you guys certainly made great progress on
    the one I finished for you!  It's a variant of one of my grandad's old
    puzzles.  In a way, it's mathematically a variant of the round black
    puzzle I showed you (with pegs that move in and out).
    
    
    Regarding the puzzle, actually that one is the most difficult!  I was
    able to solve the long chain puzzle in about 3 minutes, and I solved
    the butterfly-looking puzzle in about 6 minutes.  The last one I still
    haven't fully solved!  (I'm trying to get the puzzle back to its
    starting position, but can only get about 1/8th of the way there.
    (1/8 is my estimate, but if I understand the puzzle correctly, I'm
    certainly not more than 1/4 of the way there, and I could be as far as
    1/16th!  I believe you guys had it between 3/4ths to 7/8ths solved!)

The puzzles were apparently from a 100 yen shop.  They're still neat
and different than puzzles I've seen before.

The easiest one is similar to a linked horseshoes puzzle.

The second easiest features some rings wrapped / trappe on a curvy wire frame.

I still haven't solved the last one.  I'm 99% sure it requires recursion.
