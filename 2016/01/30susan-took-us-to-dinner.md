After the wedding ceremony, we all headed to steak dinner at McCormick
and Schmicks, where we were all graciously hosted by Ma's friend
Susan.

Super cool that kT and Susan have (had) jobs in similar sectors so
they chatted in secret code about that for a while.

Susan has written a book called [Bench-Pressed](http://smile.amazon.com/Bench-Pressed-Recounts-Blessings-Lessons-Immigration/dp/1475975422/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8), which she felt
compelled to write after serving as a judge within the immigration
system in the US.

Lin got sirloin steak (which she said was over cooked though she asked
for medium rare) and I got parmesian chicken.  Most of us got crème
brûlée for dessert.

Susan dropped me and Lin off at Ma's apartment, and I guess dropped
off Ma at her car at her apartment complex.

I confirmed with Jackie that kT is in town and may meet us in the
morning when Jackie and Paul come take us for breaky!
