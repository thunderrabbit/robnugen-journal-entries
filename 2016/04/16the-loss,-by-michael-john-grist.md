I'm on the ARC (Advanced Review Crew (or something)) for British
Mike's books.  (Playing ultimate back in the day, we had Canadian Mike
and British Mike.)

ABout a month ago we received the advanced review copy of [The Loss -
Zombie Ocean 4](http://www.michaeljohngrist.com/2016/04/the-loss-zombie-ocean-4/)
and today I finished it!

This is the fourth book in MJG's Zombie Ocean, and it's easily the best of the series so far! The world is really opening up; the first three books have created the world from different viewpoints.. and now we get to live in it (and a few get to die in it!)

The first half sets up an amazing backstory for some characters who only had very minor parts in the first few books. These new characters have huge character arcs (moving me from "I love you" to "I despise you").... But most amazingly, I can really see why they acted the way they did! It's so great to see the sweet side of characters who also have such a dark side.

The second half of the story begins with a road trip to the big fight. It all happens in such a short timeframe, but the action never stops.

In addition to MJG's ability to create characters, he can really create some wrenching violence. Due to characters suffering such agony, I had to put the book down on two different occasions, and one of those times I nearly passed out!

This book follows two sets of characters in two different settings. One story is told through the Chapters, and the other story is told through the Interludes. Each story pulled me along... always hoping for the best, but assuming the worst. (Thanks, Mike!)

We get to see more zombie action, and the zombies do something we haven't seen before in any of the other books.

But wait, there's more!! More unfinished stories! More books to
come!!! I'm looking forward to them!
