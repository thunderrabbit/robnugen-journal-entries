Been working lots and studying lots; 2 different teachers, 5 lessons
per week this week.  I will try a new face to face teacher on Sunday
(via Jon and Paola), and see if it's worthwhile to *go* somewhere
instead of just doing lessons on Skype..

Been working on AB; I've added a quick little system that acts as a
reminder for AB to contact their clients every once in a while and be
like "wazaaaa" ..  There will be a little list to notify them.  ah
crap I forgot to add the dashboard notification as well.  I'll have to
do that after my online meetings tonight.

Next meeting is in 37 minutes with Soness for making a TEDx Worthy
Application.  (not building the speech per se; just building the
application to do the speech!)
