Today was my fifth lesson with SS, and it seemed like they enjoyed it.
I'm really trying hard to use the techniques I'm learning in my TESOL
class online, and it really seems to work!

This week we continued with the vocab words I presented last week.  We
didn't quite finish the exercise, so I said we'll continue next
week.. I hope that works out!
