1 page on why, what, and how

oh my goodness this is embarassing to write on my online
journal. Fortunately I only have 1 reader, and he's probably gotten
bored and wandered away.

I know for a fact that I won't keep this up every day, but the why is
currently related to productivity, which is related to thinking I did
something good, which is related to thinking that *I'm* good.

My wildly important goal for the day is to make a plan for finishing
the TESOL capstone course.  Why? because I've already put several
hours into it, and not finishing would help validate my claim that I
can't finish projects.  Why else is because I can see how the TESOL
courses have helped me be a mo betta teacha.

I already spent 20+ minutes on it, so I'm going to meditate for 5 mins
and then do 15 mins of MOOV (maybe should do the MOOV first) so I can
thoroughly break my train of thought good lord this isn't going well
is it.

Yesterday I got to level five in fucking Pokemon Go.  Fred said yeah
you might as well so you know what they're talking about.
