The previously written entry was written on Wednesday night.  I've
been toting my computer around today Friday, and spent an hour working
on some worksheet for possible new class starting in September, after
deploying a new version of CB websites.

In today's advanced class, I talked about fiat currency and WTC7, and
the students were like "realllllyyyyy?????" so I invited them to look
it up.

Interesting to know what they have to say about it next week, though
half of the students won't be there next week.  He'll be on a business trip.
