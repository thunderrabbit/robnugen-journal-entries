I like David Hu's answer in Khan Academy's time management thing:

### David Hu

* I work from 9:30 - 6:30
* I start by journalling 1 page on: why, what, and how. I come up with 1 “wildly important goal” that I schedule my day around.
* I spend 10 mins on my morning checklist — scheduling the day, checking calendar, quick check of Slack, status update.
* I’ll spend two solid 2-hour blocks, one in the morning, and one in the afternoon, on the wildly important goal. I close Slack and email during this time. Sometimes, I’ll go to a cafe too.
* I use the Pomodoro technique — 25 min working, 5 min break. I meditate during breaks to calm and re-center.
* I keep a spreadsheet of how focused I was on each Pomodoro work session. I ask my manager to look at that spreadsheet each week to keep me accountable.
* I spend 5-10 mins at end of day reflecting — what I’m happy about, what I’m worried about.
