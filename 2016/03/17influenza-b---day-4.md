yeah wow this is my first entry in a while; I've had influenza (type
B, not that I think I'd know the difference) and it's taken my voice
somewhere for going on 40 hours now.  I'm barely beginning to get it
back; there seems to be one pitch that works but the rest are just
raspy air.

I'm going to the clinic today, but I can't speak!  hmmm

I printed this note for the doctor:

    Today I feel about 80% of my energy back
    
    My bowels are better, and I can eat
    
    but I cannot speak!  It's been 44 hours that I cannot speak
    
    I still cough a little bit, but my lungs are mostly clear

Dr didn't give me any more meds; he predicted I'll be able to work
again on Tuesday.  Wow.

Total charge: 380 yen ($3.80)

I asked for a note indicating that I wasn't allowed to work, and got a
sealed envelope for 2700 yen ($27).
