At SS lesson, we described a picture, and practiced asking questions
based on the descriptions.  We then played a game where teams created
questions for a new picture and then took turns asking as the other
team answered (without looking at the picture).

That took most of the time.  Focus was on correctly using is/are
appropriately, and use of the phrase "at least"

In the remaining ten minutes, we went through "Grade 3 Sentence
Completion 1" worksheet from this page
http://www.englishforeveryone.org/Topics/Sentence-Completion.htm
