I've just moved online some code for AB to hopefully easily and
smoothly correct the data that was messed up and then not corrected
perfectly last week.

Basically the correction assumed all values started at 0, so didn't
write 0 where it thought it didn't need to.  So this time I will set
everything to 0 first before fixing the data.

But the main issue is that the data is being updated on day-to-day
basis incorrectly.  I'll need to tweak that once the historical data
is all fixed.
