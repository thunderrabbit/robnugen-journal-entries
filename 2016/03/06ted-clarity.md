So it took a bit of time, but we have finally
double-triple-quadruple-confirmed that our cat Ted will our neighbor's
cat Ebu because Ted enjoys our neighbors house more than ours.  Sad to
see him go, but happier to see him happier there than here.
Apparently he sleeps with her each night, whereas he rarely/never
slept with us.
