blah

this is day 6 of Influenza B, which started on Monday officially.  A
couple days ago on Thursday the doctor predicted I'd be able to work
on Tuesday, and even didn't give me any more medication.  Yay, but now
booo because I can't tell that I'm realllllly getting better.

My voice isn't fully back, but it isss better a bit, but I've had no
voice for like 3 or 4 days now.  blah.

Kevin has asked if I can help with his site, and I'm like man I wish.
dang.  My brain is just like sidetracked and hard to focus.
