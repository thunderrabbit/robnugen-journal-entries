Mutsumi told me she'd like to be pera pera in English by 2020 for the
Olympics in Tokyo.  I told her it's quite a good goal and I'll support
her in doing it!  The first (four) steps are to practice practice
practice practice.

I told her I'm taking 3 Japanese lessons per week because I really
wanna improve my Japanese (until I change my mind again　かな。。) but
for now, fuckit, three lessons a week.  I know I could go even harder
core than that, but this is prolly good enough for me for now.

Anyway, the lesson was good; we looked at her homework because she's
still kinda shy to speak..  Maybe I can look up some good exercises /
suggestions to encourage speaking even so.
