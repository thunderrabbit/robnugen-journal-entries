I bought a copy of Francois in case I ever lost him.  But the copy
wasn't the same color, so the new rabbit became Francine, Francois'
girlfriend.

Sydney decided she loved Francois and that he should be her rabbit,
and I was like, "yeah nah" because I've had Francois longer than she's
been alive.

But, I said I'd be happy to send Francine to her.

I took a few snaps first
