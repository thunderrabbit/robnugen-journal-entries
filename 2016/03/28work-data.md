HI AB!

some good news: I found a mistake in the data

surprising news: correcting the mistake will make the dom value even a little lower.

I found a mistake in the data for unit 64935 

The values are all correct all the way down through December 2015.  The value of dom for January 2016 should be 0, but it listed as 43.

The value of 43 for January 2016 was incorrectly calculated before I fixed the data last week.

The fix last week wrote correct values from August 2015 - December 2015.   It should have written January 2016 as 0, but because the correct value is 0, the fix assumed the value was correct and didnâ€™t write anything.

I will re-fix the data for September 2015 - March 2016 to write value 0 if it should be 0.

Again feel free to email or call if you have questions.
