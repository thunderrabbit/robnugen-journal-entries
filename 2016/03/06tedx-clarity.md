Soness has spoken at a couple TEDx events, and given her extensive
training and experience on stage, I figure she can help me figure out
how to speak at Pecha Kucha, where I'd like to present a presentation
on authenticity.

Synchronistically, Soness is leading an online workshop thing called
[TED Worth Application](https://soness.teachable.com/courses/ted-worthy-application/),
which I'm taking!

Question 1:

    Who are you?  What's your message worth spreading?
	    
        I attended a transformational weekend in 1997 called New Warrior
        Training Adventure, organized by Mankind Project https://www.mkp.org/
        
        It gave me a safe space to express my fears, my successes, my sadness,
        my true self.  Whatever I needed to say or express was welcome.  I
        stood shoulder to shoulder with men who were courageous enough to
        simply be there for one another, no matter what the circumstances.
        
        So now we are creating a small group in Tokyo, looking for a few men
        who are looking for authentic connection.  Based on my training and
        the book _A Circle of Men_ by Bill Kauth, we talk about "real"
        topics.
        
        Some recent questions included:
        
        "What's the most difficult challenge coming up in your life?"
        
        "What's one thing you believe you should but are having trouble doing
        it?"
        "What's keeping you from doing it?"
        
        We aren't there to "fix" people.  We don't give advice or tell you
        what you should do.  We simply give a safe place for you to get
        everything out, so *you* can look at it; so *you* can find your own
        best solution.  We hold each other accountable once we make a
        decision.
        
        Anyway, all of this requires trust and speaking honestly.  The word
        I've been using the describe it is "Authenticity"
        
        What if we were authentic with each other?  What if we could answer
        "how was your day" with "I feel sad" ... and for that to be okay?  No
        reason to *stop* feeling sad.  Just be sad and honor the emotion.
        Take a few minutes for yourself to just sit and feel sad.  I'll sit
        with you.



Question 2:

    If you are hearing that “you’re not good enough” voice, what does it say?
        No one cares what I want to say
    
    Do you want to quiet that voice? Declare your intention now.
    What’s your intention?
        I often find people who are interested in authentic sharing
    
    How does that intention fit with your purpose for speaking?
        Many people will be touched + intrigued by the message and enjoy
        speaking authentically with others.
    
    Who needs to hear your message?
        People who care enough to be honest with themselves and others
    
    What voices would you like to hear instead? What do they say?
        Wow that's right!  I'm so thankful to have a safe space to speak.
        When does your group meet?
    
    Who are 3 people that you’re going to have in your seats
    with loving, compassionate, and supportive voices?
        J, T, M, S, P, L
