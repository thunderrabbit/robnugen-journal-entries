Had a good meeting with AB today, but apparently there's a bug with
how some data is being archived.  Fortunately the data exists and I
just have to tease it back out of the raw data, but I wonder why they
didn't tell me sooner.  And I wonder why my data checker didn't
notice.  maybe it's been misreporting all along?  yikes stripes.
