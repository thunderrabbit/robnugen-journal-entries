## 11:35 Thursday 24 March 2016 JST

Lesson this morning was short because my student was late as usual.  I
spoke with Matt on the way out of the building; told him that I'm
teaching the PPSS lessons starting soon.

Online i-group started an hour earlier due to US clocks springing
forward so I was a tiny bit late for that.

Now I'm about to work on AB site.
