Now we are headed to a hot foot bath, which I guess is <ruby><rb>足温
泉</rb><rt>足おんせん</rt></ruby> in
Japanese.  Oops it's <ruby><rb>足湯う</rb><rt>あしゆう</rt></ruby>

Good for me since I'm barefoot, and it's about 3C outside.

mmmmm that was nice.  Also nice to talk to some of the locals.  I
dropped the anger that usually comes up when people tell me how "good"
my Japanese is, and just talked to them the best I could.  They asked
which country I was from, then about Trump, then how long we had been
in Niigata.  "Two days" gained us "welcome to Niigata" in reply.
