Neat!  The woman sitting behind Lin bought a cup of coffee with a
cellophane plastic top through which she poked the straw to access the
coffee.  She put the cup in her cup holder and fell asleep.

Then we went up into the mountains and the pressure inside the cup
gently squirted coffee out through the straw.
