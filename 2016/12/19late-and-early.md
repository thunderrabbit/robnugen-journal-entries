I have Japanese lessons until 11:30pm tonight, and then have to leave
the house at 6:30am tomorrow.

Tonight will be my first lesson with 文子先生, though I'm not sure if

At first she suggested Genki I, and then was like no wait Genki II,
when I tore through a lot of Genki I.

My homework is to write sentences for my arch nemesis: くれる
