There's a huge number of birds outside; I mostly hear crows, but there
may be others.  They sound a bit far away, but quite plentiful in
numbers..  The sound seems to come in waves.  Ohh Mikako was saying
there are tons of geese or maybe she said swans, for which Niigata is
famous.  This sound must be coming from them.

Nope; Mikako they were crows!
