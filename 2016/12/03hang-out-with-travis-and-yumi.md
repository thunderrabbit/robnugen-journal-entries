Sweet!  Lin and I hung out with Yumi and Travis, respectively, in
Shinjuku for a couple of hours, and an hour, respectively.

(as I write this, the above sentence seems comprehensible)

Lin called me while I was working at home, and kinda in a
break-needing stage, so I jumped at the chance to meet Travis, for
what I suspect is the last time before he starts his new project(s).

I told them it would take an hour to get there, but I made good time
by jogging most of the way to the station (I made 13 minutes of a
25-minute walk) and *just* caught the express train to Shinjuku.

I felt sorry for the other passengers cause I was a bit sweaty and
stinky on the train after having jogged a lot of the way.

Ate at Bangkok House or something and then went to a pay-by-weight
frozen yogurt place called Menchies or something.  I got a bit over
300 grams apparently.

Travis and I talked computer stuff, and Yumi and Lin talked girl
stuff. I'm so happy that they're such good friends.  Travis talked
about how "multi-tasking" at programming projects loses a lot of time (in
context switching), and I was like "yep; I'm experiencing that now,"
with (multiple) iOS projects, websites for AB, and CB, plus trying to
get sb's servers all Ubuntu 16ed.  This time, using Ansible, instead
of blah blah by hand.  Oh, plus https://www.krimms.com/ which I just
finished for Simon in exchange for four (4) oz of .999 pure silver
coins.
