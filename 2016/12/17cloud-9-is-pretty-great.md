I'm going through a
[Ruby on Rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning)
which suggests using [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/).  It's pretty amazing
that this is available free of charge.

It gives me unlimited public workspaces where I have a unix shell,
ability to run all sorts of applications.  The ones I care about now
rails, git, emacs.. yay!

Rails.
