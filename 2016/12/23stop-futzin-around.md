We stopped in a rest stop at 9:47, and the driver was like "gonna
leave at 10 sharp so..."

So I bought a drink and headed back to the bus, and honestly got a bit
panicked when I couldn't find it (because I hadn't carefully noted its
location based on *immobile* surroundings. (okay okay I didn't really
note the location based on anything but a vague angle toward the rest
area entrance)).  Thank you, old man, who beckoned me around the new
buses which parked in front of our bus.

But Lin was still buying her drink and the timer was ticking 9:55:40
tick tock tick tock; she came on time, but she *also* got confused
when she couldn't see our bus, but thank me, her husband, for standing
where I could see her and the bus and holler "babychan!" when she
started walking the same wrong way I had to evaluate the other buses.

We got on the bus with 90 seconds to spare.  At 10:00, the driver got
up, counted the passengers (twice, I think) as he walked up and down
the aisle. 10:01 vroom vroom we're off, but the front middle passenger
seat is empty *except for a purse*.  Yikes.

(The title is in honor of Swa'vet (1975 (or so) ~ 2007 (or so)) who,
while I was standing right next to her, said to me "stop fuckin'
around and call me," much to my amusement given that she had *just*
given me her number (and meant for me to call her later)).
