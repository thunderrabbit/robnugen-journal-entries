I really like my new Japanese teacher Fumiko.  She's apparently got a
certificate or license to teach Japanese, and it shows.  BUT I
correctly identified 苦手 as an adjective while she thought it was a
noun for a second.  (not noun/名刺 mixup)

Anyway, I might be learning at a fractionally faster rate.
