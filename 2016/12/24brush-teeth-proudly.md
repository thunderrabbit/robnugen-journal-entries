<p class='dream'>Was at someone's house like family reunion and  wanted to get away
from it all</p>

<p class='dream'>Girl was beautiful but couldn't skateboard, and we took the time to
teach her to skateboard.  She went from zero ability to basically
being able to skate.  I gave her a congratulations hug and kiss at the
end and she thanked me for taking time to help her learn.</p>

<p class='dream'>So I was all alone in the narrow bathroom (my shouldrs could touch /
were compressed between the wall and the glasss door, and I was
brushing my teeth and crying a little.  Mama saw me and was like "yo
man you gota brush your teeth proudly outside" and made a big show of
how it was important to be proud, etc.  I called her stupid stupid
stupid and then said sorry, but then was like, "oh yeah well what's
the difference between cleaning my teeth alone and you washing your
face alone or trimming your moustace hair alone?" and she got all
quiet and other people were like "what's up?" and I go "Mama wants me
to brush my teeth outside, but I don't see her logic," to one guy and
then we both said at the same time, "because there is none."</p>

<p class='dream'>Then Lin was committing some changes to a repository at her work, and
I was helping her with that</p>

<p class='dream'>Oh, also I dreamt there were some guys playing frisbee out in a big
field; I joined them and we threw for a while.  Some of my ultimate
friends came and asked if we were going to play ultimate, and I said I
didn't know, but was just going to throw and be happy.</p>

Going back to sleep for a bit.
