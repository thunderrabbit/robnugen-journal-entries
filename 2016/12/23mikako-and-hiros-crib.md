## 15:10 Friday 23 December 2016 JST

We're at M and H's place in Niigata.

The current plan is to go bowling, and/or see swans, and/or go to a
shrine, and/or see the ocean, and/or see nature, and/or watch a movie,
and/or eat at a buffet, and/or play magination, and/or take a nap.

We played with magnets and now taking a nap.  They are; I'm not.  I'm
uploading photos and stuff.
