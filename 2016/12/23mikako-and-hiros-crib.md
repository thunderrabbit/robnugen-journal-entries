We're at M and H's place in Niigata.

The current plan is to go bowling, and/or see swans, and/or go to a
shrine, and/or see the ocean, and/or see nature, and/or watch a movie,
and/or eat at a buffet, and/or play magination, and/or take a nap.

We played with magnets and now taking a nap.  They are; I'm not.  I'm
uploading photos and stuff.

We rented two movies: Transcendence with Johnny Depp, and San Andreas
(Japanese title カリフォルニアダウン) with Dwayne Johnson.

Bought some food at a bakery, stopped by a bag outlet (that's
apparently making enough money to buy the next lot and make bag outlet
2) where we saw some good bags, but none had all the features that I want:

* roller bag with
* easily replaceable wheels
* super strong handles
* super strong backpack straps
* computer pocket big enough to hold computer and books (total 10 cm thick)
* compartment big enough for my big shoes
* separate compartment for pens and toiletries
* waterproof

I'm having trouble finding more than 2 or 3 of these requirements in a
single bag.

If it could double as a chair and have an awesome guarantee, I could
forgo the backpack part, which probably makes it a lot easier to find.

After looking at bags, we went to a chinese restaurant where we got
too much food for our own good hahaha.
