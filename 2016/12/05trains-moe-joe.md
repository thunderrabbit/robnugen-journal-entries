Bah I chose the wrong door to get on the train; there are fewer seats
available here so I'm sitting on the bumper next to the wheel chair
space, propping my computer on the rail beside me, holding it down
with my left wrist while I write.  Basically it's the worst thing I
can do for my wrist; I can feel it burning.  Okay fine I'll just chill
and hope a seat opens up.  (tiny chance)
