(written 10:37 Tuesday 27 December 2016 JST)

We took the bullet train home.  So much faster than the bus!  No
electrical outlet on this particular train though, so I didn't write
anything on my computer.  But I did take a ton of pictures, not all of
which I will post here.

Or should I?  Hmmmmm.

Okay I pulled them all down from my camera (via
https://photos.google.com), and I'm pushing them up to
https://b.robnugen.com now via
[Mountain Duck](https://mountainduck.io/), which gives an interface
into Finder for drag and drop.  I kinda think it will fail and I'll
have to whip out the command line and actually copy and paste some
directory names.

Wow it finished without crashing!  273 MB in 38 minutes.  Finder never
figured out the time remaining though.

## 11:36

Hmmm though now Finder says "Copy 0 items [...]" and hasn't closed the
window.  I wonder if it's busy closing file handles or something
equally silly.

## 11:38

It finished.  Now let's see if the images were actually copied.

Nice.  They're all here
