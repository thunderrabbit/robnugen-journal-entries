We are at Swan Lake in Niigata, where swans apparently gather for the
evenings in winter.  There are none here now.

Several came back starting around 4:30pm, right when the sky was
getting dark.

But even cooler than seeing swans flying was seeing the window through
which we could see them! 1.7m tall by 12 meters wide. One pane of
glass.  Thanks to the lady for actually getting out a tape measure to
measure its length and height.
