I wish I could partake in sleeping time right now, but I'm in a glass
room and ostensibly on the clock, though have no students here yet.

Great online I-group.  They helped me recognize why I feel angry when
things are wasted.  Basically when people waste things, I think that
means they don't care about the environment.  Part of me doesn't care
about anything, so I'm projecting that part of me onto people.

But that's not why I'm writing.  I'm on a train having just left
Tachikawa.  My 2pm - 5pm lessons at the museum are *next* week, so I
got to engage in a nice nap on Nambu line on the way to Tachikawa, and
I might take another nap on the way to Akihabara.
