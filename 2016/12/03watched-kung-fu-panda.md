Lin and I watch Kung Fu Panda on Netflix, which was cuter and better
than she expected.  I recognized Jack Black's voice, but didn't
recognize Angelina Jolie nor Lucy Liu's voices.  I thought I
recognized Liam Neeson as Master Shifu, but it's actually Dustin
Hoffman.

Is there a voice-matching site?
