I plan to work for a bit to create an English version of a website and
then head out to SOGO.  The weather looks stunningly good.

The weather was great.  Workout was great.  Some of the organizers
were hung over, and others were hung over enough to not attend.

Eric invited people to Crayon House (vegan buffet) to which I had been
once before; it was great this time as well.

Sat with Tanuja, who's been in Japan one year longer than I, and
Masako, who's been in Japan longer than both of us put together.
