Lin and I just completed a small piece of art I titled *Lin's Heart*
because it started with a heart shape which she drew in light blue. We
took turns drawing on it.  It's not exactly an exquisite corpse,
because she chose the colors each time we drew on it, and we each only
drew with one color at each swap.

I kinda want to make an art website; maybe I should re-start uploading
to Tumblr, Canvas, and then post items for sale on the bitcoin one.
(I wonder if it's getting more traction.)

I've just named the four pieces started on the bus today:

* Nigata
* Niigata
* Lin's Heart
* Nivgata

The romanization of 新潟 gave me the naming idea.

It looks like we're in Niigata now, plus the announcement said the
next stop is the last stop for this bus.  I thought the driver said
we'll be there by 13:30, so I guess we might be earlier than expected
(or it's further from "last stop" announcement to the last stop than I
imagine) (or both).
