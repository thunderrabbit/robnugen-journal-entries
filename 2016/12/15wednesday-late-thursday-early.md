## 07:48 Thursday 15 December 2016 JST

My transition from Wednesday to Thursday each week includes just about
4 hours of sleep.  I work until 9pm at JB (get home at 10:40pm) and
then teach at 7:50 the next morning (for which I wake up at 5:49am).
So I guess if I go zoom straight to sleep, I could sleep 7 hours.
I'll try that next year when the schedule resumes after the holidays.

Today I'm pretty tired, have a headache, and didn't enjoy the crowded
train on the way here.  (if I'm awake and 元気 it doesn't phase me)
