## 07:48 Thursday 15 December 2016 JST

My transition from Wednesday to Thursday each week includes just about
4 hours of sleep.  I work until 9pm at JB (get home at 10:40pm) and
then teach at 7:50 the next morning (for which I wake up at 5:49am).
So I guess if I go zoom straight to sleep, I could sleep 7 hours.
I'll try that next year when the schedule resumes after the holidays.

Today I'm pretty tired, have a headache, and didn't enjoy the crowded
train on the way here.  (if I'm awake and 元気 it doesn't phase me)

Not saying these are related, but they are not entirely not related.
