Fujisawa is the last stop on this branch of the Odakyu Line.  (Another
terminal is Odawara.)

I'm not yet sure which trains pass which other trains by the time they
get to our station.

But at least I can easily get a seat if I want.

barf.  I would swear the sign said this train was going all the way to
Shinjuku, but now it's terminating in Sagami Ono.  What happened???
