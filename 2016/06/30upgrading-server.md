Server upgrade seemed to go well, but I was surprised to find it only
upgrade to 14.04.4 instead of 16.04.

oic:

    While an upgrade from 14.04 may successfully complete, upgrades
    between LTS releases are not enabled by default until the first
    point release, and it is recommended to wait until the 16.04.1
    point release to upgrade.
