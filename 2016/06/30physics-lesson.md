Physics Girl reminded me of the fun that can be had with magnets.

Today before my (ostensibly English) lesson with GG, I bought a meter
of thin, shielded copper wire, a couple magnets, and a little light
(emitting diode).

I brought with me a 1.5 volt AA battery and a ferrous, though
magnetically neutral <del>Allen wrench</del> <ins>hex driver</ins>
which will act as my electro magnet.

I asked M if she can bring scissors, because the wire needs to be cut
and stripped on the ends.

I hope it all works!  At the very least, we should be able to light
the light by moving the magnets down the wire.

However, I'm not sure if the battery will be strong (charged) enough
to make a fun electromagnet.
