urbit is virtual land.  I've just become the owner of a planet.  In
the universe, there are galaxies, in which there are stars, in which
there are planets in which there are moons.  There are also comets,
which don't have to be associated with anything, and will apparently
be considered bots because they cost nothing to create.

Anyway, someone in chat using the comet name
pildex-pondex-wiswyc-bosnev--botber-ronpet-tobhet-pagwyt helped the
conversation and I said (jokingly) "why should we believe you?  You're
a comet hahahaah" and as soon as I pressed enter, before the chat had
even registered as having been sent, I thought "oh god" and wanted to
take it back.

I set pildex-pondex-wiswyc-bosnev--botber-ronpet-tobhet-pagwyt's nick
to "thegreatest" but haven't seen him/her back to properly apologize.

sigh.

## update

I talked to him later and the joke was on me; he was using a moon
while his planet was in the shop.
