Haha so Lin was painting her desk today and Jennie jumped onto it!
Jennie was like, "oh sticky!!" and ran away, leaving white cat prints
on the hardwood floors.  Hilarious!

Lin cleaned the feet, the prints, and now we have fun little matte
spots on the otherwise glossy hardwood floor.

Fortunately, Lin didn't try to wash the oil based paint of the brushes
with water.  We'll just buy new brushes given we have no turpentine at
the moment.
