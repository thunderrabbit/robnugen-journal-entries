Yesterday I made a hanger for Alex, whose plastic hanger broke.  I
broke in to my old ~~macare~~ (that aint right, but that's the word
that came to mind and I had to look this one up:) *macrame* weaving
skills and went to work with 4 sets of earphones that Lin and I got
from our flights to the US in January.  Boom!  I knew they would come
in handy!
