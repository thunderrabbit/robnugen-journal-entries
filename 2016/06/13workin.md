Today I had a good lesson this morning; the students really seemed
keen, even taking pictures of the notes and recording my voice to use
for shadowing later.

Now I'm at my computer job (have been here for a bit) and just
finishing up some instructions for how to set up a web server on AWS
with DB on private subnet of VPC. Fun stuff even if I only understand
half of it!

About to go to men's group.
