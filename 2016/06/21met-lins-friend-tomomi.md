Tomomi, Lin's friend from her ex-work, is my third Tomomi to know
now, though I don't think I'll stay close in touch with her since
she's Lin's friend.

We ate yummy quinoa, salad, bread, and ice cream!  Tomomi asked me
about my barefootedness and I asked about her job and how things are
going at Lin's old job.
