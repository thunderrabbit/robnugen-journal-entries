Weird shit.  My virtualbox won't open any of the virtual boxes,
including the one I just shut down to figure out what's going on.

Now when I tried to push my journal to bitbucket I get a weird error:

    $ git push
    No user exists for uid 502
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
    
    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.
    $
