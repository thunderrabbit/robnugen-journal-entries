I was stopped by the cops in our new neighborhood, ostensibly because
I was barefoot, but possibly because I'm ostensibly not Japanese.

They asked if I had shoes (no), if I was okay (yes), where I was going
(work), what was my job (programmin'), where was my job (ebisu), where
was my crib (right over there).  I offered that I had been barefoot
for 7 years in the US and going on year 3 (or is it 4) here, and I was
on TV recently, blah blah.

A woman walking by asked them if I needed shoes; I told her no but
thank you very much.

The cops wrote down my infos and said everything was fine, but just to
be careful for glass.  Will do!

Honestly, they were both quite friendly.  One even asked to see the
bottom of my feet, and said the TV show I was on is one he often
watches.  Any ill will I'm projecting is due to mass and social media.

I still made it to my train on time.  The end.
