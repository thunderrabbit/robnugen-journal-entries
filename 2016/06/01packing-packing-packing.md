It's actually more like packing, dismantling, finding cat pee, tossing.  I've got a list on https://workflowy.com/ to help me keep my brain free.  Jennie probably knows something is up, but does she suspect her whole life will magically transform into a new wonderland of places to pee?

How much of this shit should I throw away?

Should I go through and toss everything I haven't used in a year?  Will I realllly build a new marble track with stop action animation?

I'm tossing a printer and some of the foam tiles that have carpeted the computer room.  I won't need as many to fill my room in the new house.  (;n;)

Gotta go to Fukuura to teach and then come back tonight and finish doing the day before the last day stuff.
