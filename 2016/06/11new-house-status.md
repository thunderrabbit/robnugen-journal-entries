## 21:59 Saturday 11 June 2016 JST

We moved all our stuff in on 3 June, and now it's 11 June.  Lin is
*almost* done unpacking.  I've gotten a good start unpacking.

I just affixed an extension cord+splitter to my bedside table.  I'm
waiting for Lin to finish her shower so I can fill in the price and
the shelf name.  I think it was Hermes.

We walked to a home center and bought some strong "scissors" for
cutting plants, plus a broom, which I carried in my back pocket,
sticking up out of my shirt.

We walked while workers from the auto shop put a new navigation system
into Lin's new minivan.  They said the old system was too old to be
updated with maps less than 5 years old.  Smells like forced upgrades
to me.

Though it's been 5 weeks since the show aired on 2 May, the guy
recognized me from the TV show, and we talked a bit. He apparently
used to run around barefoot as a kid.

Showertime now.
