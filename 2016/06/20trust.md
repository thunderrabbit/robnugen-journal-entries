Okay a weird thing happened the other day.  A friend of a friend
offered to let me use her crib for lessons, but she smokes so I don't
really want to use the place.  (I've been there before.)  I told my
friend my concern but asked friend not to tell her.  Friend told her
anyway and she got all pissed off and said nevermind, plus I hereby
quit (lessons, not smoking).

Dang.  I told friend not to say anything.
