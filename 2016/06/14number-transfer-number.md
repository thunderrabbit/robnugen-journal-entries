Once I decided to dump Softbank, I had to call them to get a code
to authorize the new carrier to take control of the number.

The poor kid had to read some sort of checklist, explaining the date
at which I could freely change my contract (which I already knew), the
cancellation fee which I already knew, the phone transfer fee which I
already knew, and one more thing which took me a while to understand.

    Your number is the head of the family calling plan, so please let
    me know which of the other two numbers in your family calling plan
    should be the new number.

Uh, I have no idea what you're talking about; just give me the
transfer authorization code.

After about 5 rounds of this, with me growing more and more frustrated
and wondering wtf he was on about, I kinda figured it out.  They
believe the other two numbers are in my family; that they are being
used.  One of them is Soness's number, and I've called it plenty of
times recently.  The other number, I have no fricken idea what it is,
and I'm sure I haven't called it recnently.

But between these two numbers, I am supposed to chose one to carry on
as the head of the non-existent family.

I was like, "fine the first one; whatever."

Okay, here is your transfer number 8675309 something something and I
was like, "blah thank you" and headed off (late) to my lesson with
Sarupapa.
