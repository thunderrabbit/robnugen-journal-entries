After finishing the piece (though I haven't written its title on the
back), I walked toward the station.  Got to the coast-hugging highway
and looked left: "oh hmmm wait a minute that looks like an shopping
outlet that just might have some nice bags."

So I walked over that way and saw a *trampoline* across the street
from the piace (would be great for a few free bounces, but they wanted
300 yen and I didn't have time to do 300 yen worth of flips).. so I
went to the outlet and boom, nice bags with lifetime warranty.

It's not a Briggs-Riley we'll fix it no matta what warranty, but the
bags look pretty dope, and they fit my shoes + computer + other
junk..  and Briggs-Riley ain't got outlets in Japan (that I've
found)...  hmmmm

I mighta bought the bags then + there but I didn't have enough cash on
me.  I'll do a bit more research and may go back later.
