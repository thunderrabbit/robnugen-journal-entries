Lessons at T today were good; my five students all had ample
questions, and I'm beginning to remember their names.  It's a bit hard
because the lessons are only once every 2 weeks, and they take turns
taking lessons, so I might see each of the students once a month for
45 minutes.

I explained how (at current earthly understanding of physics,) a wind
turbine must spin (same as aircraft wings): thick leading edge and
thin trailing edge.

Also talked about van de Graaff generators.  Fun times!
