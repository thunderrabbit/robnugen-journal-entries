Today after work at CB, I met Lin in Shinjuku to look at options for
mobile wifi.

Went to a shop where blue eyed Lexy explained which phones were
waterproof.  Talking to the guy upstairs, though, I couldn't
understand why he kept saying that my 3G usage wasn't a good way to
estimate my future 4G usage, so we left.

Went across the street and looked briefly at a shop advertising Tokyo
Free or something, but their prices were only for data, not voice, so
we moved to the next shop.

The next shop featured staff from Softbank who helped me determine
that my current Softbank plan isn't good for my usage.  I'm paying $70
for XYZ but using XYC so I'm paying an extra 4000 yen per month.  That
sucks.

But ya know what sucks more?  I called Softbank, and they were like,
"yeah you want to cancel?  Well, your next cancellation period starts
next year, in December (i.e. 18 months from now)."

And?

"So if ya want to cancel now, ya gotta pay 10,000 yen cancelation fee,
on top of the 3000 yen transfer-yer-phone-number fee."

Really?  I've been a customer of Softbank since back in the day.  I
got an iPhone 3 with them, and that was after my clamshell phone which
I had had since way back.

So why do they for me to pay $100 to leave?  Because they can and they
dgaf about customer loyalty or the cost of finding replacement
customers.  So, dear Softbank, I hope you enjoy the $130, and I hope
it's worth it for you to find another customer.

My iPhone 4S, *Little Blue Monkey* is headed for retirement.

I have a new waterproof Android 6 AQUOS phone. Haven't thought of a
name for it yet. Unlimited calling and 5GB internet per month for
$90. Let's see how long I like it.
