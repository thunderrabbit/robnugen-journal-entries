Sat in the park and worked on the drawing which Yoko started.

I had drawn some yellow drops around her green Vs and one of the
yellow drops was all lopsided so I was like "bluh" and stopped drawing
for a while.

Like for over a month while we were busy with moving etc, and I just
didn't do anything on those pieces started by the GG class.

On Monday night, I shared some artspiration and my student and I both
agreed to work on our art, though we had each hit a wall of sorts.  I
was like, "just make bad art" and then the good art can come later.

Well, I ended up finishing the piece!  It's a bit sparse, but I think
it's got a big presence, describing a hierarchy of fractals.
