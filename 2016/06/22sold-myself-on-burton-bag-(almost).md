So just after writing the previous entry, I thought I can gain fake
internet points by writing (and updating) a mega-detailed(?) review of
the Burton bag which caught my eye today.

I don't have pictures of the bag, but I do have questions, or one
burning question and a little question which I will compose here and
then email to burton customer service.

    Hello

    I'm interested in your Wheelie Flyer, which I found at a Burton
    outlet here in Japan.  It seems quite strong and holds all the
    things I regularly want to carry.

    I am a bit concerned about the wheels.  I walk about 4km daily on
    rough asphalt.  How will the Wheelie Flyer's IXION wheels feel
    about that? They seem easy enough to change, but I just wonder how
    long they'll last.  I know it's nearly impossible to give a
    number, but can you give me an idea of what they're designed to
    handle?  I don't usually walk through gritty sand, but sometimes
    through puddles of water, and sometimes across gravel.. and lots
    of times across rough+sharp asphalt.

    My other question involves water-proofedness.  I know the bags
    aren't rated to be waterproof, but do you have / recommend a
    waterproof cover that fits nicely on the Wheelie Flyer?

    Thanks very much for your time
       - Rob


    ps: I found this page when looking up the wheels
    https://info.burton.com/hc/en-us/articles/207928288-My-luggage-wheels-are-damaged-or-lost-Please-help-
