The September 2016 NWTA event north of Houston has a staff application
deadline in 3 days.  The one for New Zealand (a week later) has a
staff deadline in August.  Given that travel to NZ is way less
expensive, plus I have more time to waffle, I think I'll forego
staffing in Houston and apply for New Zealand.  Plus I've never been
there so it would be nice to visit!
