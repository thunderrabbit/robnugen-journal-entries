Great lesson today with GG class: we finished taking apart the 1TB
hard drive, which cost just over $200 in 2009.

(I [thoughtlessly destroyed it with magnets](/journal/2015/12/01/how-to-kill-an-external-hard-drive-for-only-a-few-dollars/); oops!)

I think I net 3000 yen per GG lesson, so I got half the hard drive
price back by taking it apart across three lessons.
