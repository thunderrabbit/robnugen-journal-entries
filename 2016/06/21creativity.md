Yesterday I taught three lessons down near Minami Machida.  The third
was with a student who creates music.  He said he likes my art, and I
talked about how it's the quantity we need to worry about instead of
the quality.

    You take care of the quantity.
    I'll take care of the quality.
    	- God

I think that's from The Artists Way.

Anyway, it's not something I've really been practicing, so I need to
get my proverbial butt in gear or something.

AND, while walking to work, all barefoot and wondering about the
mysterious future, I figure I can't keep doing compooter stuff fo-eva
(the younger generation is going to come kick my ass sooner than
later) so I need to start creating art again.  Put it on Patreon and
Canvas and blah blah blah.

SO, tomorrow while I'm waiting in the immigration office applying for
my permanent visa, I'm going to draw.
