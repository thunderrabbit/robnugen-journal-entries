My computer's kernel_task was hogging the CPU at 700% usage so I
emailed Lantz and he was able to take a look at it today.  Turns out
it was just dirty, including having something stuck in the fan keeping
it from running properly.

Well!  I can hardly blame Apple for that, but I'm glad I was able to
get it fixed (plus receive a five point driver that can drive the
Pentalobe screws) without paying them.

So, now that my machine is working again, I will be able to be
productive tomorrow / tonight / right now.  Lantz suggested I give the
machine a good cleaning about once a year; hopefully this machine will
keep working for a long time.  We'll see!

Further prep included going to a sewing shop to get some thick thread
and needles to fix my bag.  I'm bummed that my attempt to buy a Burton
bag resulted in Goldilock's Syndrome, but I'm not going to buy a new
bag that's not optimal for my needs.
