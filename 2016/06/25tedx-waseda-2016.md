So today was the big day! Got to assist Soness at TEDx Waseda as she
assisted all the speakers in the event. I helped Alan by recording
some audience reactions during the presentations.  I couldn't do many
because the camera couldn't discern much of the audience in the dark.
He recorded all the presenters and some audience reactions after the
show.

All the presentations were great!  Well, the ones in Japanese were
hard (near impossible) for me to understand, but the rest were great!
Yuji's was amazing for his first time up on stage.  I'd love to give a
presentation that well!

Great to meet Rick (who flew in from LA to speak) and Mitsue, both of
whom I knew from Soness's
[TED Worth Application](https://soness.teachable.com/courses/ted-worthy-application/)
course.

Great to see すん, and got to meet his friend はるき as well!  They
both came up from Yokohama, having been invited by Soness.  They're
taking her class on communication skills.  Met
[Steve Marshall](https://www.youtube.com/user/bannerline) after the
show and told him about Tokyo men's group.

Outside, Steve and Mitsue took pictures of Yuji, me, and my bare feet
for Pecha Kucha, and I got caught by the "one" security guard roaming
the campus on Saturday when I climbed up on a wall overlooking a
staircase.  Aww man it wasn't event at the deep part of the stairs!

We took a bus then subway to Shibuya (we = me, Soness, Yuji, Mitsue,
and Rick) where we ate 回転寿司 (かいてんすし) after visiting
Hachiko.  I chatted with Mitsue during dinner, talking about how I met
Lin and how she met her husband, and the history of flower arrangement
in Japan.  Turns out she is 9 (nine) days older than me.  Wow!!!

She also teaches English in Japan, so I invited her to the TESOL thing
tomorrow; we'll see if she comes!

Okay I just got to my station. bye!
