## 11:03 Monday 27 June 2016 JST

I walked for 1.5 hours today, 25 minutes to the station, and then a
lot of walking to look for the TUMI shop and then walked to work...
almost walked to work; Lin called me back and offered to meet me at
our station to hand off a folder I forgot to bring with me today (not
critical, but for men's group meeting tonight, so I'd prefer to have
it).

So I walked to Ebisu and took the Saiyo Line to Shinjuku,

## 11:30

whereupon I found the Odakyu Line was completely stopped due to a
suicide.

Thanks guy!  You saved me some time!

Headed back to work where I've just arrived at 11:49.

I'm tired now.  Want to sleep super much but other people are here bah.
