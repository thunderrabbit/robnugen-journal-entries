You've probably hear of blood blisters.  I have one on my thumb, a
result of clipping some thick twigs with scissor-sized loppers a
couple weeks ago.  The skin of my thumb got caught between the handles
as they thunked together and boom instant blood blister.  Yay!

A couple days earlier I had done the same thing to my index finger.
Scissor-sized loppers and oops blood blister on my finger!

Except there's a difference.  Two weeks later, the one on my finger
still hurts.  The one on my thumb stopped hurting at least a week ago,
and is just waiting for the skin to slough off.

The finger one has a slight lump under the skin and still hurts a
little if I press on it.  I'm calling it a nerve blister!

Just for fun, I'm at the clinic near our new house; I have some time
available as my afternoon meeting was canceled and the clinic is right
along the path between the station and our house.

I super doubt the doctor will suggest anything besides pain meds,
which I will politely refuse... but I just wonder if there's anything
to do with it besides wait.  I wish I could talk to Dr Cutie!!

The recommended I go to a skin clinic, and gave me a map to the clinic.  Synchronistic: I had *just* walked "randomly" down near the skin clinic, so I knew exactly where it was and how to get there.
