Just taught three lessons at T near Lazona.  I really enjoy these
lessons because the students always have questions / topics /
something to practice.  The first two lessons were 30 minutes each.
The first student talked about a wooden doll which carries tea cups.
The next student talked about a record player.  The third lesson was
scheduled to be an hour, but there was a bit of miscommunication and
we ended up starting 15 minutes late.

Actually, this student was the best of the three today, probably
because she used to live in the US.  It was our first time to meet.
She has the same first name as my old student who makes bears and
loves roller coasters.
