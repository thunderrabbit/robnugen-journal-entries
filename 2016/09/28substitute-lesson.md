I subbed for Matt again this week.  Each class had one more student
than last week, so I guess that was a good sign.  I talked about neti
with one of the students who was suffering from allergies.

We imagined luxurious vacations in both classes. "They will fly to
Italy to eat pizza" and "they would fly in a hot air balloon" are
examples of the grammar structures used in each class.
