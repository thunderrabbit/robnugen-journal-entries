I upgraded the wiki on thunderrabbit.com the other day.  Now it's time
to upgrade the one on wiki.robnugen.com

1. ~~Rotate ssh key for login~~
2. ~~Add the login infos to local ~/.ssh/config~~
3. ~~Effectively disable remote password by setting it to 200+ random
characters~~
4. ~~Backup data~~
5. ~~Update wiki~~
6. Yay!

Yay, but my extension needed a re-tweak.  Plus I need to edit all the
&gt;permalink> tags to be &gt;permalink/> closed.  boooo


I'm actually considering splitting it into two wikis. But how smart is
that?  I'd have to maintain a third Mediawiki installation.
Nevermind.  No splitting for now.
