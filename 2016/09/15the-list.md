[The List](https://www.amazon.com/List-Zombie-Ocean-Book-ebook/dp/B01L2VFYQK) by Michael John Grist is now available!  This is the fifth
book in his Zombie series starting with The Last, and it's possibly
The Best!

This book really drives the characters forward, facing their greatest
fears head-on as they leaving loved ones behind, stepping into a fight
for their survival.

I love the care Grist puts into little details, bringing the
characters to life in the real world, with great subtle foreshadowing!
I notice more little details on my second reading.

As applies to all Grist's novels, the characters are relatable, lovable,
and mortal!  I really want to shout at them to do the right thing or
in some cases not do the wrong thing!

One or two scenes had me woozy with the gore.  Real blood and real
face-to-face fights for life.

And then there's the character arcs, and the plot surprises!  I bet
you didn't see _(spoiler redacted)_ coming!  Or what about _(spoiler
redacted)_? Can you believe it?

This book will stand on its own, but you really should pick up the
whole series; more books are coming and I can hardly wait!
