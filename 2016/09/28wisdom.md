I told Travis about my idea to walk to Niigata.  Here I'll just post
the email:

His reply:

    Sounds like quite a plan!  What is the furthest/longest you have walked
    (barefoot) so far?  Perhaps it would be wise, for health reasons, to try
    a shorter (25%?) trip before committing to such a long one.

What?  Plan ahead??

Well, since I'm just futzing around before class, which is 1/2 the
length of Seaside Line away from here, perhaps I can walk to class
now.  I know it's not 1/4 of the way to Niigata, but it's more than
1/100th!

From here to Niigata is 74 hours on foot.  From here to work is 1.25
hours on foot.

Aw man, it's raining!

(And I have no rain cover for my backpack, the only part of me that's
not waterproof.)
