## 05:18 Tuesday 27 September 2016 JST

I woke up without an alarm this morning because I took a big nap
yesterday, knowing that I have to wake up earlier than normal to teach
a lesson for Matt who is at home in UK at the moment.  Train is at
6:29, so I plan to leave the house at 6am.

Better get my butt off my computer and go!  Lemme just check hacker
news and reddit real quick...
