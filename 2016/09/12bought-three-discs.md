Played ultimate with an Aerobee yesterday with Suns Out Guns Out.  It
was challenging to control, but fun even so.  Even so, I bought three
ultimate discs from Club Jr.  I'll bring them out one at a time until
they're too old to use.

Two weeks ago, my Y2K compliant disc cracked.  Boo.  It didn't get
used all its life, but it had a long life: 16+ years.  After cracking,
we kept using it to practice, and it cut someone's thumb upon them
catching it.  Oops.  To keep that from happening again, I converted
the crack into a split all the way to the other rim, though I wasn't
able to break the other rim.
