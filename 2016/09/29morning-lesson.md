## 07:48 Thursday 29 September 2016 JST

Just met Tim at the clock in Kawasaki so he can cover for Matt here in
what I call the Zavas building.

As predicted, our students are not yet here, but they still have 1
second by my.. nevermind, now they're late.

Lesson was good; we somehow got onto the subject of web security; I
encouraged them to use a password manager like
[Lastpass](https://lastpass.com/) or [1Password](https://1password.com/)
