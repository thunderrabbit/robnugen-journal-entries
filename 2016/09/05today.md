Great lesson this morning; we estimated the viability of a product
based on its description.  This process provided a review of vocab
from last time so I think it was really useful.

Worked at work and updated Ghost Inspector tests to deal with new
version of Datatables.  Moving to version 1.10 of datatables I needed
to change Ghost Inspector to find the search field as type="search"
instead of type="text". I guess type="search" is an HTML5 thing.

Great I-group tonight; I led an exercise that encouraged some "deeper
sharing" as we would say in YRUU parlance.  Good stuff, and I got some
stuff out and good insights in return.

Watched construction in Shibuya for several minutes after the
meeting.  They had some large containers full of soil which they moved
with a giant crane so a little backhoe could scoop the soil out of the
containers and put it in dump trucks.  It required about 20 scoops to
fill the dump truck, and at least two dump trucks to hold everything
in the container.  Why not just put the container on the back of a
bigger truck?

Right now I'm in Shinjuku on Odakyu Line, and train is about to leave
(21:47pm, according to my computer)

I'm planning to buy some [Monero](https://getmonero.org/), now that
it's gotten a bit popular and just came across my radar.
