Just had online I-group; I've been on the weekly call for about a year
now.  Awesome connection.

Well, these days my e-physical connection isn't so great; I call in
from Wired Cafe because the call starts 30 minutes after my English
class ends and I'm too far away (at currently available technology)
from my house to do the call from there.
