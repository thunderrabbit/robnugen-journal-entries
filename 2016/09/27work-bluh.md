Bluh computer work kinda sucked today; I spent 5 hours on one thing
and 3.5 hours on a different thing and made almost 0 progress on
them.  The second thing was futzing around with .htaccess file, and
for 2.5 of the 3.5 hours it actually wasn't being read. *facepalm* I
needed to AllowOverride All in the Apache2 directives...  but do I
want to do that on live server?  I wonder if it's already on our live
server?  Anyway, once I got Apache to actually look at the file, I
made an inch of progress, but nothing like what I had hoped.  Blarg.
