Back before the World Wide Web popularized The Internet, we had
BBS on Fidonet.  The best BBS in my world was The Castle of Dreams.

Some years ago, I made an homage to Castle of Dreams on
thunderrabbit.com.  That's because I created the character Thunder
Rabbit specifically to participate on The Castle of Dreams.

Featuring https, the latest version of Mediawiki, and an
["amazing" array of navigation routes](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/NavigationForPagesAsRooms/blob/master/NavigationForPagesAsRooms.php),
[The Castle of Dreams](https://thunderrabbit.com/castle/The_Castle_Entrance)
is ready for exploration!

Sweet.  Now if we visit via http it will refresh to https.  And I
added a link from https://thunderrabbit.com/ top page to the Dragon
run-way of the wiki.  Get it?  Run way?  Where dragons run?  If I did
it again now I might make it "Dragon run way" without a hyphen, but
I'm not going to change it right now.  I gotta run to next lesson.
