I taught a lesson this morning for Matt in Marunochi.  Three students,
relatively high level.

Here's my report on the lesson:

<pre>
Topics included introductions (given that it was our first lesson
together), differences in culture between the US and Japan, and (after
the women left at 8:55 for an accounting class,) finance.

The students did not have any books nor topics, so it might be
valuable to have something available to give a bit of direction to the
class.

New vocab included
Inclusive, exclusive, trunk, branch

Seems like a pretty great class; I'd be happy to sub there again.
