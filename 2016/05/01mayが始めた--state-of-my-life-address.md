1. I've not been journaling regulary.
2. I've been studying Japanese
3. I've been studying TESOL
4. I've been studying presentation skills
5. I've got a long way to go in all three
6. I had been studying AWS as in Amazon Web Services, but I've let that slide recently as no hard deadline
7. I'm teach lessons to SS and fairly enjoying it, though it takes a lot of prep time to do it well
8. I'm curious about chatbots, robots, arduino, drones, ... any of which could suck up all time and resources
9. Lin and I are moving soon!  This is almost certainly the last SOML that I'll write from 川崎区浜町.
10. We're moving to 麻生区東百合ヶ丘

## annnnd now it's Thursday 5 May

Wow cinco de mayo!

Today is the third holiday in a row of Golden Week; during which I
have not needed to go to work.  I'm just going to ignore the little
detail that I went to an empty classroom on Tuesday; derp.

Today I discovered freeCodeCamp, and have just finished exercise 253.  (most of the first ones were sooper easy.)

I used
[.reduce() to find the longest word in a sentence](https://goo.gl/k7Q7UQ)

We had 3 men in I-group this past Monday, and 3 men absent... so 6 all
together!  That's great; we're up 100% since August.  Yay!

And now I just used
[.map() and .reduce() to do this](https://goo.gl/fq4rEU).  Thank you
Travis, for having explained how they work that time while we were
walking to the restaurant you liked.
