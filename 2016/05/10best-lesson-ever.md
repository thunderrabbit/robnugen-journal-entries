Wow I just had the best lesson ever with SS.

I reviewed "it's a thing that ______" and then got a fake phone call
on a hollow tube.

    "Hello?"
    
    "Oh hey what's up?"
    
    "Yeah sorry I'm ______-ing right now"
    
    "Okay bye"

I then gave out a paper with 11 action images on it, including 4
screenshots of SS members performing.

I went through the vocab.

1. What are you doing?  I'm walking.
2. What are you doing?  I'm reading.
3. etc etc
3. etc etc
3. etc etc
3. etc etc
3. etc etc
3. etc etc
3. etc etc
3. etc etc
3. etc etc
12. What are you doing?  I'm studying.

Then got another fake phone call, and went through the language again.

"Hello?"

"Oh hey what's up?"

"Yeah sorry I'm ______-ing right now"

"Okay just a moment....   it's for you."

And gave the phone to first student.

Then we did the full conversation.  Students rolled dice to determine
what they were busy doing.

    "Hello?"
    "HI This is Rob!"
    "Oh hey what's up?"
    "Are you buys?"
    "Yeah sorry I'm ______-ing right now"
    "Oh. okay.  May I speak to ______?"
    "Okay just a moment....   it's for you."

I went through each student so they could practice saying they were
busy.

Okay, what month is it?

May!!

Let's play Mother May I!

Taking "May I speak to ____" apart, we have "May I ______," so we practiced
"May I" with 3 increasingly complex versions of Mother May I.


version 1:

    Dice roll
    Mother May I take __ steps?
    Yes you may.   /   No you may not.

version 2:

    Dice roll
    Mother May I take __ (huge|big|small|tiny) steps?
    Yes you may.   /   No you may not.   You may take ____
         (huge|big|small|tiny) steps (backwards).

version 3:

    Dice roll
    Mother May I (jump|hop|take) __ (huge|big|small|tiny) (times|steps)?
    Yes you may.   /   No you may not.   You may (jump|take|hop) ____
         (huge|big|small|tiny) (times|steps) (backwards).

Then we still had 30 more minutes and I had run out of material, so I
designed a game to put everything together.

    Hello?
    HI This is _______.
    Oh HI What's up?
    Are you busy?
    
    (dice roll)
    
    Yes.  I'm _____-ing now.
    Oh, okay.  May I speak to ______?
    Yes, just a moment.
    
    No. How may I help you?
    Take 3 steps.

We played that version a couple times as I slowly erased the
whiteboard and we had two callers asking for various people after the
callees said they were busy with various things.
