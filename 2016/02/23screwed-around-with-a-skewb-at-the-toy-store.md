Labeled both as "Skewb" and "Meffert's Challenge" the toy flummoxed my
ability to solve more than 2 (adjacent) faces correctly.  It only has
two slices(?) per face (whereas the Rubik's Cube has four by my
counting), but because they're at screwy angles, I haven't yet been
able to wrap my little brain around how to do it.

The price went up while I was standing there playing with the sample
model (from 2200 to 2600 yen) so if I buy it, I'll probably look
online instead of that toy store.  What does that imply?  That I'd
rather save a buck than give monies to the store where I'm friendly
with the staff?  Weird.
