    Gary!
    
    We were just approved for a house loan to buy our first house!
    It's 20km from the coast (20 x further than now, so safer from
    tsunamis), larger than our current rental house, and half the
    monthly cost!  yay!  It's all electric, so when free energy
    technology is released, we'll be ready!
    
    My train commutes will be longer, so I plan to spend more time
    drawing my art https://art.robnugen.com/art
    
    My brother Fred, my wife Lin, and I went skydiving near San Marcos
    while we were visiting this past January.
    
    I'm active in my men's group (https://www.mkp.org/) in Tokyo, and
    helping it to grow to support more men, including Japanese!
    
    And we have a cat named Jennie!

     See you
      - Rob!
