yesterday Lin and I applied for a bank loan to buy our new house!  The
negative interest rates hadn't trickled down yet apparently, but we'll
see what kinda rate we are offered.  I think I heard the real estate
guy say 0.77% which I guess is reasonable.

After applying, we went through the house and too measurements of
every room.

Afterward, I headed to work from new station (we're 22 minutes' walk
from 新百合ケ丘)..  83 minutes on three train lines to work.  yay!???
I've determined to use this time to draw pictures.
