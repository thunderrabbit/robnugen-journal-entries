Watched _The Peanuts Movie_; it was cute and great!  I liked how they
brought in all the old stories and combined them nicely into a nice
believable story.

Watching 007 _Spectre_ now; slightly less believable.  ;-)

_Spectre_ was pretty okay, though the video started to skip near the end
so I turned it off and turned on _The Martian_, which I really
enjoyed, partially because it stars Matt Damon.

Just under 2 hours to Narita.
