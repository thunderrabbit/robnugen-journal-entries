Okay so I'm trying to post a sad+funny thing about IBM customer
service.  I took a screenshot of the email they sent and opened my
screenshot directory in Finder.

or *tried* to open the directory in Finder, but it just showed the
loading gif and didn't load the directory contents.

So I force-quit Finder and it quit, but now will not reload.

* CPU is at 7% usage.
* Hard drive has 13 Gigs available.
* uptime is 17 days

    $ uptime
    9:53  up 17 days, 15:20, 3 users, load averages: 2.31 2.37 2.31

Everything seems to be responding fine except Finder.

sigh

rebooting my machine now.
