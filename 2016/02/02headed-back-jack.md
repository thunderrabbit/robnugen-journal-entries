We perfectly made our connection in DFW, but I was a little bit sad we
didn't see Mom, who said she may be able to meet us in the airport.

It's about 1am in Tokyo now, so I'm going to go to sleeeeeeppppppppp.

Good morning!!!  I woke up a couple of times during my anti-jetlag
sleep to drink and eat, but slept pretty well overall for the past 7
hours, and now I'm awake for Wednesday in Tokyo.

Right now I plan to draw some drawings, which I have not yet done at
all during our trip.
