A few days ago I was excited to see IBM encouraging blockchain
technology.  It's new uncharted territory in my mind so I thought hey
cool some big players are encouraging it.

I tried to sign up for their service and was spooked by their password
restrictions.  Only 31 characters, and no 'special' characters.

So I wrote them a little email:

    only 31 character passwords?

    Why can't I use %^#$%#% as my password?   Or better yet 100 randomized characters?  Why only 31 characters?
    
    I was attracted to Blockchain as a Service, but am running scared from your password limitations.

    But good luck with it; thank you for posting the code as well.
