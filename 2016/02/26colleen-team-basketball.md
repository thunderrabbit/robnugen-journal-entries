Colleen and another tall girl were playing basketball against two
young kids, easily beating them so I joined the little kids' team to
help even the game.  Colleen jumped onto my back to slow me down, but
I still while lying down on the sidelines, trying to throw the ball to
the smaller kids. Eventually I was able to get up and do slam dunks
with Colleen piggybacking me; I was pretty impressed, but I figured my
body had just gotten used to having my heavy backpack all the time and
Colleen was no heavier.
