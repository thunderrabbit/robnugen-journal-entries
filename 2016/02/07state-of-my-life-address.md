1. I gave Lin her first 1 hour massage from me.  She's due for 15 this
   year, according to the massage coupon I gave her.  She thinks I
   should start doing massages for real, and I enjoyed it enough to
   consider the same thing.
2. We applied to buy our new house in 新百合ケ丘!
3. I'm enjoying doing lessons on http://acloud.guru/
4. I still have my black iPhone 4S, though I will "soon" "upgrade" to
   Lin's 5S.
5. I added a pic of me, fred, lin at the skydiving place onto the wall
   in my main room of the minecraft server I've been making for Fred.
6. I installed [Mountain Duck](https://mountainduck.io/) which makes
   it easy to copy images to my server, but hard to get image URLs
   for those images on my server.
7. I've applied to be a (foot) model on streamen (NSFW), but not yet been approved.
8. I plan to draw for 1 hour 3 days per week, do MOOV exercises 3 days
   per week... hmm this is still phrased in terms that require __will
   power__, so maybe I should tweak it a bit.
