After receiving an email from Emily
to see if I was interested in moving ahead with my
Soomla account, I wrote to her:

    HI Emily!
    
    I just looked at your top page (soom.la) and see a weird image
    near the bottom with significant typo and something that makes no
    sense to me
    
![Welcome Abroad](https://netlify.scdn4.secure.raxcdn.com/52f05a92bec4f022a3483fcafe62636f5ba91855/68e2a/images/action-picture.jpg)
    
    both 'Welcome Abroad' and 'generous today"generous today' seen[sic]
    strange enough that it reduces the perceived quality of your site
    and therefore product.
     
    Anyway, that's just some feedback if you like.

She replied back to thank me and said she'd have it fixed right
away.. I thought we'll see, but a couple days later, it's essentially
fixed!
