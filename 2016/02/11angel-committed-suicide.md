Fucking hell.

Angel, who I knew originally as Red Fern back on the
Castle of Dreams (on Fidonet) has apparently committed suicide.
Someone on her page wrote something like "I cannot forgive you for
this; you had so many people to turn to...."

I have similar sentiments; I know she had some medical debt, and some
medical issues, but dang..  could that have warranted a bullet to the
head?
