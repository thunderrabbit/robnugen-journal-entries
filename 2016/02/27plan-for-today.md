## written Monday, in an email to Mayumi

    Thank you for the lesson notes!
    
    Here is a link to the episode where I was originally interviewed
    (you saw this on TV already)
    
    https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3tm778_160222-y
    
    Starting about 2 minutes into the video, you can see me act
    unnatural on camera!!  ;-)
    
    Saturday was fantastic!  I met them at the clock in Kawasaki
    station, but they are not allowed to film on JR property, so we
    went outside to film the greeting.
    
    We walked to my house (30 minutes) and I showed them in detail
    some of the different sidewalk / street surfaces, from red brick
    cobblestone to decorative tiles, to asphalt of varying grades.
    
    We bought bananas at my favorite local mom and pop fruit stand "は
    しもと" (they use hiragana, not kanji on their sign) where the
    wife spoke a bit about me.  It was funny that at the end she said
    分からない、ね?  referring to me, though I had understood more
    than she might think.
    
    They watched me wash my feet at home (my ritual when I get back to
    the house) and then I showed them my art and a couple of things
    including where I do programming work (so you'll probably get to
    see my messy desk!)
    
    We went out to the park across the street where there were two
    young girls on the swings.  They were like, "are we on TV??" and
    hid their faces at first.  The crew filmed me climbing on the
    playground equipment, and after the kids warmed up to us, we got
    to play follow the leader, tag, and "vending machine", which was a
    new game for me!  I'll explain it in our lesson because I think it
    will be too confusing to explain in text.
    
    After a couple hours (?) in the park, we went inside to do foot
    washing again, then took a break for lunch and for me to get ready
    for Jack and Betty lesson!  I dressed up in suit, tie and barefoot
    to walk to the lesson, and then put on shoes just before going
    inside.  I wouldn't normally do that in a suit, but the director
    requested it because it looked more interesting!
    
    They interviewed Kayoko a bit before the lesson, and then filmed
    me actually teaching the lesson..  (I think it went okay!)  We
    ended up focusing on a couple of vocabulary words "eye opening"
    and something else, and the -ing vs -ed ending of words which we
    just did in Akihabara!
    
    After the simultaneous filming, teaching, and delicious lunch, we
    went back outside and I took my shoes off.  Then we re-filmed the
    arrival at Jack and Betty School.  (more lies for the camera!!)  I
    just showed + introduced the school at the sign, walked up the
    stairs and put my shoes on before the lesson. We did not go back
    inside again.
    
    Walked back to my house, got quickly dressed for the beach, then
    took the bus down to Kawasaki and Tokaido line to Chigasaki!  I
    drew some of my art on the train and we did a quick interview
    outside Chigasaki station before walking to the beach!
    
    My dear friend Soness met us there; she brought her hula hoop and
    some rice-cooker-made banana chocolate cake!  She showed me how to
    hula hoop, and surprisingly enough, I was able to do it for more
    than 1 second!  We sang the refrain from Ashkon's song Round Like
    a Hula Hoop.
    
    Lots of rock hopping, interviews about men's group work, and fun
    fun fun before taxi back to Chigasaki station and Shonan-Shinjuku
    Line to The Pink Cow in Roppongi!  Lin and some of our dear
    friends were there (camera crew and I arrived late) and we had
    yummy burritos and a very quick interview on camera about the
    wonderful Pink Cow!
    
    We chat chat chatted for a couple hours before Lin drove me and
    camera crew to our house for the "introduce my wife" interview,
    where we pretended it was 9:45am and they had just arrived at my
    house for the first time!  Lin's mom was asleep, so we had to
    modify another little interview where they asked if I have any
    shoes at all.  I got them from my room as if they aren't always in
    the 玄関!  (more and more lies for the camera!)
    
    Then we said HI to our cat Jennie (not on camera), had some tea and bade them farewell after a long day of filming!
    
    I'm happy to answer any questions on Thursday!
    
    - Rob!
