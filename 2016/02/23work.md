I got three tickets done at work today.  For a moment, I had a sense
that I should work more diligently.  The feeling passed quickly
enough, but it was interesting.

I got approval to have the camera guys film at the office, but then
the director of the camera guys said he would just film me as a
programmer at home.  Oh well.
