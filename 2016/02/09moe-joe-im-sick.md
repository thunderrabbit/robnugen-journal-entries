Bluh I'm sick today, and took the day off from CB and Saru work.

Went to a local clinic and got some meds; was feeling better during
the day after sleeping, and then started "working" on AB site.

Streamed my socked feet online, but no one joined the fun.

Kinda got back into the Ghost Inspector AB groove, but not totally
sure why some tests are not passing while others are.
