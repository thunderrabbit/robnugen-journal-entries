Today at 9:30, I'm substitute teaching <del>6</del> <ins>9</ins>
students who are apparently up-n-coming stars or at least wannabe
stars.  There's a non zero chance I might teach them again; we shall
see!

I just need to stay awake until then!  (I'm in a nearby convenience store.)

The class was fun!  Their band is
[Silent Siren](http://silent-siren.com/en/); we did an
adjective-opposites game and then practiced English phrases they can
use on stage.

Afterward, I received two chocolate valentines, including a homemade
cookie!
