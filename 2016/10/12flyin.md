We took off ten minutes early, and I've just had a nice nap.  Got
several neat pictures on the way up, but I wonder if I'll ever post them.

Gonna work on date difference calculator.

in-flight breakfast!

ps: I'm nearly done with proof of concept of my days old counter, but
I have just discovered the
[dateDiff](https://github.com/xrexonx/dateDiff) library I snagged
doesn't allow dates from the 1800s.  Do I care?  Hmmmm.
