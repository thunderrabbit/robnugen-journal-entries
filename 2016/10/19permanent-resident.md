I now have permanent residency status in Japan.

I don't really know how I feel about it.  Good?  Traitor?

After cutting my toe on the way to work, I put some tissues on it and
it stopped bleeding without having to tell anyone at work. Yay. I
don't want to be pressured into wearing shoes just because of a little
blood.

On the way home I asked Cine where she had been and she said a family
member passed just 7 hours ago.  I'm about to call her after I get off
the train.

Here are the gory details I wrote to Fred:

* 1:19pm: leave house 11 minutes early
* 1:27pm: arrive at bus stop 15 minutes early
