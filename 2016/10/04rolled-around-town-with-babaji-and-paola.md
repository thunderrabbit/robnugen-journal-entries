I showed up at Paola's with a gift of playing Jenga.  Gift not
delivered, but instead we went on an adventure via taxi to カンノンジ
(I have no idea about the kanji now) where a room is open to allow
viewing of a statue for a deity whose name I've forgotten.

Thanks to S for letting me shift our meeting time to 1pm from noon.
