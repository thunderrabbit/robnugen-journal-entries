1. Okay, so we're going to do some Head Heart ans Soul workshops in
Tokyo.  John said he'll send me the protocol, and I'll show it to
Rohini; I think (hope!) she'll be really into the idea.  We'll run a
few of those, and then I'll contact Ken who said he'll come out for a
PIT if we have 20 participants.

2. Shadow Work workshops that John and Rhonda lead may also be good.
