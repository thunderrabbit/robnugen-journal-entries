    Might Termux work for you?

Thanks for the suggestion!  It's quite great!

In fact, it does everything I thought I would need...  BUT, it doesn't
let me see the images so I can rename them before moving them to the
server.

It solves a big problem though, because for some reason, OS X won't
notice my phone when I plug it in to my machine.  (Thanks Apple!)

So at least I can use termux to just bulk upload all my images from my
phone to a server, pull them down to my machine, rename and put them
in subdirs based on their content, and re-upload!  Yayaayyyyy that
.. well, that leaves a lot of room for improvement!  ;-)

I'm still doing iOS development which keeps me tied to this hardware,
at least for that purpose.  But this machine has gone out of style
even by Apple standards, so maybe it's time to upgrade to
.... something fancy!

I visited this question about a year ago (more?)..  Maybe I'll start
looking again.
