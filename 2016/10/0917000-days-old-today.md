Today is my 17000th day!

[SOGO](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sogotko)has been [moved to 2pm](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SOGOTKO/permalink/1102787046441917/) because it's raining hard enough to be
considered rain in my book!

Tonight after the workout I'm going to join Lin at her sisters for
food and karaoke, which luckily landed on my 17000th day!
