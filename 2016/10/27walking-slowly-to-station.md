My slow walk to station time takes 25 minutes

Sub times:

* 3:00 from house to first light
* 4:00 from light to top of valley
* 5:00 from top of valley to next light
* 4:00 from light after valley
* 3:30 valley light to vending and pokestop
* 2:00 from last traffic light to last light
* 3:30 from last light to platform

Given these intervals, if I'm late leaving for the station, I only
need to catch up to one of these points and I know I can walk slowly again.
