I'm in Akihabara for my Thursday evening lesson, but some people are
still in a meeting in the room where the lesson is usually held.  One
of the other students is here, so I imagine we will get to kick them
out soon.

Because of my sweet drink, she asked if I like sweets / sweet drinks.

I started to explain the difference between the sweet adjective and
sweets as nouns.  She asked if it was the same as "suite room."  Nope;
suite is a noun.
