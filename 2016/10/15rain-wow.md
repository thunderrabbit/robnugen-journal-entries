Super interesting rain here.  It's "partly cloudy" but with each cloud
there's like a decent rain shower.  Then clear for 20 minutes and then
rain like boom and then clear and then rain.  It's been happening
basically all day.  We never got storms like that in Houston, where
it's like boooooom rain and then clear for the rest of the week or
month.
