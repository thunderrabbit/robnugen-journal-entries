Lin is driving me to Narita airport because my check-in time is 7:25
tomorrow, and there are no trains that leave early enough to make it
on time (if I leave from our house tomorrow).

We're going to stay in a hotel <del>(rar)</del> and after she drops me off at the
airport tomorrow, she plans to go back to the hotel to enjoy their
onsen, buffet breakfast, etc, before checking out.

Safely at the hotel and time to give Lin a massage.

Done.  Now working on days old page of website.

Actually about to take a shower; I'm past the too tired to program
well stage.

Actually I'm at the "should I take a shower" stage.
