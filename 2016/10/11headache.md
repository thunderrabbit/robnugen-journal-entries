I have a headache, which I think is due to too much computering.

How interesting that today's lesson topic was compulsory vacation

Headache is better after going home for a nice nap and a little pink
tablet Lin gave me in case of headache.  Also just walked to Olympic
to buy two liters of orange juice.
