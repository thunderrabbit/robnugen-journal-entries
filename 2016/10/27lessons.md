Lesson with A this morning was good; one-to-one because C is out of
town.  Not sure about K.

Lessons with guides today were fine.  Six back-to-back lessons in 3
hours about fun sciency topics.

Lesson with GG was great; we played an "a / the" game using coins.  Y
got a bit confused and I was suprised about that.  I think it might
have been because M seems to have fibbed, but I let it go.  If I'm
correct about what happened, the core problem is that the lesson
content was too difficult.  Bad teacher.
