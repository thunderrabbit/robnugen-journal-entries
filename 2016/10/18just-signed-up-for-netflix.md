The TV mysteriously broke while I was in OZ and Lin got a new one that
supports Netflix, not just Hulu which we've liked for a long while,
(and others we never used).

Netflix is hella better than Hulu.

1. can pause movies for a while without the stream being disconnected
8. can fast forward and reverse with great control
2. can see thumbnails larger than a postage stamp
3. can see titles and descriptions in English
4. can rate movies
5. can get movie recommendations per different profile
6. seems like a lot more variety of things to watch
7. 5% less expensive

Just turned on *Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels*, and realize I've
never seen it before!
