Great lesson this morning.  M and N each gave presentations on the
voting age in Japan.  We cleaned up the presentations and they got
progressively more coherent, though still not perfect.  This is the
second week for us on the topic, so next week will be a new topic:
compulsory vacation days in Japan.
