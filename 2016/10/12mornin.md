Breakfast was lots of veggies for me and a larger variety for Lin.
The restaurant had a Pepper robot in front, but it wouldn't follow me
when I beckoned it.  It faced me, but didn't come with me.

Gotta pack and bounce outta here.

I'm the first person in the departure lounge!

The bus was pretty much full: full sized, and full of people.  Plus
there was another bus which left at the same time.  Plenty of
travelers woke up early in that hotel.
