(names changed)

Hanako and Christy are over from Austin at Hanako's parents, who happen
to be our neighbors across the street.  Mom came over at 9pm or so and
was like, "Rob!  come over!"

After hugging Hanako and Christy I talked to them and ignored Hanako's
siblings who were there with family because I was in
new-people-overload (doesn't take much, I guess) and selfishly wanted
to talk to Americans.

Hanako has been in the US for a while.  We talked about their jobs,
which kinda overlap with Freds, though I couldn't get him on the
phone.

They went to fish market today and are going to Kyoto tomorrow.  I
might not see them again fo-eva because I'll be in Perth soon, and I
think they'll be gone before I get back, but it was great to talk a
bit!

Mom made great food, of which I had a little at their house, and Lin
and I nearly finished it at home (Lin arrived at 10:30pm from work)
