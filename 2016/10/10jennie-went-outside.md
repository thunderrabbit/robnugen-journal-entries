Oops Jennie went outside.  We've been trying to keep her in at night
because Lin is worried Jennie will come back with an injury.  I think
it was a fluke, but even so I'm open to keeping Jennie closed inside
at night. Except when I leave the window open above my desk.  Jennie
jumped up on my shelf.   ... and she's gone.
