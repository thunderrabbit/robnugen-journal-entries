Maybe I should make this a state of my life address; I'm sure it's
been over a month since the last one

1. I've staffed twice in Perth (Oct 2015 and Oct 2016), and three
   times total for MKP NWTAs.
2. I recently got my permanent residency visa so I can leave Japan and
come back without much consideration
3. I'm working on an app for iOS in Swift, based on
   [breakout game](https://www.raywenderlich.com/129904/create-breakout-game-sprite-kit-swift-part-2)
4. I'm working on an app for Android in Java, based on a Hello World,
   with the hopes that I can get `scp` working with ssh keys to send
   images to my website
5. I haven't taken any Japanese lessons for a while due to lack of
   funding, but I just recently reconnected to my US bank so I can
   send money over.
6. Last night I waited at the door for an hour, excited for my
   [Magination](https://www.maginationgame.com) set to arrive, but it
   was a different piece of mail.
7. Lin has been working crazy long hours, but she may change that
soon.
8. We have one cat (Jennie), who is about 5 years old (I think Lin
said)
9. I've been studying kanji with JA Sensei on Android
10. My phone is a waterproof Android AQUOS by Sharp.  I still have my
iPhone 4 to use iMessage at times, but that's being phased out
11. After my lesson today I plan to exchange business cards with the
    Japanese teacher who teaches in the next room during the same
    timeslot.  She wants to do language exchange.  If we do that, I
    want to be extremely clear about who's teaching whom at a given
    moment.  (Why do I care so much?)
12. My room is still a mess since we moved in in June.  It makes Lin
crazy, but it makes me crazy to throw stuff away.
13. I haven't touched my art in months.  Part of me wants to toss
    it... maybe I should keep drawing and pass them out as free
    advertising.  No idea what's "best"
14. Lin and I are considering going to Niigata for New Year's holiday,
    leaving and arriving exactly on the busiest days.  Apparently
    tickets sell out quickly when they go on sale at 10am 30 days
    ahead of time.  Both for buses and trains.  Tickets to Kyoto sell
    out even more quickly.  I certainly don't want to drive (and chill
    in traffic), but I don't want to stand on a train, either.
15. I'm on the train headed home after a lesson in which we created
    presentations about Kirobo, a new entry in the personal assistant
    space, this time by Toyota.
16. I just had to hard-reboot my phone because it was being a jerk.
17. Lin and I live in Shin Yurigaoka, in our all-electric house,
    featuring IH stove and water heaters.
18. Fred is closer to being Dr Fred than before he bought tix to ACL
which were largely unused.
19.
