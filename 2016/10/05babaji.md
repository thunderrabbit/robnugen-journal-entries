Lin and I went to see Babaji this morning at Paola's house.  I asked
him what to do when I get pissed off at Lin and want to yell at her or
break up with her.  He said when I feel the anger, instead of
quarreling with her, I should walk away until the feeling leaves on
its own.

I asked what to do with the feeling that I've married the wrong
person.  "If she is wrong for you, then you are wrong for her, so you
need to make yourself right for her."
