Why the heck can't I find an Android app that can scp images using ssh
keys?

There are plenty of ssh apps, but not scp.. [VXConnectBot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sk.vx.connectbot) allegedly added
scp to
[ConnectBot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.connectbot&hl=en),
but I don't see how to get scp to work on it.

Ah, I found a way to
[upload files from my phone using VXConnectBot](https://github.com/vx/connectbot/issues/74#issuecomment-20804161).
It's convoluted, and can only do one at a time, but it's better than
zero.
