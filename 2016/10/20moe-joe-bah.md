Why the heck can't I find an Android app that can scp images using ssh
keys?

There are plenty of ssh apps, but not scp.. [VXConnectBot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sk.vx.connectbot) allegedly added
scp to
[ConnectBot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.connectbot&hl=en),
but I don't see how to get scp to work on it.
