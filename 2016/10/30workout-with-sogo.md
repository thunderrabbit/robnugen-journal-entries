Yesterday I joined [SOGO](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sogotko) for their late start after Halloween partying
the night before!  I chatted with Emi who said she had *not* been
partying; in fact had been working the previous night.  Her company
does mobile payments, apparently using an app instead of hardware like
square.  Seems like more trouble for the end user, but maybe I'm
misunderstanding.

The workout was fun; I'm sorta kinda getting better strength and
endurance.  Mike was a bit puffed (thanks Jennie J for that word!),
which is unusual (exept after party night!)

I joined the "advanced / super advanced / Menya" group, whereas I had
joined the "beginner / intermediate" group before.  Wasn't too hard;
I'll stick with that plan from now on.
