## 14:48 Wednesday 12 October 2016 JST

Safely in Honkers, and just waiting for my flight, scheduled to leave
in 70 minutes.  Is it normal to not have a gate listed yet?  Hmmm.

## 14:53

I just overheard the answer from an airport employee:

"Oh!  Too early.  Long time.  Because long time no boarding gate."

## 15:14

At 3pm (2pm local time) the gate was listed: 71.

Walking past all the shops and stuff from gate 44 area to gate 71, I
realized I feel hungry.  Then I realized I have no local currency. D'oh!
