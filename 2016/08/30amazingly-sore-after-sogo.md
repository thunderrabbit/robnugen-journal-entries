Sunday was my first time to join [Suns Out Guns Out](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sogotko) for their weekly
workout in Yoyogi.  We did about 90 minutes of exercises and then ate
lunch (took a long time because of crowds on the street for a parade)
and then played ultimate frisbee for some hours.  Great fun!

Yesterday I was super-crazy sore, but today I'm just sore, so
hopefully tomorrow no worries.

Had sooo much fun; everyone was super friendly!  I'm looking forward
to attending again!  This coming Sunday Lin and I are going to Saitama
for her friend's BBQ, but the next Sunday I will go to SOGO again and
Lin said she would join!
