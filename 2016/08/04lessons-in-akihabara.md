Though we almost got sidetracked with describing days relative to
today, I think our lesson on "a" and "the" went quite well.  I hadn't
taught this lesson in a while.  I remember I used to have a cache of
plastic fat horse characters of a variety of colors and a few
different sizes.  They were perfect for the "a - the" game.

Mayumi created some cards with crayons on them with different colors
and different lengths.  Perfect!!  Super thanks to her for making
those for the lesson.

Next week there's no official lesson, but some (one?) of the students
want(s) to pay cash for a lesson so we'll probably meet in a cafe in
the area.
