## 10:14 Tuesday 02 August 2016 JST

I'm headed to work on the local train; we left 新百合ケ丘 at 10:12am.
I'm not sure what time we'll arrive in 新宿, but I have a seat, my
computer, art supplies, and a snack, so I should be able to keep
myself entertained until we arrive.

Haha just kidding; my main concern is arriving on time, but yeah I
have my computer because I had been reading at home, wondering just
how long I could keep going before rushing off to my meeting on
time... hey wait a minute; if I take a local train I can read *while*
going to work.

AND, Lin just so happened to be driving to her appointment, so I rode
with her to the station.  Lin's mom needed a ride to the clinic, so
she joined the fun.

At the top of the hill, Lin's mom asked (in Japanese), "what's down
that street where the red car is stopped?"  (even though Lin couldn't
see the red car for the car ahead of us on the road.)

Lin goes "MOOooooOOOmmm that's the street with your bus stop!  See the
bank is right there so the bus stop is down there, right??"  (in
Japanese)

The light turned green and we summarily took the road in question.

Now my question: why couldn't Lin just say "oh just a moment; we're
about to go down it so you can see for yourself."  ??
