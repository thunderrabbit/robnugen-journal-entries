## 10:49 Tuesday 09 August 2016 JST

One of my rules of journaling is to just start again instead of trying
to catch up on old events.  So before I break that rule, here's now:

Right now I'm on the train headed to Ebisu to meet S at CB for our
weekly meeting.  I was hoping to have it yesterday cause I was in the
area, and I don't have any other reason to come today.

## Saturday 6 August 2016

On Saturday I went to Mitsue's ukelele event where she sang!  I need
to put the video online, but I want to crop the end off first and I
don't see how to do that easily without uploading it somewhere.  Can
youtube do it?  lgmtfmyself  Great to see her and Soness there too!
Met Mitsue's family; her dad seems quite genki.  He kept whapping my
leg to emphasize his jokes.

On the way home I took the "last bus"
from somewhere and just made my connection to another last bus.
Except that I was on the wrong side of the road and the bus I wanted
zoomed by at exactly the wrong time as I was exactly in the wrong
place.  Dang.  I walked home for about an hour.

## Sunday 7 August 2016

On Sunday I did Mikoshi with the crew from 大島二丁目.  My boy Yuki
got me an outfit and everything.  Mutual recognition with many of the
peeps who were there last year (my first time) and probably many years
before that and many years to come.  When new friends were like "yo
jack why are you barefoot?" by saying more concisely 裸足大丈夫？ The
regulars were like, "it's his policy" hahaha awsome.

Had dinner with Yuki's father at the end, but respectfully declined
this year when they asked if I'd join at the public bath.  It was
great fun last year, but that's when my house was 2 blocks away.  This
year it's 2 hours away.

Arrived home and my shoulder was aching to the extent that I asked Lin
to apply one of those medicated patches that she so dearly loves.
It's still sore but no longer swollen.

## last night 8 August 2016

Okay so last night after I-group, whereas I normally walk to Shibuya
afterward and take Inokashira Line to Shimokitazawa and then Odakyu
Line to our house, I found a much shorter way!  I'll need to compare
prices (and sort out the details), but it should get my home a lot
sooner on I-group nights.

Basically: bus to Shibuya, Denentoshi line to Meidaimaira (sp) and
then a bus bound for Ikuta which stops within 300 meters of our
house.  Nice!  (Walking from Shin Yurigaka is like 4 times that).

Last night I arrived in Maidaimaira (sp) and thought I had the bus
stops figured out but the bus didn't come.  I recalibrated and the
next bus didn't come.  I recalibrated with Google maps again, but this
time I asked the guy at the train window and he looked it up for me.
He confirmed that my new plan was okay, and I had been at the right
stop (but waiting for a different bus).   Anyway the new plan required
changing buses, but the first bus got stuck in construction traffic so
I missed the last bus ... egad. I just wanted to go home.  Fortunately
my phone held its charge long enough for me to take a few quick
glances at maps and I walked home.  1.6 km ftw!
