Though I need to redact some names before making it public source, I
got a pretty cool VagrantFile which uses Ansible to create an instance
on AWS.

The starting point was here
https://github.com/thunderrabbit/episode-45  (actually here
https://github.com/jweissig/episode-45) and I *might* spend time to
put a cleansed version of my new repo online.  Gotta go to work now though.
