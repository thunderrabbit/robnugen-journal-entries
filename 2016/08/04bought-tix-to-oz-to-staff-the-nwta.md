Sweet!  I'll head to Perth again to staff with a bunch of other great
men for their 10 year anniversary training.

Just gotta pay for the tickets by Friday, tell work, my other work,
Lin, and Lin's friend the flight attendant on Cathay Pacific.  Oh, and
the guys in OZ.

Paid for the tickets, primarily with 500 yen coins.  But no, I didn't
dump them on the desk at the travel agency; I put them in the ATM
machine.  (Yep, cash (including change) is accepted by ATMs and
automagically counted, confirmed, and applied to the customer's
account.)

The weird thing was I thought I had 8000 yen in my account, put 73500
yen into my account, and then a couple hours later, pulled out 93000
yen.  Did someone add money to my account or did I misread and/or
misremember 8000 yen?
