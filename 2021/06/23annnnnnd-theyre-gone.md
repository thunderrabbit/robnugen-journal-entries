Hi Rob,

I love seeing the new landing page for your site. Looks really good.

I discovered that I need total a break from facilitating for you. I am making some super personal progress and it is requiring every last bit of my energy.

It has been an honor to watch your confidence and focus increase.  Maybe doing this without me can further solidify the fact that ‘you’ve got this’.
I am interested in receiving updates, if you find that sending me helps you as well.

Please do contact me in a month or so if you are interested in having another meeting.

I am pretty excited for both of us, really.  I see a lot of hope in each of our progress.

Take care,

Hi Rob,

It has been a month. Do you still want to check in? What have you learned this month?

Cheers,

I felt a lot of emotions when our meetings stopped.

I've learned working with you:

* Helped me a lot
* Meant a lot to me
* Was worth money
* Felt empowering
* Felt exciting
* All of the above

I learned how much I crave answers to "what to do now?"

I applaud, respect, and support your choice to take care of yourself.

I learned the importance of systems instead of goals.

I'm developing systems for posting content to my website.

I would love to work with you again, and want to more properly appreciate the support you offer.

It's apparently been a month.

What have you learned?

Do you still want to check in?

    Blessings
    Rob
