Hi Rob,

I love seeing the new landing page for your site. Looks really good.

I discovered that I need total a break from facilitating for you. I am making some super personal progress and it is requiring every last bit of my energy.

It has been an honor to watch your confidence and focus increase.  Maybe doing this without me can further solidify the fact that ‘you’ve got this’.
I am interested in receiving updates, if you find that sending me helps you as well.

Please do contact me in a month or so if you are interested in having another meeting.

I am pretty excited for both of us, really.  I see a lot of hope in each of our progress.

Take care,

Hi Rob,

It has been a month. Do you still want to check in? What have you learned this month?

Cheers,

I felt a lot of emotions when our meetings stopped.

I've learned working with you:

* Helped me a lot
* Meant a lot to me
* Was worth money
* Felt empowering
* Felt exciting
* All of the above

I learned how much I crave answers to "what to do now?"

I applaud, respect, and support your choice to take care of yourself.

I learned the importance of systems instead of goals.

I'm developing systems for posting content to my website.

I would love to work with you again, and want to more properly appreciate the support you offer.

It's apparently been a month.

What have you learned?

Do you still want to check in?

    Blessings
    Rob

Rob,
<br/>Your insights look good.
<br/>I have had a month of clarity and fun developments. 
<br/>It saddens me to let our relationship go, but I realize that I am no longer interested in the emotional dynamic, the old-school female feels the emotions while the man feels calm and superior. I am so glad to be free of codependent relationships.

<br/>I have to say the following. It feels wrong not to:
<br/>Rob, you’ve got integrity. Use it. Face your shit. Talk to your wife about the fact that there is no adulthood as long as your toxic mother-in-law is in the house. Tell her either the mother goes or you go. And then go home to Texas. Bring Lin if that works. Ditch the mkp and its manipulations. Take care of your blood family. Make peace with your ghosts. Get a job with benefits. Deal with what is going on here in the States. Be part of the solution, not mired in the toxicity of the problem.
-->
<br/>
<br/>I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t sad to say goodbye. The work we did together got me to the point that I don’t need that type of relationship anymore. But I know that the energy freed by letting go will enliven my life.
<br/>
<br/>Best,

> the man feels calm and superior

Wait, what?  I never felt superior nor implied that I might.
