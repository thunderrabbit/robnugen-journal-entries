I'm scheduled to speak at two events (so far) in 2022!

One is for https://www.en-joi.com/wolfpack; I'll speak online on March 14th.

The other is for KSSG (Kanagawa something something Group)(?); I'll speak in Yokohama on July 9th.

Wooooo!!

AND, Sho just put together a video for my December 30th walk!

Here is the first version, which has a typo at 0:30
