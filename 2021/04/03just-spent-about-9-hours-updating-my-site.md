MR Laboratories tagline for websites was "Handmade, the way nature
intended"

In that vein, I have just spent 9 hours working on my site, mostly
around retooling plans for April 18th, and adding two walking meditation events to my walk:

* [18 April Higashimurayama Chuo Park](/events/2021/04/18walking-meditation-in-higashimurayama-chuo-park/)
* [18 April along Lake Tama near Seibuen](/events/2021/04/18walking-meditation-along-lake-near-seibuen-amusement-park/)
