Today one of my to do items is to allow me to post from here on Quill to send updates during my walk to Niigata on an ad-hoc basis.

I just removed the stuff that counts the number of characters and hoping that I can edit this thing without having to erase from the end.

Curiously enough, that didn't work but I'm still going to keep the Twitter count removed because I don't care about it for journal entries.

Curiously enough maybe it DID work..  yep it seems fine now so let me commit this change.
