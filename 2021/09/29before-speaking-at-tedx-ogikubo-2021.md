Today is TEDx Ogikubo's first event, and I'll be speaking around 5:45pm.

Robert the organizer has repeatedly assured us we are creating video
recordings, which happen to be done while livestreaming.  If
necessary, just pause, take a breath, and continue.  We'll clean it up
in post edits.

It was great!!  I am super glad everything went so well for me on
stage.  I couldn't see much of the audience at all.  Could just see
Lin and Soness on the front row, cheering me on!
