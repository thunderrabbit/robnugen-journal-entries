Inside Out is the latest Pixar film I've seen.  It hilariously and
perfectly describes how emotions seem to work in our minds.  Emotions
in balance lead to a normal life, while unchecked emotion of any
persuasion can lead to a bit of a disaster.  I love how it answers so
many unasked questions!  "Ohhh! This explains why that happens!!"

Anyway, go see it.  I hope to see it with Lin sometime.  It's actually
a reasonably good introduction into the idea of emotional growth.
