I started playing Minecraft (again) a couple days ago.  I'm back on
the [Delta Minecraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/deltaminecraft/)
server.  This time I dug my traditional staircase, but it's under a
mountain coated in two big lava flows, including one that dumps into
my living room.

The staircase goes down down down and looks a lot like a staircase,
but I've started digging out the rock *around* the staircase, so when
walking down the stairs, we're actually walking down a thin tube of
rock (though it's not apparent while inside the tube).  It just looks
like a staircase.

Seems a lot like a waste of time, „Å≠.
