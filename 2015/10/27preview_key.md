Today S at CB requested they be able to preview articles before
they're published.  I was like, "um, it's already finished," because
Alfonzo wrote that functionality ages ago.

"Wow! I didn't know that."

So now they want to preview other things, so I'll be copying his code
to those other not-yet-previewable things.
