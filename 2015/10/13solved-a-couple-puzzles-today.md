I solved the chain tree and the tetrahedron today at the toy store.
They both vexed me last week and maybe the week before.  But today I
was like rar and luckily solved the tetrahedron, and systematically
solved the chain tree.

I didn't memorize either solution, but I probably won't try to do them
again, either.
