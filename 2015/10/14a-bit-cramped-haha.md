Though amazingly, we each have AC power available at each seat, it's a
bit cramped to have my computer on the tray table in front of me.  As
I type this, I'm actually using my USB keyboard while it's on my legs
*under* the tray table.

Mouse motion is a bit cramped as well, so it's not a very good
environment for computin', but I figured I'd give it a shot.  Lunch is being
served now.
