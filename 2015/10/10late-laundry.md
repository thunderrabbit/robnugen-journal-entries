## 11:41 Saturday 10 October 2015 JST

I usually wake up at 5am, start the laundry then <del>study
Japanese</del> <del>work on stuff</del> go back to bed for an hour,
then hang the laundry to dry.

Today I didn't do it early, and then was like oops!  and just started
it at 11:30.  It was an oops because the wash won't finish until
12:15, 15 minutes after I'm supposed to meet Tariq.  So while I was
doing the laundry, I considered asking him to delay, and then I
considered asking him to ask to delay.

It worked!  He requested that we start at 2pm.
