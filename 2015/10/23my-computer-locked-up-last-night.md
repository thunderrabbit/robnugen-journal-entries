I woke my computer from sleep, and it didn't respond to any
keypresses, either from its own keyboard or the USB keyboard.  The
mouse cursor wouldn't move, using either the trackpad or USB mouse.
The only key which worked was the power key.  I pressed it for a while
and the dialog boxed popped up: Are you sure you want to shut down the
computer?  Yes, but I couldn't select any of the buttons. So I just
held the power key and powered it off.
