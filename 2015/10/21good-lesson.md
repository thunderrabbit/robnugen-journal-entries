Today's lesson was great because I remembered what I said we would do:
short presentations on any topic the students liked.  About half
actually brought something, and we did four presentations out of five
people who came:

1. a ほや or sea squirt phone attachment
1. a black pen
1. a travel magazine
1. a pack of cigarettes

The fifth looked like a little rubber man whose body was draped over a
cliff and he was hanging on for his life.  Uh oh!
