I showed Mutsumi how my bag is losing its stuffing which regularly
gets stuck in the ports on my laptop.  She suggested making a slip for
the computer.  Wow!  I had only thought about buying covers for it,
but rejected the idea because they're usually a bit bulky, and almost
certainly overpriced.  Bah.

Hmmm!  *Making* a cover could be just the thing...  and she said she
might make it!  Wow!  So lucky and happy!
