subject: *pre-sales questions about Anker USB 3.0 9-Port Hub + 5V 2.1A Charging Port*

    Your hub at https://www.ianker.com/product/68ANHUB-B10A won lifehacker's poll (https://lifehacker.com/most-popular-usb-hub-anker-7-port-and-9-port-powered-u-1433052505), and you seem to have a lot of fans on Twitter, so I'm about 10 minutes from making a purchase!
    
    BUT, I want to confirm that this product, will, in fact, solve my USB problems.
    
    I would like to connect multiple devices to my computer:
    
    * Apple USB keyboard
    * small elecom Mouse (daisy-chained to keyboard)
    * iPhone 4S (soon to be upgraded to Android something something)
    * Logicool USB camera
    * printer (with its own power supply)
    * iPad or some other tablet
    
    However, I cannot currently do so with a non-powered USB splitter.  My computer complains that they're drawing too much power.
    
    Is your USB 3.0 9-Port Hub + 5V 2.1A Charging Port up to the task?
    
    Does the "power" part of the Hub keep the computer from complaining about power shortages?
    
    If so, then count one more customer and be prepared for some more happy Tweets!
    
    If not, is there a way to solve this... which doesn't include moderation????
    
       Thanks!

Though I may have missed it, I don't think they answered.  Boo.
