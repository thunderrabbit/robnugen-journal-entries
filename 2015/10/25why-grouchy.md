Why do I get so grouchy when I have to repeat myself.  I see the words
"have to" there, but I mean when I say something and Lin didn't hear
me/ didn't understand me/ wasn't listening, and she goes, "what?" (or
says nothing at all.)

Hideo at CPC repeats himself all the time because he's often in charge
of 10 or 15 people, all of whom are kinda doing their own thing, or
possibly on different schedules.

I'm always so impressed when I see people repeat themselves for people
who weren't listening.  I fucking hate it.  What's triggering that
hate/anger?

Back in Houston, I was looking at this issue, and had a spontaneous
memory which I'm calling a memory from a past life because, well, I
remember telling my army buddy he was loading a weapon incorrectly,
and after he didn't listen, he was killed by it when he fired it.

I was never in the army so it's an interesting memory for me.

But there's still more triggering this thing because crying about my
army buddy's death doesn't seem to have resolved everything.

Speaking English in Japan gives me ample opportunity to look at this
issue.
