    HI Ken
    
    I have just discovered I made the most amazing fuckup imaginable and
    cannot teach the lesson on Wednesday.  I will try to find somebody to
    cover it.
    
    I'm totally embarrassed because I specifically told you that I don't
    fuck around with my schedule like that, and yet I did.  I'm sorry, and
    I know "sorry" is meaningless.  I will help find someone to cover it.
