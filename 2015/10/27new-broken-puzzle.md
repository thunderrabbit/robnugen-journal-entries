From the toy store today I received a maze puzzle which had been
broken by some careless use.  They said they couldn't sell it, so they
gave it to me.  yay!

I think I can fix it, if I can just loosen one particular screw
holding the broken piece on the puzzle.

If I can loosen that screw, I can take it all apart, fix the broken
bits and put it back together.  (and give it to Fred for winter
solstice.)
