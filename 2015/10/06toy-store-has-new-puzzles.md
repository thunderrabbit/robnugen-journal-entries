The best new puzzle was a wooden chain like a bicycle chain except
some of its links were fixed, as if they were rusty and wouldn't
rotate, except they were actually uncut pieces of wood.  Apparently,
it's possible to arrange the chain on a tree shaped board so that all
the links exactly cover the tree, including one at the bottom for the
trunk.  There's a link featuring a star which seems to fix that point
at the top.  I wasn't able to solve it this evening, but I'll do it
before it goes out of season!

Another puzzle had pieces kinda like an angular burr puzzle, but these
could apparently be arranged to fill a tetrahedronal shape.  BUT
(there's a trick): <!-- there are hollow spots in the middle -->
<del>view source to view</del> (hmmm I don't have spoiler tags set up
on this thing, but I hid the spoiler within html comments).
