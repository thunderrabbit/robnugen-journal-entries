After a nice lunch, and a nice nap, I decided to break out the art
supplies and draw some art!

I brought four blank paperboard panels (I think they're called
shikishi in Japanese), some pastel colored markers, and some bright
colored markers.

Hmmm what to do, oh what to do.  This is always my question when
starting a new piece.  I decided to go with bright green.  I took out
the marker, started to draw a sweeping curve.... but no ink came out.
Actually it's paint, and I haven't used them in a while so maybe it's
just a bit dried out.

I poked the nib of the marker on my pants leg and got the paint
flowing again.

Unfortunately, I didn't take a picture of the result just after it
happened, but the flight attendants were super friendly and
accomodated me with wet towels to clean the paint off my pants.

Dang. I try to be so careful to consume as little as possible, but I
guess those three or four hand towels can begin their new lives as
rags or maybe as filler for a landfill.  Sigh.

The flight attendants told me to not worry about the seat cushion,
saying the cleaning staff could clean it...  Yeah maybe, but that's
paint.  Unless these cushion covers are rated to be cleaned with
turpentine.
