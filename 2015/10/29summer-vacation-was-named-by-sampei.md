In this morning's lesson, Sampei named my latest drawing "Summer
Vacation" after I asked him for a suggestion.  I loved it, and
immediately wrote the name on the back, plus "(named by Sampei)"
though I forgot to put the date that he named it.  So here it is, in
my journal.

I worked on the piece a bit more, actually encompassing one of the
baseball looking shapes in the background colors.   Just several more
hours to go!
