#  GG long lesson

<p class="dream">
I looked up at the clock and stopped mid-sentence.  "What?  Is it
1:30am?  Oh my god I must have fallen asleep!  I can only remember
maybe 45 minutes extra, but it's been three hours!!"  I asked each one
if they fell asleep but they wer lie (shrug) "no not really" but I was
sure they were just not sure because we were all groggy.  I apologized
a lot and wondered how it could have happened!

# Cover Soness's lesson

<p class="dream">
Soness was going to drop in on a lunch meeting with some organization
which she determined had a meeting somewhere in Shibuya.  She asked if
I could cover her lesson in the same timeslot.  I admired her ability
to join the meeting; it wasn't something I could do, so I was like,
"sure I can teach for you!"
