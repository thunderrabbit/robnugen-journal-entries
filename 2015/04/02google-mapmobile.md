I saw a car with a Google branding and a multi-windowed ball on
top. Ah!  The Google Mapmobile!  I was on Lin's bicycle so I zoomed
along beside/behind the car as much as possible, then stopping at
lights as it got stopped.  I didn't stare at it like crazy but I'm
sure I'll be in a fair few frames along the street we were on
together.
