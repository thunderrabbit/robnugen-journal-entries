I've been tootling through a couple tutorials on ~~noobtoots~~
[noobtuts](http://www.noobtuts.com), and each time had to set up the same settings for git,
including a .gitignore file.

So, I made
[unity3d-starter](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/unity3d-starter) to
get me started.

I'm now going through their
[bejeweled tutorial](http://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-bejeweled-game) (and
paid 2000 yen for their premium package to get the full toot and
source code).
