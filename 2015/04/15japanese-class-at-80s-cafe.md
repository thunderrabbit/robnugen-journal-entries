Lin came with me today to 80s Cafe for Japanese class! She said she
enjoyed it a lot and will come to Chinese class on Saturdays if she
has time.

We sat at a table with ドアンさん and にこにこさん.  Nikoniko was
quite fluent in Japanese, though his native language is Chinese.  Adan
is French, and his English is quite good.  His Japanese is a bit above
my level.  But I'm catchin' up quick! rar.

Funny: we three guys are all programmers.
