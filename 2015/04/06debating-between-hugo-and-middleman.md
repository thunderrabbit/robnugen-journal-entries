I'd like to use Hugo because it's faster and places my sample unity
games exactly as I would like, but it gives a 404 on the all Japanese
filenames I've been creating recently.  Bah. I wonder if that's a
simple fix.  I sure don't want to cobble/clobber my filenames to fit
its whims.

I'd like to use Middleman except it's slower, and puts the unity files
in a `static/` directory on root instead of on root.  That's wack, and
I posted an issue in their
forum. [reroute all files in static to root during build phase](https://forum.middlemanapp.com/t/reroute-all-files-in-static-to-root-during-build/1734)
