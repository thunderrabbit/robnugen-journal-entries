<p class="dream">In a slightly enclosed area, Travis and I were
playing a version of baseball.  We would each take one turn at bat,
and keep track of where our ghost players had made it around the
bases.  We were pretty well tied, though we kept getting hits.  It was
my turn at bat, and someone gave me a broken bat as a joke, so I used
it as a joke and got a pretty good hit, making it to third base,
though Travis tagged home base before my ghost runner would have made
it there.  I was sure next time I could make it to first, and
therefore my ghost on third would get a run.</p>
