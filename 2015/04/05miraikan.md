Just finished lunch with peeps after seeing Miraikan first floor
exhibits.  I forgot to write during lunch; we're leaving now.

## 13:04

We're in line for the floating flower garden.

Downstairs there were several interesting interactive exhibits.  My
favorite was a table with 300cc colored wooden blocks.  Cameras above
the table would detect the blocks and lights above the table would
project rivers between blue blocks, planes flying between yellow
blocks, railroad between red blocks, and highway between green blocks,
and maybe helicopter landing pads on purple blocks (maybe).

Lots of kids were just tossing the blocks around, causing the terrain
to be redrawn quite quickly!

I considered slowly collecting the blocks as they were tossed off the
table until there were no more on the table, so the kids would get
bored and then we'd be able to experiment without their godzillian
antics.

We went through a mockup of the ISS, which featured a floor on the
earth-facing side instead of more handled panels.

I skipped a very crowded animatronic robot thing.  I'll wait until the
crowds die down and the AI can actually have a chat with me.

I was enamored with a giant marble track thing that allowed people to
send four characters to any of a few different stations.  Messages
consisted of 8 bits to identify the station to which the remaining 8
bits of the message should be sent.  Each bit was encoded with a black
or white ball.

I'm not sure what encoding was used, but I bet it was made
specifically for the exhibit.  They encoded 0-9A-Zア-ヲ and couple
other symbols (hearts and stars).

After crepes, Jon and I went back in to see if the green tables were
less crowded.  They were slightly so, so we were able to test the
detectors a bit.  The first time I put Francois on the table, he was
marked as a highway point, but on subsequent placements, he was
ignored altogether or scanned and rejected.  Some women next to us
determined the cases on their cellphones worked.  My phone on its
front or back wouldn't work, but when it was standing on end, the
computer marked it as a highway point.

Then back with our group under the large video ball (spherical display
screen made of around 2000 little square video screens)

(wow we just did a rough count measurement and calculation and got 12000
square video screens!)

There, Emma and Kaito (ages 9 and 4 or so) laughed as they fed snacks
to me, Jon, and Lin.  I was game, but Lin and Jon were like, "もういい
" and "okay stop" respectively.

Some kids nearby had some magnets that made a neat noise when thrown
in proximity of each other, so I asked where the got them, and they
led me to the spot in the shop.  Nice!  I bought some and two little
spring launchy things which we played with as well.

Then そろそろ time to go and we walked to....  ice cream shop for more
chat and chill before heading home.

Jon, Lin and I are on りんかい線 now headed home.  He's debating
between going to Shibuya and having a longer walk or changing in Ebisu
and taking more stairs.
