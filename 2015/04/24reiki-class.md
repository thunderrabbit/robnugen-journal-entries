Just said bye to Tomoko after reiki class in Matsudo.  We took the
same train from Matsudo to Kita-Senju and now I'm headed back to Ye
Olde Kawasaki, though this train terminates in Shinagawa.  I imagine I
could have waited longer in Matsudo in order to get a seat all the
way, but there were no such trains on the marquee when we left.

Anyway, reiki class was nice, featuring 5 students and our instructor
Nobuko.  Everyone is really sweet and help me when I don't understand
the Japanese.
