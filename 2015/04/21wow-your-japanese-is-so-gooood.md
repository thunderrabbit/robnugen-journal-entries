If I hear someone say "hello" in English, I say "hi" or something.

I don't say "your English is so good!"

I wish my Japanese was good enough to explain gently why こんにちは
should not be returned with laughter.

After she laughed, I said 「面白いですね〜」and walked out.  I know
that's not the right response when someone laughs after I say the
equivalent of hello, but fuck. What should I do?

The fuller story:  I go into a small fruit shop a few times a week and
the shop staff know I can say a few words related to the price of
bananas in their shop and that I like to be barefoot.

Today I went and another customer was there.  The shop clerk said
"[his] Japanese is good" (twice!) so I played nice and said "hello" to
the other customer.  She giggled (nervously?)...  I mean just fucking
say HI man; it's not that hard.
