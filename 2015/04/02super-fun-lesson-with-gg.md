Super fun lesson today with GG; just going in to the room, just before
which time I had purchase a poor-me chocolate bar, I felt all my
grouchiness lift away and no need to chow chocolate!

We laughed a lot and they said they learned a lot; it's really a great
class.

This is the day I paid 100 yen each of two times that GGE translated
something into Japanese unnecessarily.  She said she didn't have the
money handy so I pulled it out of my wallet as a symbol that it's
srsbzns: please only use English during the lesson(!)

After the lesson she matched my 200 yen after getting her bag; so now
there's 400 yen in the pot.
