Okay I've actually followed the toot a bit, but I know where I'm
branching off.  I think the key is with the Pixels Per Unit.  In the
tutorial, each gem is exactly one game unit wide,...  that explains
why they simply cannot exist in between the grid positions.  This
in-between existence is critical for our game, so that's what I gotta
figure out next.

But right now headed to the toy store.
