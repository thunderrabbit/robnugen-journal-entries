<p class="dream">Soness and them went over to the right and I got
caught up in a crowd, so I turned the other way and went straight to
the stage where we were about to perform.  The director was like, "hey
Rob!" and "ya know, I see you each day right in the center of the gap
in the crowd way up on the top seating area." and I go "well, it's the
center!" and "by the way I have shoes on because I didn't take them
off last night to sleep!" I realized, because I sure hadn't put on
shoes recently...  </p>
