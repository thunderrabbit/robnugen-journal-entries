Play a
[silent version of bejeweled](https://thunderrabbit.github.io/unity-bejeweled-via-noob-tuts/silent_bejeweled/),
via [noobtuts bejeweled tutorial](https://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-bejeweled-game).

The ~~[code](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/unity-bejeweled-via-noob-tuts)~~ is really wasteful, but it works faster than needed to be too
fast for me to see what's going on!

(( update: code has been deleted from github by request of the author.  (oops, sorry about that.) ))

Here's the [original
bejeweled](https://bejeweled.popcap.com/html5/0.9.12.9490/html5/Bejeweled.html),
all noisy and stuff.

Now I'm going to take a nap because I'm fasting today, and will head
out to Japanese class at 6pm or so.

Nice nap, though I'm going to be a bit late to the lesson.  (I'm on
the train now.)

Hmm.  Can't find any hits in offline docs for "sleep" "pause" "wait" to do what I want.. slow this game down!
