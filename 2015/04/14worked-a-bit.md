Finally got approval for a thing I did like 3 weeks ago, so I moved it
to the live server.  Then they were like, yeah but what about this:
it's not working.  and showed me the URL

    www.example.com/report/xml

um, yeah, that's because I told you it was

    demo.example.com/news/xml

It's on the demo server because you haven't approved it and it's the
news URL because that what you originally requested to be updated.
