Shibata-san and I went to the kebab place called King Kebab on 竹下通り in Harajuku.
The shop is in a very girly area, coated in pink and hearts with
hearthrob posters around the walls.  We laughed about that; it's
almost embarrassing to be seen in there! haha

She asked about the science museum Miraikan and I said it was cool
with lots of kids, but didn't go in to detail about the exhibits.

We talked about politics a bit, up to my limit of "I don't like Abe"
and I wondered why he's in office if no one (that I know) seems to
like him.  I didn't understand her answer though.

Afterward, it was like "see ya never!" because she's switching to a
different location (Tachikawa), and will only sporadically be in the
Harajuku office for meetings.
