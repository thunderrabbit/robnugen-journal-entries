Ted went outside a couple days ago and hasn't come back.  After a
discussion about who's more interested in having Ted come back and
what's the best way to "make" him come back, I went outside with Lin
as she called his name and tried to coax him out from wherever he may
be, which we assume is near our house.

Didn't find him which didn't surprise me.  I wish Lin could just trust
he's happy with his decision and let him come back if/as he deigns to
do so.
