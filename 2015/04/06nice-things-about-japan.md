While walking toward my Japanese class, I spotted a wallet in the
street.  Inside featured keys, some change, some loyalty cards
(including the owner's name), and a SUICA (prepaid train card).  Stuff
that he/she could replace but would be a pain to do so.

I took it to the nearest police station and didn't give them my info,
though the officer made a point of calling an English speaker to
explain my rights: I could request(?) a reward for having returned it.
(Not sure if I can request a reward or just be eligible for one if the
owner offered.)

If it had been loaded with cash, I may have opted to give them my
infos, but not in this case.  That'd be more trouble than it's worth.

THEN, I went to buy a snack at the conveni(ence store).  I paid with
the equivalent with a $100 bill and the guy gave me my change without
blinking an eye: 9850 yen.  Then he *left my $100* on the counter
while he walked over to get the snack from the hot box thing.  Hahaha.
I'm sure there's five million cameras everywhere, but still.  I took a
pic. (though I don't have internizzle access to upload it atm *)

(* atm = at the moment)
