Thanks to MDX for sending his veggies with rootballs included so I
could just pop them back in the dirt!

I'm not sure which is which, but I think the one in the plastic pot is
cabbage, while the others are a bit fluffier.

Hopefully they'll all grow and be happy!

Hopefully we can expand our garden from here!  This is actually on our
neighbor's property, but he gave Lin his blessing.  We are actually
both renting from the same property owner so it all works out the
same.
