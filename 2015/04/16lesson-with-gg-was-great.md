Lesson with GG last night was great as usual.  They all did good
homework, and I got good feedback that the previous homework had been
too difficult.

T gave good reasoning, and I was like, "hmmm you're right!!" and
explained that in my Japanese "book" (Textfugu), the author said he
has cut out all the Japanese that we don't really need, just focusing
on the 20%.  "I can do that for you guys, too!"
