As Lin left this morning, she was like, "don't let Jennie out!" and I
was like, "of course!" and I noticed that I could put the chain on the
door so it only opens this much she wouldn't be able to get out.  That
way she'll be safe and happy!

oh shit she getting out!  I tried to close the door to carefully hold
her without crushing her (cats hate that!) and I had her at her hips.
But then she just twisted her back legs sideways and was like, "bye!"

fuck

I had to fully close the door in order to unlock the chain, and by
that time she was 5 yards away, which is like 5 yard more than needed
for her to bolt quickly enough that I'd never catch her.

Fuck

So I've locked the chain again and propped the door open with my shoe
in hopes she'll come back before Lin does!
