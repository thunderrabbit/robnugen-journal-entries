Actually I can't say I've been working on it hard as I've been filling
free time with Unity programming, but I haven't settled on a static
site generator.  I might post a query on Hugo forums to ask how to get
all-Japanese titles to work in URLs.

I still haven't given Jekyll a good shake, and I can't remember why I
didn't like Hexo.  And I found a ton more to consider on
