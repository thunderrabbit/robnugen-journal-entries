Monday class

1. どんなに＿＿＿も＿＿＿

Class was fun today, though I was on a phone call until 30 minutes
after class started.  I did a mini presentation on bluebonnets, saying
maybe 5 sentences, including "I'm Rob from Texas," and "I have no
idea"

Spoke at length with いのさん　(井野さん?) after class about bitcoin
(I'm wearing my bittippers shirt) and tried to explain how it all
works, why it's valuable, how btc are dispersed, how I got bitcoins,
and about micropayments, including /r/bittippers, etc.
