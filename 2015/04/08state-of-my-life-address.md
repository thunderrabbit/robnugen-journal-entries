Oops we're arriving in Yokohama soon so not much time to write.

1. Ted ran away; he has been gone 2 days.
1. I've been working on body and soul website with Sho
1. I've been doing AB website for past couple years but not a lot of work now.
1. I've been taking Japanese lessons at 80s Cafe in Akihabara, up to 3
   times per week (for about 2 weeks now).  Have also been studying
   flashcards on Anki, Memrise, and reading TextFugu
1. I'm a bit behind on mazes, well not "behind" exactly but just up to
   date.  Need to get some more done quickly to get ahead of schedule
   again.
1. Teaching for JB school a few days per week.  Teaching on Tuesday
   mornings and evenings, Wednesday evenings, Thursday mornings and
   evenings, and some weekend days.
1. Have been practicing Unity 2D development, trying to put as much on
   github as possible (but recently removed some code from noobtuts'
   premium offering).
1. I'm somewhat happy with my current direction of my website
   setup.. I've got b.robnugen.com just serving images (b for
   "binary", a throwback to the old FTP days where we had to tell
   which way to transfer the files, as ascii or binary).
   www.robnugen.com goes to my old account, but .htaccess quickly
   tosses those requests to new.robnugen.com, which is still a bit
   wonky as I've not got my static site generator quite set up.
   Middleman is slow as fuck and Hugo can't handle all-utf-8
   filenames.
   My end goal is to write a static site that contains all the content
   from robnugen.com (journal, writings (including the inane stuff
   from my wiki (R.O.B.O.T. and other crap I've forgotten), and
   possibly old crap I didn't write), and new stuff: Unity samples,
   etc.
   All of that should be kept in git via main repo and submodules.
1. Tariq and I have essentially finished our set of Japanese apps
   based on Apple Memory and its little siblings.  One misspelling fix
   is waiting for approval now, and we're trying to get the other app
   approved, but they're saying it's confusingly similar to some other
   app, which it's not similar to at all.
1. TJ Bike is outside, but his seat is ripped and soaked with
   rainwater a lot of the time.  His chain is rusty, but we don't have
   an indoor place to keep him.  I've just been using Lin's bike, who
   has new tires, but no name.
1. In Unity, so far, I've just gone through noobtuts tutorials: Pong,
   Tetris, and Bejeweled. I am trying to jump into my own project, but
   maybe I should keep going through their other toots.
1. Each time I go down to Fukuura for my lesson, I take the KQ line to
   something something station, where I take the Seaside Line, which
   is fun because there's no driver and I can sit in front.
1. Lin is working in real estate again; it's busy and sometimes
   stressful, but she's glad to be back in the industry.
1. Fred and I were talking nearly every day for a while, but haven't
   in the past week or so.  I've not talked to Ma for a while, but my
   dad called me on my most recent birthday.
1. ママ lives in our house downstairs; she's still working early
   shifts.  I've vaguely been able to speak with her more since I
   started studying Japanese.
1. My phone is iPhone 4S which I've had for a while.  My computer is
   aluminum MacBookPro which I've had for about 3 years now.  It's
   about to go out of warranty.  When it can no longer handle the most
   up-to-date OS X, I'm gonna put Ubuntu on it, and when it's too
   tired for even that, I'll get a non-Apple laptop.
1. I've been doing 100 pushups per day. I did extra yesterday and only
   20 or so today, but I'm at 773 for the month, thanks to PUWF (push
   ups with friends)
