Good lesson with Mutsumi; her English is certainly improving, though
she doesn't see it! We've been working on past perfect / past
continuous / present continuous.

Her husband joined us near the end of the lesson and gave me a cool
navy/dark gray/olive camouflage suit jacket!  wow!  It's barely too
small for me, but definitely wearable!
