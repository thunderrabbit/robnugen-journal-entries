Making better progress on Unity game after watching some basic
videos. and I mean *basic*.

1. [What is the Minimum Viable Product?  Okay, that's your goal.](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/your-first-game/how-to-start-your-game-development)
2. [make and keep production goals](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/your-first-game/setting-and-keeping-production-goals)
3. [keep it simple omg](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/your-first-game/how-to-scope-small-and-start-right)

According to the third video, the type of game we are making is the
4th (of 9?)th most difficult type of game to make.  Ah well screwit
let's just see what happens.

Anyway, version 2 features [three sprites and three walls](/samples/unity3d/ah/02-three-sprites-three-walls/).
