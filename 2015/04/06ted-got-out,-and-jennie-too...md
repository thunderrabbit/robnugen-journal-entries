I apparently left the sliding glass door unlocked yesterday; Ted
opened it and got outside.  He hasn't come back, though we've seen him
on the balcony opposite ours.

Jennie and Ted usually sleep in the bed with Lin, and sometimes with
me, but last night Jennie slept in the bed reserved for cats.

And today when ママ came home, Jennie bolted out the door, looking for
Ted, I'm sure!

Lin texted me tonight, saying Jennie got out.  Lin's pretty sad and
worried, but she's never had cats before.  I'm on the way home so I'll
find out soon the latest feline antics!
