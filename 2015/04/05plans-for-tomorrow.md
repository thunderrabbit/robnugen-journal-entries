In addition to catching up on pushups, (assuming I can't do 100
tonight,) (my goal is 100 per day this month,) and catching up on
Japanese study, I hope to retool the bejeweled game so the pieces move
slower than light speed.  Oh, and try to find the light speed game for
Travis, who had a dream about my having created a game that included
relativistic effects.

1. ~~100 pushups for April 5th~~
1. ~~100 pushups for April 6th~~

I crossed out the items I finished today.  I need to draw a maze
because it's due in a few hours!!!  I don't have ny queued up at the
moment.

I fixed the Japanese apps but haven't resubmitted them.  It's such a
chore each time to repost all new screenshots etc omg.  Maybe I won't
have to and it will save all previous data.

I looked for the light speed game but couldn't find it for sure.

Worked on stuff for sbstrm instead of doing Bejeweled (or submitting
Japanese apps).

To do SSL, I popped both new.robnugen.com and b.robnugen.com onto
Cloudflare (single checkbox does it on Dreamhost's control panel)...
BUT then I couldn't connect via SSH to my accounts (without doing
something else apparently and I didn't want to look for it.. so "bah"
and I switched them back.)

I'll do SSL when the new browser-backed free service comes online in a
few months.
