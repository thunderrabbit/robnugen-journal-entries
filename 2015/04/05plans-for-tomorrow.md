In addition to catching up on pushups, (assuming I can't do 100
tonight,) (my goal is 100 per day this month,) and catching up on
Japanese study, I hope to retool the bejeweled game so the pieces move
slower than light speed.  Oh, and try to find the light speed game for
Travis, who had a dream about my having created a game that included
relativistic effects.

1. 100 pushups for April 5th
