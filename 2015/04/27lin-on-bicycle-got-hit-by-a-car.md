On my way home yesterday there was an ambulance and police car next to
traffic light near our house.  Lin's uncle was there and he goes
"Lin's in the ambulance"

!!!

Holy shit wait what?

I was so relieved to see her alert and essentially "fine" though it's
still super spooky fuck fuck fuck!

I didn't have my computer at the time so I didn't write about it last
night.

Right now she is talking to a guy from her insurance company I think,
explaining the situation.

For some reason, no one got the car driver's insurance information
last night, even though police were called and documented the
accident.

The lady said she didn't know the insurance info, and didn't give any
info except her own name and phone number.

She said she'd have her insurance people call, but they haven't yet
(which is why I'm starting to document this situation).

After the accident, Lin's mom and aunt happened across her; they were
going to eat dinner in the nearby restaurant.  I don't know when her
uncle arrived.  I arrived on my way home, saw him, and he told me to
go back to the ambulance.

Lin's mom and aunt were in there with her, and Lin said she'd prefer
to have me with her and they went to dinner while Lin and I went to
the hosptial.

We were in the ambulance for a bit while they asked a couple questions
about allergies and sorted out an available hospital.  We went to
Saiwai Hospital in Kawasaki.

They took a CT scan which the radiologist said appears normal.
