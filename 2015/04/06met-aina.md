Met a young woman named Aina (愛奈) today while wandering around
Akihabara taking some video for a guy on Fiverr.  She approached me
with a small pamphlet, and I had time to spend chatting so I said HI.

She said we can go on a date, and I resisted teasing her, "oh so
you'll be my girlfriend?" and asked what kind of date?  Like go to
dinner or karaoke..  I asked her name and she said Aina.  I asked if
her first kanji means "love" and she was like, "oh no love hotel or
anything (for our "date")."

Oh no no sorry for misunderstanding; I mean your kanji.. Does it mean
"love" and she said yes and we chatted a bit.  She lives in Kawasaki
as well!  Down on Nambu Line a few stops from Kawasaki.  Interesting!
She's 21 so she was 9 when I came to Japan.  Wow.
