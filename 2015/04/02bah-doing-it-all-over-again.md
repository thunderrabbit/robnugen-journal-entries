The project was originally described as "keep the same structure and just change
all the text."

Cool sounds good, and it paid relatively well.

Once I accepted, it was, "oh and put up a full page banner with four
clickable images below it while we change all the text and change all
the images"

Fine fuckit so I put the banner up and I changed all the images; it
was still fair pay for the total amount of work.

Okay, so we changed all the text (and some CSS), and all the images,
some of which were in jpg while the site requested png, and alll of
which were misnamed, but fine it's done. Gimme my money.

"Oh, sorry. The boss doesn't like the colors; need to replace all the
images *again*."

Okay, now it's no longer funny.  I haven't gotten paid the first
amount yet and now it's near double work, and work that could have
been avoided, imho.

"Oh and change some of the text again, and can check why the email
isn't working?"  So even my project manager doesn't know anything
about web.  The link was &lt;a href="address@domain.com">email
us!&lt;/a> which is obviously not going to work!

"Oh and though I didn't mention it before, can you make all the
outgoing links open in a new tab?"

"oh and add some text to each of these h4s but make them smaller so
the text doesn't go past two lines, and add a new paragraph here and
two new paragraphs there?"

bah.
