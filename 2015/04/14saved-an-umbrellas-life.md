For some reason I didn't bring my umbrella today.  It's honestly not
raining *that* much, but I'm in a suit, blah blah blah.

Umbrellas are apparently the *most* often forgotten items and *least*
claimed items in lost and founds.  It's common to see bundles of
umbrellas being thrown away as the owners never came back to claim
them from whereever they've accumulated.

So,

I went to the convenience store where I go each week (and used to go 6
days a week).  「あの、エコーのため、古い傘をいただけますか？」
"considering the environment, can you give me an old umbrella (instead
of me buying one?)"

He was like, "sure!" and went to the back to get one.  Nice.
