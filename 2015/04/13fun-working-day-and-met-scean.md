Just finished eating sakura ice cream with Scean, Kasagawa, and
another guy whose name I didn't get.  We talked a lot (though I didn't
ask for permission to transcribe his interesting stories)!

This was all after about 6 hours of group lessons, all coordinated
from the front of the room; basically the lesson content wasn't
difficult but all the coordination took a bit of focus.  I didn't
think to bring water, so by the end I was a little parched and had a
bit of a headache, but bare feet in the rain took care of that quite
quickly!

We all chowed at a restaurant, and it was a quite nice experience
overall.  I kinda wanted to stay, but I really want to improve my
Japanese so I'm going to class now.
