Wow cool!  I met a guy in Akihabara station as he was looking at the
train map. I happened to know he could get to Kichijoji station on the
Sobu Line so I walked him upstairs to it.

He described having been to an interesting sounding workshop thing,
and gave me a sticker from there.

Wow what?  This DMM is the logo of an adult video company.  He was
like, "wow yeah" because apparently part of the presentation tonight
had been "yeah DMM does AV but this isn't that."

Lasse's cards are quite thick!  Like easily the thickness of 5 normal
cards.  Maybe I'll do the same with no amazeaweek cards, and carve a
maze into them.   Mmmmmaayyybe.

I'll certainly ask him if he can (suggest someone who can) redesign my
maze site.

Speaking of which, I gotta make a maze!
