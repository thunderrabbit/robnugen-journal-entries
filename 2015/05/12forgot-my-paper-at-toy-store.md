Today I found a little computer touch screen terminal in Ebisu
station: "Route Finder"

Hmm! Well in time for the olympics! I decided to test the machine by
entering the two farthest cities I could think of at the moment:
Wakkanai and Nagasaki.  Now I realized Kagoshima would be further than
Nagasaki.

Next week, machine, be ready!

I showed it to the guy at the toy store, but then forgot to grab it on
my way out.  D'oh!
