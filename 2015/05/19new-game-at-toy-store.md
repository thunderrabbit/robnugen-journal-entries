柴田さん showed me a new-to-me game at the toy store.  Roll a bunch of
dice and players take turns selecting as many of the same-color /
same-face dice that they wish.  The person who is left with the last
die is the loser.

She was shocked that I hadn't seen the game before!

We also played with the tops, one of which was a round block of wood
with a pencil for its axle.  We spun it and drew patterns remniscent
of spirograph.

AND, they are so great; they kept the train route I had printed last
week and gave it to me this week.

That reminds me, I recently thought of a different way to experience
life, or maybe a different way to frame existence here on earth.

gotta go bye!
