workshop today

## 16:47

The workshop was quite great, though specifically geared toward
teaching children. I'm sure I'll be able to apply some of the stuff I
learned to my classes.

Mostly I learned "It's not the answer that matters so much; it's the
thinking."

This quote might summarize the content of the workshop and the
presentation of the workshop itself.

And I tried to play it cool, but I got big crush on K, next to whom I
sat during the second half. Just sayin'.
