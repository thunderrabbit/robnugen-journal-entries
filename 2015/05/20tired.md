Usually after teaching in Fukuura, I go to Akihabara for Japanese
lesson.  Right now I'm headed home from Akihabara; the lesson started
without me 8 minutes ago.  tl;dr version is that I'm tired, but a few
little angelic hints have suggested I go home instead:

1. missed by seconds the connection in Yokohama and had to wait 10
minutes
2. missed by seconds the connection in Tokyo and had to wait 2 minutes
3. didn't have enough money on my Suica to exit in Akihabara.

It was upon this last hint that I was like hmmmm, and flipped a 10 yen
coin, thinking "10 = pay money and go to class ... building = go home
and sleeeeep"  it landed building face up so I'm headed home.

4. Also, my phone battery died, but I think that's more related to me
   being tired and not charging it when I had the chance.  Also
   related to being tired: I didn't bring the correct textbook to
   class today.  Fortunately, they had extras.

Okay sleeping now; hopefully I wake up at Kawasaki and not in wherever
this train is headed.

I woke up at the right time.
