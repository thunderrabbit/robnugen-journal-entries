In Harajuku now at a hat store.  We went to see art by Magritte which
was pretty cool and made me realize I'll never be a famous artist (if
I don't keep drawing things).  Then Sarupapa treated us to some cream
filled bread things which were pretty good though maybe not worth the
line in which we waited nor the price he paid. hrmm.
