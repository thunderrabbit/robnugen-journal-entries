Not that no one else has noticed, but we've had a few big earthquakes
in Japan recently, most recently at 8:34pm.  It felt like a 3 or 4 in
The Pink Cow, but it was a 5 out in the water.  Fortunately, it had a
depth of hundreds of miles, so no tsunami.

Crud I forgot to upload the image snagged from [jma earthquake map](http://www.jma.go.jp/en/quake/)

I've written another entry so the likelihood of my forgetting to
upload the image increases with every passing journal entry.

This makes me a bit more likely to get a phone with wifi and unlimited
data..

Oh dang I've heard they've done away with those plans at Softbank, so
certainly they're rare with other carriers as well.
