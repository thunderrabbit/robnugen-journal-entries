1. Golden week is this week. That means lots of time off.
1. Lin was involved in an accident a couple weeks ago. She's shrugged it off with flying colors save for the bruise on her leg.
1. She's been workin' lots recently.
1. I've just agreed to work each Tuesday with Sho on projects he's got going on
1. Might do some work for R at A in E, but not sure yet. Will talk to him tomorrow to see what he has in mind.
1. Have had one Skype lesson with Chieri, via Mutsumi. They are scheduled for Mondays.
1. Ted hasn't come back since he got out about a month ago.
1. I haven't been doing 100 pushups every day, but I've been considering it!
1. I have been working on pong; and recently added background music which increases in volume as game play progresses.  It's really neat!
1. Meeting Mutsumi and her husband + Bruno and his wife to see some art by Magritte today.  I thought she had misspelled Maglite at first (or is it Maglight?)
1. Weather is nice; I'm barefoot today.
1. Today there's apparently a big fight between two boxers.  I've heard of one of them.
