I'm writing this from my MBP.  The Dell crawled to molasses speed
after a bit, and I'm still optimistic that I won't have to powercycle
it.  It's still a bit responsive, so I just want to close some
programs and see if I can get it working again without shutting it
down completely.

The Dell is responding again, but I didn't need to merge anything in
git; I pushed from local MBP and then pulled, committed, and pushed on
Dell and now pulled on MBP, so I'm back to 95% thinking I'll have to
merge somewhere in the near future.  Somewhere?  sometime?
