Great lesson with GG tonight; after discussing customs related to
death in Japan (put money in the box so the person can cross The Styx,
but don't put coins cause they don't burn), we primarily reviewed
their homework on reported speech.  I had asked them to use reported
speech for a picture in their textbook, and they were great!  T had
the great idea of writing the original speech from which she created
the reported speech.  Nice!
