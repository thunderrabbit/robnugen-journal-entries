We are in Yakushiikekoen (sorry about romanji) chillin' under a wooden
roof thing that looks vaguely new like they might rebuild it every
couple of years.

Lin's enjoying Yumi's camera as they pose like apes in Yumi's natural
state.

We were originally scheduled to go to Kids Country, but when I saw the
hordes headed that direction, I suggested we might do that on a
different day, perhaps?  So glad they agreed!

At Yumi's parents' house, after yummy dinner, chillin' with Travis,
scoopin' up 4G wifi to show him /r/bitTippers and /r/getFairShare.

He showed me /r/thebutton, which I still have not pressed, and
probably won't.
