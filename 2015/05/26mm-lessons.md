Had lessons with both M & M tonight.  During both lessons I tried to
do more role play than I normally do with them.  They tend to veer
toward just checking homework instead of actually practicing English.
M had done a huge amount of homework (as she usually does), but I
didn't check it all tonight; I was like, "okay, let's practice this
part.."  (meet vs see)
