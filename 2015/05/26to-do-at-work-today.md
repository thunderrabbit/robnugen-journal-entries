1. ~~Figure out why proposed fix to 2613 ain't working (and fix it)~~
1. ~~meet with S and Y~~
1. ~~get new subdomains into DNS~~

Finished #1 above.  It turns out it was working, oops, nevermind.

## 15:39

actually #3 isn't done yet, but I've done as much as possible for now.
It's weird.  There's a website which exists at t.example.com but it's
not shown in the list of DNS records at the example.com registrar.  I
guess there's another list somewhere which tells what to do with
t.example.com.  I'll ask Alfonzo tomorrow if my d.example.com doesn't
work by this time tomorrow.

Funny: Y left cause he explained everything he needed to explain.
Then S was translating it for me and I was like, "well it works here"
and she checked and it worked for her too.  She went upstairs to ask
Y, but he was gone.  I go, "I bet he's at the conveni" so we went
there and saw Y or a guy who looks just like Y reading magazines.  I
got a drink and we headed back to find Y walking up the stairs ahead
of us.  Waitaminute, if that's Y, then who was that?  And where was Y
all this time?

It really was a location joke!
