Today we had a meeting that we should have held some time ago!  It was
the first of what I hope will be weekly meetings. なちゃん translated
and we got a lot done, including translating some things that I hadn't
had translated before so couldn't do the work!

Hopefully we'll be aable to chew through the backlog of tickets and
they'll be happy and I'll feel helpful/productive/happy yay!
