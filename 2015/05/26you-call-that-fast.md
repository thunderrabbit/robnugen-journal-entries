I went to the conveni (again), forgetting that my wallet is running on
fumes. Got to the register with a grand total of 233 yen worth of
chocolate and ピルクル.  I dumped out my change pocket into the tray
and discovered four coins, totaling 121 yen worth of change.

何ポイントがありますか？　"How many points are on my point card?"

百六十。"160"

じゃ、"Okay then.."  233 - 121 =  百十二ポイントで ".. 112 points."

ちょっと待って。"Just a moment."

He went and got a calculator to figure out how many points I'd need to
use.

As he came back, I repeated 百十二 twice, nicely in Japanese.  He
finally heard me and goes, 速いですね。  Um, not really, but thanks!
