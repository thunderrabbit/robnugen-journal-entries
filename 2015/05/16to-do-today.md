After that, things happened, including Jennie jumping out of Lin's
bicycle basket and running away before I could catch her.  We were
just on the front porch area testing her ability to chill in the
basket.  Test failed!  She did come back 2.5 hours later though, as I
suspected.  Lin arrived home before that time and was not impressed
with my tale!

She was impressed that Jennie has come back within 2 or 3 hours each
time I've let her out. "I'll think about it," she said, about the
possibility of giving Jennie some consistent outdoor time...
