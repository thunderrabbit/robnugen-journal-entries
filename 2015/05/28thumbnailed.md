Thumbnail creation summary:

    2365 thumbnails existed, and 4091 needed to be created
    Execution time: 998 s

Oh snap!  That was just for my /travel directory.

Showertime now; I'll let this thing run.

    8324 thumbnails existed, and 6788 needed to be created
    Execution time: 2789 s

## 7:09 next morning.

Wait what?  The second existence-total should include the first
existence-total, but the second numbers are cumulative.

I just ran it again:

    $ ./create_thumbs.pl ~/b.robnugen.com/
    15112 thumbnails existed, and 0 needed to be created
    Execution time: 36 s

Weird.
