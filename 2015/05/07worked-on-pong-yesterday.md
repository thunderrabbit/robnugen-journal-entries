Though it's buggy af, I added some more stuff to pong yesterday.
RIght now I'm super-late studying Japanese so I'm going to do that for
an hour before posting latest pong.

okay I just studied my anki cards for nearly 2 hours.

Yesterday I made a version of [pong with ai proof of concept](/samples/unity3d/pong/11-pong-with-ai-proof-of-concept/).

Moe joe.  I can't find any way to make unity joints visible during
game play. I'd like to do that because I have no idea if my proposed
spring joint is working at all.

I may try to put it on a slider joint.
