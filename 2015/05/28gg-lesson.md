Today before GG lesson, T asked A (in English) if she had read M's email.  A said
she had not.

I used this simple exchange as the basis for fully 45 minutes of
lesson:

    T: "Did you read M's email?"
    A: "No I didn't."

    R: "What did you ask her?"
    T: "I asked her if she had read M's email."
    R: "and what did she say?"
    T: "She said she hadn't."

(^_^)V

    R: "What did she ask you?"
    A: "She asked me if I had read M's email."
    R: "and what did you tell her?"
    A: "I told her I hadn't."

(^_^)V

Then, when M arrived, I asked her to ask T what she had asked A.

    M: "What did you ask A?"
    T: "I asked her if she had read your email."
    M: "What did she say?"
    T: "She said she hadn't."

(^_^)V

And then I had M ask A what she had been asked.

    M: "What did T ask you?"
    A: "She asked me if I had read your email."
    M: "What did you tell her?"
    A: "I told her I hadn't."

(^_^)V

And then we went a step deeper.

    R: "Sorry, M, what did you ask T?"
    M: "I asked her what she had asked A."

(^_^)V

    R: "T, what did M ask you?"
    T: "She asked me what I had asked A."

(^_^)V

    R: "A, what did M ask T?"
    A: "She asked what T had asked me."

(^_^)V

Then, while I was checking homework, M smartly asked T if she could
see her notebook (which I had just corrected).

    R: "What did you ask her?"
    M: "I asked her if she would show me her notebook."
    M: "I aksed her if I could see her notebook."
    M: "I asked for her notebook."
