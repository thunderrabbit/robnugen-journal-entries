Pushups with Friends inexplicably stopped counting after 1923 pushups
in one month, so I am writing my own.

[https://github.com/thunderrabbit/pushups-counter-js](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/pushups-counter-js)

No readme yet as of this writing, but it's backed by
[parse.com](http://www.parse.com)  It saves *each* pushup one by one,
but I want to add a local counter and then send them all up at once,
to save wear and tear on internets and on my parse budget (currently
$0).

Until I get that feature worked out, I shant link it directly, but you
can see it at /samples/javascript/pushup-counter-js/index.html on this
domain.  just don't tell anyone yet.  :-)

(actually there's a 70% chance I'll forget to incorporate it before I
upload everything and it might get overwritten.  I gotta jet to work
now so hopefully I remember later!)  later!
