Today in Japanese class we talked about family, and words for family
members.  I learned つま instead of おくさん for Lin, or even 内の上
（うちのかみ）

I wrote a nice letter to Lin based loosely on the format Ayako gave
us.

Spoke to Stefan after class; he and Yukiko were married yesterday, and
her birthday is tomorrow!  I'm getting over my crush on her; good
timing.

Right after I left, I realized I hadn't invited people to download
覚えろ but I didn't go back.  I can tell everyone on Wednesday.
