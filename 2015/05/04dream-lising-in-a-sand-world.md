<p class="dream">
Climbed up a light pole and found some eggs whihch were soft, but
viable bird eggs and I  placed some which were above a line down below
the line just to do it, and while I was there, one of them started to
hatch.  A little video game bird came out and was attracted to the
video screen.  I realized it was a simlation of sort, the bird was
attracted to the sceand the scene itself was changing through a
different rndomzider.  I enterd the scene as well and found some
points where I should dig being highlighted by slightly jumping upward
like a  quite simple but obvious "pick me" or "dig here" so I went to
the spots in turn and founa bunch of idential keys with non-identical
clues as to where the lock was for the keys.  I din't read them, but
started to put the caches back away in the sand and one of them
wouldn't quite go back down into its hole, and then a guy came up
behind us and announced "everyone, I opened the ceiling to my room and
it got filled with sand" and I expected him to say 'so don't do that"
but he continued, "and everyone has been nominated to help clean up.
Johnson, Steve, Rabbit, Cindy, all of you come in her and help"

and then Lin came in to wake me up.
