Crud.

I forgot to consider the chipset when getting my wifi USB thing.  I
can't figure out how to make Debian use it.

The Dell is essentially not useable for me as a work computer without
wifi unless I string a network cable from our living room to my desk,
which I don't think Lin would like because I can't do it in a way that
will allow the doors to close (without damaging the house).

Anyway, I tried to reinstall Debian to have it "self detect" the USB
wifi, but it still didn't seem to work, AND it kept failing at the
install step which added the environment (e.g. KDE, Gnome, default) I
tried various combinations, including just doing the defaults, but it
still failed and I couldn't find a log of the error.

Anyway, anyway, I'm going to try Linux Mint installation.  If this
doesn't work with wifi card, I'll consider buying a new card as well
as scheduling a time to meet Travis who offered to support my Debian
experience.
