I just finished Mike's latest book, *The Last*.  It's a really
interesting story set in the real world, just three years from now.
Quite an easy read except for the queasy parts which I almost had to
put down!  The story leaves some unanswered questions, and lends
itself to more books, which I hope he writes soon!

I was surprised by the plot twists; it seemed so simple at first!
Interesting to wonder what I would do if I found myself in the main
character's situation: the last man alive in a city full of zombies!!

The story is not as complex as Mike's other work, and focuses on just
a couple main characters (not counting the rarely-distinguishable
zombies of course!)  It's primarily written in first person, and what
a ride!

Looking forward to the world more fleshed out; hopefully the series
will be a detailed mega-thriller!
