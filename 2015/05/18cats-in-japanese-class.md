Tonight in Japanese class, Tsun sat next to me as Fiona and Melanie
had just joined my table.  I had forgotten his name, but I remember it
now!

Fiona drew two cats on as many pieces of paper.  The styles were quite
different so I asked if she could some more for my friend of friend.
Let's hope good connections are made!
