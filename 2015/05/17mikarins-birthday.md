Headed home from Mikarin's birthday party.  Lin's driving her uncle's
minivan with me, her mom, aunt, and uncle.

Mikarin played a nice song on piano and then was 
like, 自分で作りました、"I wrote it." Wow!  I wonder if she can/should
copyright it.

She and Takun did a magic show for us, including a couple tricks I
wasn't able to figure out.

Takun tried one trick that *he* wasn't able to figure out; the die
kept showing the same number.  Afterward I tried to explain that he
should hold the thing like *this* and not like *that*, but I'm not
sure if he got it.
