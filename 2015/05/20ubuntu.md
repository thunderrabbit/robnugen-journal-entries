## 20:49 Wednesday 20 May 2015 JST

At home now after having purchased a pack of ten DVD-RW disks so I can
overwrite OS X with Ubuntu.  Disk is being burned now.

## later

The disk worked fine on the Dell box, but would not boot on my MacBook
Pro.  Fuck that.

## 17:23pm next day

(I need a quick command key to fill in the date!!)

I'm headed to my GG class, which happens to be in Akihabara.

Though the DVD boots on the Dell, the Dell has no hard drive. So I've
got it in my backpack and plan to ask a guy in the shop I went to last
week "hey man, can you put a hard drive in this thing?"

I looked online for a video showing how to replace the HD on this
model laptop but the video is totally different than my laptop.  bah.

It looks like I'll need to pry out the ram to get to the HD cause I
don't see any other easily accessible HD sized slots.

The puter is old so I'll probably just go for like 100GB or something
small-ish かな。。。 depends on price (and everything else of course).

Ended up getting a 750GB 5400 rpm drive with a 5 year warranty. Not
bad for 6000 yen.  I'm on the train now, but I'll hopefully have
Ubuntu installed on the drive by the end of tonight.
