Headed home from GG lesson in Akihabara. Today we ended up with 7
pages of notes.  And, today was the first time they invited me to ride
the train home with them. Nice! Same line so it's convenient.  I ended
up telling them about KTRU and how much fun it was to DJ there back in
the day.  I have several tapes recorded from my shows; I wonder about
the legality of putting them on soundcloud or something.

Probably illegal; we certainly wouldn't want to promote some
relatively obscure artist, now would we, FCC?

Walking to the station, I spoke to M about journaling, saying the she
should just keep going with old journals and not equate a lapse with
tossing the old journal.
