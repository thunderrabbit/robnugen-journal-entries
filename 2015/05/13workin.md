## 13:35 Wednesday 13 May 2015 JST

Today for CB I did 1/3 of a ticket which I split into 3 tickets,
primarily because they reference different websites, one of which
isn't even in the same repo.

I'll do the second ticket soon, and may have to ask Andrew for help on
the third.

On the train now after having finished my lesson in Fukuura. I have
alternating classes in that timeslot and I expected (and prepared for)
one class, but the other class came because they had no lesson during
Golden Week.

Fair enough! I winged a lesson and overheard one guy saying he had had
fun. Great!
