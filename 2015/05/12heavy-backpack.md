Our office space is being reduced from 4 desks to 2, so three old
computers were being tossed.  I grabbed two of them (Dell Precision
M4500, its power supply, bluetooth mouse, its power supply, and white
plastic Macbook), so now have three laptops in my backpack.  Supa
heavy!  I plan to put Ubuntu on one or both of them.

The Dell boots fine into Windows, so I downloaded latest Ubuntu and
plan to toss it onto my usb keychain and wipe the disk then install
Ubuntu and play with encrypted partitions and such.  This begins my
adventure away from buying any more Mac hardware.  I'll put Unity on
the Dell and try to do all my Unity dev there.

The Macbook didn't boot, but I didn't have a power supply for it; I'm
sure I have one at home though; we'll see what's on there and probably
give it an Ubuntu makeover as well!

Looks like Lin wants the Dell.  She's such a windows fangirl.
