Sigh.

I received an old MacBook on which I'd like to install Ubuntu.  Even
upon writing the Ubuntu image file to my usb drive; I got an error
message like "this disk cannot be read."  After a bit of searching, it
appears that Apple is trying to disallow people from installing Ubuntu
over OS X.

Bah.

So the suggestion is to burn the Ubuntu iso onto a CD and boot from
that.  But what about newer Macs with no external drive?
