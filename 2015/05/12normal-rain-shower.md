It's raining a bit tonight.  They're calling it a "typhoon" for some
reason.  I'm like >_>  ...  where?


There are no garbage cans blowing across the street; no tree branches
destroying houses; no power outage anywhere... You call this a
storm???

Okay okay so the wind blew the rain cover off my bag (twice) and
destroyed my umbrella.
