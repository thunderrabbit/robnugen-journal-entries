I'm pretty sure this is the third year I've hugged Amma, or she hugged
me, I guess.  Last year I received a mantra from her, and I confirmed
I remembered it (almost) correctly.  I had one vowel slightly off (and
all the other things that are lost in the translation from Sanskrit to
English).

I've got a ticket labeled J-2, along with probably 50 other people,
though I don't honestly know how many tickets there are per
letter-number combination.  They're on G-2 now.

There are some kids playing hide and seek.  10 year old boy stood just
behind 9 year old girl while she was counting, so when she turned
around, he was immediately tagged and started counting.  Kinda tough
when they only have a single room with one or two hiding spots (though
there are some large structural columns, it's hard to hide "behind"
them with all sides open.
