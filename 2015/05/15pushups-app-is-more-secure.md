Okay, now my pushup counter uses Parse's suggested code for logging in
and saving data per user.

So, please feel free to enjoy my
[pushups counter!](https://new.robnugen.com/samples/javascript/pushups-counter-js/index.html)

Just click login to test it, or create your own username and password
to track your own pushups!

Right now, all pushups are saved after clicking save, but the total
number of pushups is not displayed.  I'll get to that soon.  But
first, pushups, shower, and sleep.
