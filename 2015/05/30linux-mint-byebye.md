Linux Mint seemed to restrictive in its options. But I guess the worst
part: I couldn't figure out how to open an application without using
my mouse.  I could press the alt button once, then type the name of
the app and see its icon, but not actually activate it.

I like how Debian will activate the app if I press the enter key.

Debian is reinstalled on the new old Dell; I'm going to try again to
buy a usb nano wifi dongle so I can use the computer at my desk.
