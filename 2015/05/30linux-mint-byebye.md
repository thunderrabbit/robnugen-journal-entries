Cinnamon, used by default in Linux Mint, seemed too restrictive in its
options. But I guess the worst part: I couldn't figure out how to open
an application without using my mouse.  I could press the alt button
once, then type the name of the app and see its icon, but not actually
activate it.

I like how Gnome (Classic), installed by default with my current
Debian install disk, will activate the app if I press the enter key.

So, Debian (with Gnome Classic) is reinstalled on the new old Dell;
I'm going to try again to buy a usb nano wifi dongle so I can use the
computer at my desk.

Edited Friday 5 June 2015: to more accurately reflect my complaints
against the window *manager*, not the OS.  Original is
