Yesterday I paid for my tickets to Perth!  Now I need to get my
visa.

There were a couple of errors on AB yesterday, but I haven't changed
anything recently, so I guess it's a part of the system people don't
use very often!  I didn't do a git blame to figure out when it
happened, but the fix was easy: specify which table to use for a
particular field.  I guess it would be smart to do that by default.

Tariq and I released the first version of
[Pongdemonium](http://com759.wix.com/chatforestgames)!  I immediately
see that it needs levels and varied gameplay to get any traction.

To do today:

1. ~~teach extra lesson in Ebisu~~
1. ~~[Broadcast my walk across Ebisu station](https://twitter.com/thunderrabbit/status/636683844331048960)~~
1. get OZ visa
1. work on poppopchaos or pongdemonium
1. meet Satomi for CB
1. teach extra lesson in Shinagawa
1. teach normal lesson in Akihabara
