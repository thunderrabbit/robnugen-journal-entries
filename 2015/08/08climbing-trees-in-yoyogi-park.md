Satomi said her friend Kenji liked to climb trees so we should all do
so!  Today was the day; we met in Yoyogi Park at 4pm.  At first it was
Satomi and Zakky, and then I showed up and we went into Yoyogi.  Kenji
and his wife Sherry (sp) came as well, and their friend Ozan lives
nearby so joined the fun. He said he wasn't good at climbing trees,
but we had fun playing badmitton and throwing a hard tennis ball at
velcro mitts.

After trees were climbed, we sat next to the pond, and after that,
Satomi and Zakky had to split so the rest of us went to an Italian
eatery near Ozan and Sachiko's place.  Sachiko joined during dinner
and showed us pics of the stuffed rabbit she's making for a project!
I introduced Francois and got a pic of him with Kenji and Sherry
(along with her squirrel-skin iphone cover).  Nice!
