Yesterday I released a big update to
[Pop Pop Chaos](http://www.poppopchaos.com/); now people can see lots
of pretty bubbles!  This is all thanks to [d3](http://d3js.org/),
which uses SVG, designed by W3C in 1999.

Unfortunately, at this point the game does *not* work for mobile
users.  You can press the buttons button on mobile to go back to the
old school buttons.
