At the toy store I found a take-apart puzzle featuring two loosely
linked nails bent into trianglish G shapes.  They are loosely linked,
but they're hard as nails, and I cannot seem to get them separated.
Seriously, it looks like they've been mis-created (with automation, is
that even possible??) or somehow "forced" into an unsolvable state.
But they are so hard, I can't seem to force them back.

I took a picture of a solvable version and an unsolvable version, so
get ready to see those images online within the next 1000 years when I
think about it, have time, *and* have internet access to post them.
