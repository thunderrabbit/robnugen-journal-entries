The [Zebra Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle) features brand names of unhealthy products, so I
changed them into less-unhealthy food items.  I haven't tried to solve it yet, but here's my tweaked version:

1. There are five houses, nationalities, pets, favorite foods, and favorite drinks:
2. The Englishman lives in the red house.
3. The Spaniard owns the dog.
4. Coffee is drunk in the green house.
5. The Ukrainian drinks tea.
6. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
7. The burrito lover owns snails.
8. Hamburgers are preferred in the yellow house.
9. Milk is drunk in the middle house.
0. The Norwegian lives in the first house.
1. The man who loves dessert lives in the house next to the man with the fox.
2. Hamburgers are favorite in the house next to the house where the horse is kept.
3. The salad lover drinks orange juice.
4. The Japanese loves raw fish.
5. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.

Now, who drinks water? Who owns the zebra?
