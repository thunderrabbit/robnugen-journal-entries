I changed my life in 1997 by attending a weekend men's retreat organized by https://mkp.org/ My ability to understand myself and my emotions / motivations grew exponentially from there. I'm by no means an expert, but I'm much better able to listen to others, and express myself.... though not in this post, apparently!!

Anyway, I have missed the energy of this organization since moving to Japan, and recently decided to get involved again. I'm heading to Perth in October(*) with the hopes that it will rekindle the fire of authentic ROB within me!

(*) 95% confirmed. :-)
