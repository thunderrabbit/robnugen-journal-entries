Made some updates on demo3 of the CB site with Satomi.

Today she told me she has an old iMac that will show the Apple icon,
but won't otherwise boot.  I suggested we have a party to take it
apart and see if we can fix it!

I'm guessing just the hard drive is fooked so replacing that might fix
it... かな。。
