Actually, her name is Francine, so "Cine" is pronounced "seen" as an
easier option for Japanese speakers to say than フランシーン.

We just finished lessons in Fukuura for JB.  Chris was supposed to
teach, but he's apparently not fully back from vacation haha.

Francine seems to always have creative fun lessons for her classes.
Plus she just went through Berlitz training and said she learned a
lot.  Nice!
