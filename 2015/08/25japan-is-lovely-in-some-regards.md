I bought a carton of peach tea and a carton of milk tea.  I drank the
milk tea and left peach tea on the table, in public, but out of sight
of the shop staff.

Two+ hours later, I came back and it was still on the table.

I mean, it's not like Grand Central, but there's a fair stream of
people who come through here.  Thank you, Japanese culture; I
appreciate you leaving my tea for me.
