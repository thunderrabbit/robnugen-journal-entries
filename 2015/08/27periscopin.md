Periscope is a pretty neat thing, and hopefully a step in the right
direction.  I once said we will be in the future if at any moment,
without really "doing" anything, I can live chat with my brother or
anyone I like.

Periscope is live, but it's not my brother on the other end; it's not
two-way, and I have to get out my phone, but dang if it's not live
video.
