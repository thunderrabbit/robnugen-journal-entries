The live md5 count thing has been languishing for a while, so I bribed
peeps on bittippers to see if anyone would be interested.  One guy
added one string to the list, and then another guy and I added strings
from 127 to 140 in a little less than two hours. Nice!

He said it was an interesting puzzle for him because he's into cryptography.
Perfect!

Funny: he also wrote a little cheater in Perl to search for strings.
His included just a counter inside a string, so I added a counter to
my md5 count cheater as well.  It makes for really short strings!
