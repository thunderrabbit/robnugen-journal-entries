Two years ago I decided I would make a meditation time for iOS so I
could inspire myself to meditate daily.  It took ten days (according
to git) and had all the features I needed: set the desired countdown
time, count down, then count *up* after the time had finished!

That way, if I was having a good meditation, I could keep going *and
know how long I continued*!!  Genius!

Super excited, also because it was open source, I submitted my
fantastic project to Apple.

It was summarily rejected as being too simple.

So, recently, I decided to rewrite it in Unity.  Work on that project
spans 10 hours, according to git, but I never really finished the
project, and definitely didn't get it working on my phone.

Today, I decided to do it as a static site.  With Middleman.
Fortunately, `middleman init` failed.  After that, fortunately,
`pelican-quickstart` failed as well.  I say fortunately, because,
quite obviously to me now, all that extra crap was just crap.

I only have a little bit of extra crap now with my new meditation timer:

[瞑想頑張れ](http://thunderrabbit.github.io/meisogambare/)

Source code is available on both Bitbucket and Github (because I couldn't get
thunderrabbit.bitbucket.org/meisogambare to work)

Weird. I see now that my description is labeled "Status" instead of
"Description", or rolled into the About.

Anyway, yay!  Only 200 minutes to finish today, which included a lot
of web surfing and doing 100 pushups!
