Workin' late with Sho on a new site for Body and Soul; they put on an
event each year in May so we're prepping for the announcement.

I put their original site in a git repo and have their banner page on
the master branch, but edits to the new site were started from a few
commits back.  Blarg.  I agree with my decisison to start edits from a
few commits back, but maybe I should have two "master" branches: one
master-banner and one master-site, or something.  Then each master
would have far fewer changes and no weird merges required.

I might abandon the existing master branch and just pretend it's not
there and move forward with two master-_____ branches plan.
