Seat Lottery is the game I like to play on the trains.  If there are
no seats available, size up the passengers to see who is most likely
to get off the train first.  Demographics, fashion, activity, and
posture each play a role.

The person to my left will get off in Shibuya or possibly before
Shibuya.  I have made an imaginary bet of $500 that she'll get off the
train before I get off in Harajuku.
