###There are probably errors in the Japanese notes below!

I'm doing a couple things with this entry

1. testing "all Japanese" titles in my journal
2. acknowledging [textfugu's Japanese the hard way](http://www.textfugu.com/season-1/hard-way/)
3. starting learning Japanese log
4. tweaking my journal tools a bit (maybe)

number 1 above will be done when I upload this.

Below are numbers 2 and 3:

Yesterday I rediscovered [Habit RPG](https://habitrpg.com/) which
Travis first told me about, and I added 10 "do ten pushups" and 4
"study Japanese 15 minutes" in my dailies section.

(I did 100 pushups on the day before yesterday, did 100 yesterday, and
have done 90 so far today.)

Yesterday I did two 15 minute study periods using
[memrise JLPT 4 flashcards](http://www.memrise.com/course/584/jlpt-n4-vocab/).
Today I did an hour of those and
[Meet The Parents 1](http://www.japanesepod101.com/2008/07/08/beginner-lesson-1-nihongo-dojo-meet-the-parents/)
on JapanesePod101, and just now (in the middle of writing the
sentence, did 20
[prefecture cards](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2465637515) using
Anki.

I'm still in English-Japanese phase of study (and I wonder if I
recommend English-English study to my students too soon).

Here are things I studied which I remember offhand (from having studied as much as two
hours ago)

1. 方 (かた) - thing, honorable person
1. 君　(きみ) - you
1. 君　(くん) - suffix for boy's names (I didn't know the kanji was same as きみ
1. 御座います　(ございます) - thanks
1. 代わり　(かわり) - change?
1. 掛ける　(かける) - sit down; start but not finish; pour water; (and more)
1. 込む　(こむ) - go in
1. 空く　(すく) - become less crowded
1. 栃木県　(とちぎけん) - I forgot where it's located, but I can nearly　read it now.
1. 鳥取県　(とっとりけん) - on north coast of 本州 above 四国

More more more but I am tired / don't remember.
