###There are probably errors in the Japanese notes below!

Signed up for Wanikani and learned the first 10 radicals they suggest.

Can't type one of them, but here are 9 and the English names suggested
by Wanikani (and many other places (in most cases?)):

1. 、  drop
1. 七  seven
1. ノ  slide
1. 亠  lid
1. 人  person
1. ト  toe
1. 力  power
1. 口  mouth
1. 日  sun
