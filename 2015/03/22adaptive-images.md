I just came across a beautiful solution to resizing images on my
site.  It allows me to keep my existing images' filenames, and it just
works as a drop-in solution.  A single PHP file (plus a few lines of
.htaccess to point images through it).  The resulting image URLs are
unchanged, but the size of the image is adapted per the device size.

90% chance I will send some btc to the developer

50% chance I will start putting my images on a site that uses this new
tech.

20% chance I will dig through some of the modifications in the *many*
forks and pull some of them in.

But right now it's shower + bedtime.
