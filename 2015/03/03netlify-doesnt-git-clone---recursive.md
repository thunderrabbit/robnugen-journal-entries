I got my repos sorted today; all the journal entries have had
frontmatter lobotomies if Middleman can't deal with the different
dates, and my main Middleman repo includes the journal entry repo as a
submodule.

However, turns out netlify doesn't clone recursively (yet).  I
mentioned this to Mathias and he was like, "hmm you're right" and said
he would look into it.  But, he said politely, he was planning to go
home for the night and didn't want to push any possibly-breaking
changes before going to bed.

HAHhahaa most def.  We'll see if they get it sorted out soon!  Then
I'll have a temporary space for journals before I figure out how
Middleman does deploys natively, decide what URL to use (hakyll?  but
it's not Hakyll anymore... hmmm), and set it all up.

Maybe I'll go with new.robnugen.com until it's a site that can take
over for all the crap on robnugen.com now (fat chance?) then kill
robnugen.com as I switch new.robnugen.com to www.robnugen.com.  Damn
what a lot of <del>broken links</del> <ins>redirects</ins> I have
planned!
