I took a few pictures of some old buildings and an empty lot, all of
which will soon apparently become a construction site.

This is between 京急 and シーサイド lines respective 金沢八景stations,
an area that's been undeveloped for quite some years!  I can remember
coming here about 11 years ago with someone Frank's NOVA classes.  She
taught me the phrase まじで？  And the same night we heard someone use
it.  Yes, really!

Anyway, I liked that it had been neglected, featuring a fence loaded
with discarded umbrellas and some old construction signs succumbing to
the grass.

I guess those days are over!
