Mail.app wouldn't respond after Finder.app isn't loading.  I forced
relaunch of Finder, but it hasn't relaunched yet.

Here's what I wrote to Apple when the dialog said "oh you killed Mail app; do you
want to report it?"

    Finder won’t start.
    
    I don’t know if that’s affecting Mail, but I had to kill finder
    because its one (1) single window couldn’t display ten (10) ten
    little (less than 1MB each) images.  It just hangs with a blank
    white page and spinning icon.  I can see the images with terminal;
    I can see them with emacs.  I can see them with Cyberduck.  But
    not Finder.
    
    Why can’t I see them with Finder? 
    
    I’ll stop here, but I swear on my million times I’ve yelled at my
    computer I will never buy Apple gear again.


Funnily enough, I discovered I couldn't use Finder while I was trying
to upload a new icon to itunesconnect for our latest app.

Right now the `top` command is using the most CPU, at 10%.

Chrome is now locked up while trying to quick-look an image that I
think is the correct one I need to upload.

Hahah the clock in the top bar of OSX has stopped at 9:59:28.

So basically, the only things that are working correctly for me right
now are *not* Apple software: Emacs, iTerm (not Terminal), Hugo..

And it shows me that I have spent 30 minutes
trying/wanting/bitching-about-not-being-able to upload the image to
itunes connect.  Thanks Apple.
