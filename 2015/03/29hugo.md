## 00:11 Sunday 29 March 2015 JST

So I'm looking at [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as possibly replacing Middleman.

To do so, I have to change the date format in frontmatter from
something like `2015-03-28 10:55 JST` to something like
`2015-03-29T00:11:18+09:00`.

Hopefully the new format will work with Middleman so I can use it in
current entries until I can convert the dates in all the previous
entries.
