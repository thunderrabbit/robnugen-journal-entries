Actually I don't know if she'll be here, but one of my former students
at Nova contacted me on FB saying that she's in the Tuesday version of
my Thursday class with GG.  Well, I'm teaching the Tuesday lesson
today at 12, so I may see her soon!  I don't honestly remember her
just from FB photo, but we'll see if some memories return after
actually chatting with her.

She didn't join.  :-(

But we had a fun lesson!  Basically asked and answered a few
questions, while correcting grammar and such.
