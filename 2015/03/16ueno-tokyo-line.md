Starting 14 March the Tokaido line trains which used to terminate in
Tokyo now go on to stations up to like 2 hours north of Tokyo.

So now it looks like we can go from Ito to Ino on a single train.
Where the heck is Ino?  Iono, but it's up there somewhere.

Hilariously, while writing about the new line, I saw some shops and
such that looked like Akihabara, "hmm! but that's the other direction
from the way I'm going.."

"Next station: Ueno."

Aw man, I went the wrong way on the Tokaido line from Tokyo station.
