Finished lesson; 'twas fine and interesting topic about Paul Allen's
team recently finding Battleship Musashi.

Finished the lesson and outside the station I saw two women looking at
the local area map.  I wasn't able to help them as quickly as they
helped themselves (by finding their target on the map before I did)
but I was most depressed that I don't know French.
