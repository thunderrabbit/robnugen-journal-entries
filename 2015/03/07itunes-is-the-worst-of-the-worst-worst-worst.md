Not sure how many times I have said this.

For no apparent reason, I can't select the specific set of icons I
want to use for my app.

So I told it "no icons" and then told it "use icons" and selected the
set I created.  Click "migrate" (the only option) and it creates a new
*empty* set of icons next to those which I already created.

That's bad enough.  I say "use this" and it creates a new empty set
instead of using what I want.

But now I can't even find a way to copy the icons from one to the
other without starting the fuck over from fucking Finder, and don't
get me started on fucking slow as fuck Finder.
