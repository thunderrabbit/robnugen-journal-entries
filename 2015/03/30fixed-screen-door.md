When we got our cats last year, I replaced the thin, easily-ripped
screen on the sliding door with a somewhat sturdier stainless steel
screen.

After the cats ascended the screen a few times, leaving claw-sized
sags, they realized the could just ram through the bottom corner, so
they did.

I deliberated for a long time how to replace it with something even
sturdier, and have not yet found a solution.  Even so, Lin was like
"yeah, if you could fix the screen, that'd be great."

I was able to reuse the existing screen just be turning it upside
down.  And actually it seems like it will work pretty well.
