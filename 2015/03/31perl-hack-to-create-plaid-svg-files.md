Mutsumi asked if I can make some .svg files for her husband.  I tried
Artboard, Inkscape and some online things, but none are quite as fast
as just spitting out xml via [SVG module](http://search.cpan.org/~szabgab/SVG-2.63/lib/SVG.pm).

Code is on github
[svg-fabric](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/svg-fabric).
