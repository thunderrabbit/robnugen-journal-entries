I just walked through Harajuku, along Yoyogi Park, then through the
web of streets near Center Street (which has been renamed, but to what,
I've forgotten), across Shibuya Scramble and am now on Yamanote Line
headed home.

One shop piqued my interest (besides the place where I sometimes get
chicken-pita sandwiches): My Free Bit, I think it was called.  Android
phones and branding of light blue on white background.  What's free?
Bits?  bitcoin?  phones?  hmmm.
