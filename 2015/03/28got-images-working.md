I created a sample repo to show
[middleman+markdown not rendering with spaces image names with spaces](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/middleman-with-spaces-in-filenames).

I had very few such spacey filenames, so I just renamed them.

Middleman 4 is coming out soon, so maybe it will be fixed then.
