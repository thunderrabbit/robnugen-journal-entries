Wow first entry in March.  I wonder why, but it seems I often miss the first day(s) of months.

Worked on stuff for Nate yesterday on new redmine installation, makin'
it all customized and nearly getting emails working.  The server can
send them from command line, and Redmine says its email is set up, but
maybe it doesn't check past "is there a configuration file" (i.e. I
set it up rhong)

I've been studying a bit of Japanese (kanji) with the app
[Japanese](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/japanese/id290664053?mt=8).
