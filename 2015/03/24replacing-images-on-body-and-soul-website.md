Headed in to sbstrm now to replace some images on the new Body and
Soul website.  Sho said there were more than he expected, but I expect
I can finish them all in 4 hours before I have to leave for Mutsumi's
lesson.

5:55 pm suddenly arrived and I was like oh fuck and ran out the door
to go to the toy store on the way to Muchan's lesson.  It's Shibata's
last Tuesday there, so I definitely wanted to say bye and thanks to
her.

They taunted me with a puzzle called Quatro Formagio (with the "form"
because the goal is to form a square pattern with wedge shapped
pieces).. I wasn't able to solve it in the time I had available.
Boooo.

Shibata emailed me tonight and was like, "let's do language exchange
via email" and "I can tell you the answer to the puzzle" hahahahah.
Definitely no to the puzzle hint; not sure about language exchange.
