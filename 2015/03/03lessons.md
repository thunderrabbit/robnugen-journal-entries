Yoshie may introduce a friend for lessons with me.  Yay!

Mutsumi recently asked if I could create a vector pattern, and I spent
some time looking at
[weaving software](http://weaving-tool.appspot.com/maker/)
[packages](www.weavemaker.com/downloads/)... but it appears that it
will require more conventional image software..  I plan to use
[Artboard](http://www.mapdiva.com/products-page/), which I've had for
a while but not really used (nor registered).  This project would give
me an excuse to do both!
