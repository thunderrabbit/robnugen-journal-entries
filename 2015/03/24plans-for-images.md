Okay, so my basic plan is to move all my images to b.robnugen.com and
hopefully be able to keep the existing links to
/?images/path/to/image.png working in my journal pages.

There are several old images on Flickr (which are still there! (oh so
happy thank you Flickr!!))... I plan to move them to b.robnugen.com as
well.

I'm not sure if I can easily handle redirecting old links to images,
but I guess if I can tell robnugen.com/image.... links to refresh to
b.robnugen.com/image.... that will solve it.

Thing is; I'm not sure if/how Dreamhost's manipulation of www before
robnugen.com will interfere with my plan to snag ...  well I guess I
can just look for www.robnugen.com/image OR robnugen.com/image and
point them both to b.robnugen.com/image

I'll let
[Adaptive-Images](https://github.com/MattWilcox/Adaptive-Images) deal
with serving images from that subdomain and then evvveryone will be
happy, including mobile users.
