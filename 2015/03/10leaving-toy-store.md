Using my new verb 手伝う, I asked Shibata if there was anything I
could do to help around the store.  She was like, "really?" and I go
yeah! and ended up helping her make an image of a ship using stackable
soft-plastic building blocks.

Shibata said she is leaving the toy store soon. Boooo.  She's gonna
work somewhere in Tachikawa, so soon it'll be さよなら time.
