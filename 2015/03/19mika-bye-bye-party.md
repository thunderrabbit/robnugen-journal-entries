On the train now after hanging out with Mika and Kai for nearly 3
hours around Tokyo station.  French restaurant Gabo and then Mary's
(chocolate) Cafe where customers can self-serve white chocolate
shavings on drinks!

Mika is moving to a new company, so this was our bye-bye party for
her.  We talked about their kanji, which I forgot, and Lin's kanji,
which I remember.  Kai showed pictures of their trip to Europe and we
compared our experiences in Paris; Kai saw Versaille, which sounds
really big and beautiful!

In the cafe, conversation was less tangible; what do you believe
happens after we die? what do you want to be next lifetime? and I
mentioned David's statement "the spirit world is real," which he told
us after doing a retreat (featuring ayahuasca) in Peru.
