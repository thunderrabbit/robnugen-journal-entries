Chapters with Muchan and Muchan were great tonight; Mucchan has been
working hard on his stuff and Muchan always works hard so it's
lovely.  Sarupapa joined Muchan and explained some of the requirements
for his fabric designs.  I'm actually writing with the design in front
of my screen now so I can only see part of what I'm typing.  Hmm maybe
I will use this as the first chance to take a photo that will be only
available on b.robnugen.com and not have already been available
elsewhere.

I'm a bit tired so that sentence didn't make as much asnse as I
planned.

Dang my phone locks up a lot after I take photos.  Why?  Why does iOS
suck so much?  I take the photo, thn click the view photo button and
the screen goes fuzzy and locks up until the phone boots after about a
minutes.  Swear to Jeebuz I'm never buying Apple hardware again.

Sarupapa took us out to dinner after the lesson and I'm headed home
now.
