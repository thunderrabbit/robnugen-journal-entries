I evaluated [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) now that
it's free and its pricing model is quite nice!  They require no
payment until we start making money consistently.

However, the dearth of assets and such impels me to stay with [Unity3D]().

right now I'm doing this little
[pong tutorial](http://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-pong-game) which is
geared toward Unity3D version 5.

Code is done and on github, but no live version (yet???) [pong via noobtuts](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/unity-pong-via-noob-tuts)
