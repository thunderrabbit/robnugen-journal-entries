Hmmm.  Last night the idea of presenting at Pecha Kucha came to mind.
Could be a good place to speak about authenticity

Some fragments came to mind while walking to the station

* I like walking barefoot   (on beach)
* Not just on the beach but everwhere I can (collage of barefeet walking)
* Don't worry about what people think
* Just be happy
* Not always happy
* Sometimes life can be surprising   (surprise snake)
* What if we could talk about it?
* Not to a mirror, but to a person who listens
* What if we take time to sit and just be  (black screen)
* Sometimes we might find monsters
* but it turns out they're just unheard sadness
* I broke my shoulder             (x-ray picture)
* Had just meditated so wasn't bothered
* I lost my rabbit       (Francois picture)
* found him all cleaned up and repaired on Ebay!
* Life's little mysteries   (factory production line thousand copies Francois)
* Sometimes people fight like this (not listening picture)
* I'm afraid.  scared to come up here.
* Can I tell you that?  Can I be honest with you?
* Will you still like me?   Still listen to me?
* My pessimistic side says you won't.  I'll be booed off stage and I'm doing it wrong and no one will understand and it will just be terrrible
* But I can't control other people's responses.  More important question: 
* Will I still like myself?
* You know when you walk barefoot outside in the city and you step on a piece of glass and you have to ask your wife to dig in there with a needle to pull it out, and you're just lying there feeling helpless with a needle near a sensitive part of your body? I mean the feet!
* Probably not.  That's why I encourage people to use "I-statements."
* Sometimes, when I walk outside in Tokyo, I step on a piece of glass and can feel it lodged in my foot.  I limp for the rest of the day and then ask my wife to dig in there with a needle to pull it out.  
* But I don't feel helpless, because I trust her.
* Can I trust her with my soul?  Sure; it's eternal. What about my feelings and emotions?  Uh oh!  Scary!
