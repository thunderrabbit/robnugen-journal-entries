Reason number 8,147 to hate apple:

Lin bought some credit on itunes store.  I added it to her phone,
intrigued by how the camera can find the letters on the back of the
card even while I rotated it while it tried to scan.

So she wanted to make a purchase...  And have to verify her account.
Not just with password, but with two (2) personal questions.  "Where
did you first pet a monkey?" and "What was your first Butthole Surfers
album?" or something.

Lin doesn't remember the answers to the questions, so I pressed the
link that says "I forgot".

That interface doesn't work.  When I enter her email address, it
autostupidly goes to the iforgot.apple.com and won't let me enter the
password.

God I hate apple.
