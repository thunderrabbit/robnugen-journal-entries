Booooo.

I had used my MOOV on the way to the toy store, but noticed it missing
when I got back to Kawasaki.  It may have fallen off when I took off my
shoes after the lesson.  I'm optimistic I'll get it back!


### email to MOOV customer support:

    I'm so sad!  I wonder if you have a perk like 1-free-replacement-
    MOOV-to-those-who-bought-2-MOOVs-during-preorder-a-long-time-ago-
	and-lost-one-recently
    
    In my mind, I've designed a kick-ass HEY_MOOV_DONT_MOVE wrapper to
	keep my MOOV from moving too far.
    
    It will enclose the MOOV so even if it slips from the rubber
	bracelet, it will be snuggly kept inside a little cloth wrapper.
    
    Can I at least get the preorder price again to replace my lost MOOV?
    
      xoxoxo
