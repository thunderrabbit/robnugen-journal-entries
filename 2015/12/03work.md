Today I went to sb to work on CB, but S didn't show up, so I worked on
AB instead.  AB„ÅÆS called me all "hey do you know why this number says
this but that number says that?"

Um.

Well, no I don't, and it is a bug, but it doesn't keep you from doing
your job and doesn't require a phone call so you can keep me from
doing my job.
