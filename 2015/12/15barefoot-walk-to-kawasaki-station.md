I'm barefoot today because I don't have to wear shoes until 6:30pm.  A
guy hung up his phone to talk to me a bit after he was like, "hey are
you okay?"

He used to be a kickboxer and now has a bar in Roppongi.  I didn't get
the deets but maybe I'll see him when I head out to The Pink Cow this
week.  He was like, "why is everybody talking about The Pink Cow?"
Fair enough question!  I explained "it's a really cool place to hang
out and meet people over drinks, great food, and great entertainment!"
