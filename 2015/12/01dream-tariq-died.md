<p class="dream">Making a copy of Tariq's data, I noted a pattern of full backups and
partial backups, so I was able to go back a week to get the most
recent full backup.  The current backup was going to be a full backup,
but it was aborted before it finished.
</p>


<p class="dream">Later, he and I were walking to the train station, and after I crossed
the street, I was like, "hey Tariq over here!" and he turned to follow
and was suddenly hit by a car like blam and instantly dead =
dismembered into blobs of white fat and two wooden egg shapes which
had been his eyes.</p>

<p class="dream">I had a sense that it couldn't be real, but didn't wake up. I was
shocked, and I feared it was my fault, as I had called to him, and he
was killed when he turned to follow me.  Riding in his dad's car, I
called Lin and told her "Tariq is dead!" and also wanted his dad to
understand, so I switched to Japanese "Tariq が死んだ!" and he took
notice and we drove to the location where there was a police vehicle
nearby so we directed him to the scene where some people were picking
up the blobs of fat.  I was too distraught to do anything.

<p class="dream">
Walking with some people in a new neighborhood, I realized they looked
like gang members, featuring big tattoos, spikey hair, knuckles,
jackets.  I spoke to the toughest looking one and said, "to be honest,
I feel a bit of fear around you guys, even though I know you're just a
bunch of guys.. Your outward appearance reminds me of some stories
I've heard about gang violence."
</p>

<p class="dream">
They were like, "well why don't you come with us?" and more fear came
up in me as they took me into a room.  I realized I was dreaming, but
didn't come fully out of it until I stated the intention that only
good things will happen in my dreams.
</p>

And I woke up out of the dream
