Lesson tonight featured four students, including Bob, Michael, George,
and Edgar, the English names of Yuta, Hirofumi, Ryo, and Masao.  We
reviewed "pumped" and Bob practiced answering "it was fine" for some
questions of the form "how was (it)?" because when I asked "How was
the party?" he originally answered, "I was fun."

Homework will be for each of them to create something and bring it (or
a picture) to show and talk about it.
