<p class="dream">
Fred came to Japan  and I helped him unload his car while teling him
about the things I had been thinking about which included how to make
some computer programs, or wondering how to make some computer
programs to do some type of calculations.  Like how to write news
article titles based on news articles; we'd have a function
`title.txt()` for the  article thatwould calculate the article
</p>

<p class="dream">
We went into the house and Fred realized that he had left his car
unlocked and I was like, "I'll go lock it, and then he realized he can
just beep it from here because it was not too far outide the bedroom
winodw.  He locked it, and it unlocked.  Oh he had locked it, so he
beeped it again and locked it.
</p>

<p class="dream">
Then he unlocked it and said watch.  If I don't come with proxxximity
of the car, it will relock itself.  It took a while and I started to
get sleepy so I got, just relock it I'm falling asleep, but I get the
idea.
</p>

At this piont I kinda woke up because I realized I was dreaming.

<p class="dream">
In a vaguey lucid state, there were some tough guys in front of the
conveni when we went to go inside, but I wasn't worried because I knew
it was a dream, and one of them dropped their cell phone as the other
handed it to him and I saw a cell phone commercial on the billbord and
they graphically showed the guys of the phone being swapped for a
different body, and I was like, "ah; I want that" so I kept watching
until the brand / maker was displayed and then they showed it being
used inside a shoe a la Get Smart, and a guy used the shoe phone and
sudently got a phone call from the Get Smart actor who said he called
because he was excited to promote the in-shoe phone technology.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I wondered how long he'd be calling people and wouldn't the
converaations get pretty boring so I better think of something
intersting to say when he called me after I bougth the phone.
