Tonight was the third open I group.  I posed a question like "what are
you resisting doing in your life that you think you should be doing?"
My answer was basically "promoting the group" because even though I
think it would be valuable for people to have a safe place to talk
about whatever they want to talk about, I hesitate because I don't
think I know how to explain it well.

During that discussion the idea of having a Japanese language version
of the group was presented.  Nice!

After the meeting, a couple of us walked to Shibuya and scoped the
construction on the Hikarie side.  Major changes in progress!
