Lin and I joined Sarupapa and Sarumama at an event in Stopover Tokyo,
between 外苑前駅 and 表参道駅.  Several clothing designers were there,
looking all fashionable / weird.  I showed five of my drawings, most
of which were unnamed and not necessarily finished.  I offered to give
them to anyone who liked them.  Ended up giving away two:
[*White Dots*](http://art.robnugen.com/wd15) to Veero (not Vwero), and
[*東京路線*](http://art.robnugen.com/tr15) (which had had a working
title of *Three or More Circles*) to Madoka and Mitsuro.

I asked Lin to write the kanji on 東京路線, but after seeing it
written, I wished I had tried doing it myself.
