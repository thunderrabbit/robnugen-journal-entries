Meeting with Satomi was fine as usual. yay!  We got her inbox filters
fixed so she actually sees emails sent from redmine when I do updates;
because those emails were skipping her inbox (and redmine folder/tag)
she didn't see when I finished things and so didn't approve them until
the next meeting.

Now they can preview things and I removed the unused sharing options
(Mixi, Google+, Pinterest) from the (demo) site.
