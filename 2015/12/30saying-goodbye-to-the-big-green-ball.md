A week ago, Lin asked me to fix the screen door before the end of the
year.  I said I'll do it or she gets an hour massage.  She also asked
that I release the big green yoga ball, which has become... how do we
say in English.. gross and sticky.

I took the ball out to the park and let dust cover the sticky bits so
it was no longer so sticky. (but it was still gross because now all
covered in dust and dirt).  Kicked it around for a good 30 minutes
before unplugging its stopper and kicking it around until it was
basically deflated.
