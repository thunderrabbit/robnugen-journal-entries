<p class="dream">I bought a neat game and asked Lin if she'd like to
play.  She was like, "I don't like games" or something and I got
pissed off like "you haven't even seen what game I'm talking about!"
and I got it out to start playing with it, but couldn't find it in my
backpack due to all the other crap that was in there, including a
cooler full of watermelon and spinach which had apparently gone bad
because I didn't remember having put it in there, and some bread type
sweets, so I started throwing all of them out of my bag, and noticed I
couldn't really stop though I knew it was infantile, and lots of
people were nearby so I wasn't making a very good example of emotional
awareness.</p>
