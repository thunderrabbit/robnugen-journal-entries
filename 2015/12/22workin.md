Today:

was able to get my e-money back from Toho Cinemas after I accidentally
bought Japanese dubbed Star Wars tickets last night.

got some end of year fixes done for CB site, including those
which they want to have done by Friday.  yay!

finished a ticket for AB site, though it's not completely tested yet.
(gotta test code note written in Hakyll, ya know)

am about to go see Star Wars VII
