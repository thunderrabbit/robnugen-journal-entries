Bah the CB website is acting up.  I happen to have been in Harajuku so
I'm heading in to the office now.

Well, I don't know what caused the problem, but everything seems to be
working again.  It happened last night for a few hours and again
tonight for a few hours, so I guessed it was simply being overloaded
by traffic, but Google analytics says it's not particularly swamped
right now.

Alfonzo assumed it was an expired SSL cert, but that doesn't seem to
be it either, because that wouldn't cause problems every 24 hours.

But the good news: I now have the .pem to log in to the server so I
can better troubleshoot things and blah blah.

Satomi uploaded the final image(s) they needed to upload before the
end of the year and we walked to the station together after closing up
the office.

We're kinda planning to have a take-a-party at her place to try and
fix her old iMac, which might just need a new hard drive..
