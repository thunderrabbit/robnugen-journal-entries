Met a new student who would like to practice presentations for his new
business.  When I heard that, I remembered all the times I've heard
that before, and all the times the students have quickly given
up. (80% ?)

I'd like to think it's not completely my fault, but in any case, I
have a good feeling about this particular person, except that he seems
to have a pretty busy schedule, and would like to have lessons on an
ad hoc basis, which I can imagine may become less and less frequent.

But anyway, his project sounds really neat!  He's not presenting a
bunch of boring numbers, but a bunch of exciting ideas, and I look
forward to helping him succeed in this new business endeavor.

We might even go on road trips to see the site.
