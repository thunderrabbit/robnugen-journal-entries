I didn't take many pictures, but I liked the house; it's on a hill but
doesn't seem to be in danger of sliding down in an earthquake.
There's a screen of tall bamboo behind the house, which I think is
really pretty, and pretty convenient if we ever need a giant stalk of
bamboo.

It's smaller than our current place, which concerns Lin a bit.  I just
see that the place is relatively inexpensive, in an area that I think
will increase in value, given Tokyo's proximity, and that the new
maglev train will stop in Hashimoto in ~12 years.

There's an elementary school, as well as a hospital nearby, so that
should help keep its resale value high.

The second place we looked at didn't catch my fancy; it looked
sterile, with no grass out front (just concrete and decorative gravel
for parking).  Inside stank of stale smoke so I didn't even venture
past the 玄関前

Wise words from MDX cooled my brain with some patience

    What's the lot size and is there some flat land? And can you grow on
    it if that is an interest? The other question is how do you envision
    life after moving? In other words unless the commute is a non issue,
    that should be considered.
