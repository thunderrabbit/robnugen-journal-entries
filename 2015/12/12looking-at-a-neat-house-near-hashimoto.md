I didn't take many pictures, but I liked the house; it's on a hill but
doesn't seem to be in danger of sliding down in an earthquake.
There's a screen of tall bamboo behind the house, which I think is
really pretty, and pretty convenient if we ever need a giant stalk of
bamboo.

It's smaller than our current place, which concerns Lin a bit.  I just
see that the place is relatively inexpensive, in an area that I think
will increase in value, given Tokyo's proximity, and that the new
maglev train will stop in Hashimoto in ~12 years.

There's an elementary school, as well as a hospital nearby, so that
should help keep its resale value high.

The second place we looked at didn't catch my fancy; it looked
sterile, with no grass out front (just concrete and decorative gravel
for parking).  Inside stank of stale smoke so I didn't even venture
past the 玄関前
