Lin and I slept late, wrapped up in blankets, trying to fend off the
cold weather.  She remembered that it's trash day and upon opening the
door to check if it had been collected, discovered the storm wind is
relatively warm!  I guess it's a typhoon, though I haven't been
watching the weather / news at all.
