I started this copy last night.  This morning:

[![dialog box: preparing to copy 9.2 million items](/images/software/bad/osx/10.11.1/thumbs/Preparing_to_copy_9.2_million_items_2015-12-01_at_8.54.32_AM.png)](/images/software/bad/osx/10.11.1/Preparing_to_copy_9.2_million_items_2015-12-01_at_8.54.32_AM.png)

Just now I noted it couldn't copy even the first folder.  There are
about 50 folders.  Perhaps it could have let me know sooner?
