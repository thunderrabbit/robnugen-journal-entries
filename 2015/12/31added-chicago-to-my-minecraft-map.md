Huge props to whomever created a
[scale model of Chicago in Minecraft](http://imgur.com/gallery/AiCND).
I tried to make a single .schematic file to import the entire map, but
it didn't work.. probably too big for MCEdit.  So I broke it up in to
<del>7</del> <ins>8</ins> schematics.  The eighth is but a sliver
between the 6th and 7th.  Though I highly doubt anyone will care, it's
relatively trivial to archive them online. https://github.com/thunderrabbit/http-imgur.com-user-damnsox-Chicago-schematics
