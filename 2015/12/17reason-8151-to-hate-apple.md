Oh Finder, why can't you find things?

The directory I'd like you to open doesn't even have many things in
it.  I rebooted the computer yesterday

OH!  That reminds me that this is reason 8,151!

fack I can't even keep up.

Yesterday my shit suddenly rebooted for an update which I clicked
CANCEL do not update.. surprise in the middle of work I had to wait
for 25 minutes or so for an update.  fuck you Apple.
