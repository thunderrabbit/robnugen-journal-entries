I just signed up for a TESOL course so I can fulfill my dream..  of being...
an English .. teacher .

wait a minute!  I'm already teaching.  haha

So I'm actually taking it because the syllabus looked pretty likely to
teach me some things I don't know yet, and it will probably help me be
a mo' betta' teacha', and i tmight just help me learn some skizzles /
give some inspiration to learn a little Japanese.  Plus the price
seemed reasonable.

I'll likely post my video submissions on my journal as well.  Dunno
about that yet, though.
