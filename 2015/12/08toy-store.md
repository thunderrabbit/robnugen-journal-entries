Each week for the past few weeks I have solved the Rubick's Pyramid
(it's very easy), and relinked the rings for any unlink ring-link
puzzles.  Today I also solved the pyramid-shaped wooden puzzle.  The
pieces don't "link" at all, so its challenge is basically something
like each piece looks like it could be a corner piece.

They've got a lot of Christmas themed items which are more decorative
than interesting for me, but blah I guess it's about to be Christmas
in some places, so fine.
