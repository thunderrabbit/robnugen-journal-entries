Lin and I are on 南武線 headed to 登戸駅 where we'll change to
小田急線 and go to 鶴川駅 for a nice little walk to the house!

登戸駅 is next!

We barely missed the local train, but we caught up to it in 新百合ケ丘
by taking the express train.  The local train has been passed by two
express trains now, which means that's something we'd have to
enjoy/endure/consider if we moved to 百合ヶ丘, at which (according to
Lin) only local trains stop.

I reallly really really like the house, its location, etc.  We
selected runes:

Overview:

dagaz

berkana reversed   (appropriate action)

Dagaz is like breakthrough and berkana is like "make sure you think of
others (ママ) as well, ね？

There's a bit of a hill, but overall it's closer to the station than
we are now, I think the hill will be a bit of a challenge for Lin's
mom at first, but that it would reallllly help her get fit and trim,
which I judge will help her be more healthy overall.
