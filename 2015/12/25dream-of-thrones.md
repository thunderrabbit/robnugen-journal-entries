<p class="dream">
There was some graffitti painted on the gate near the spies camp
inside the castle, something ke "The downfalll of W will be from the
camp of R on the inside", where W and R were the initials of the
family names involved.  I can't recall if R or W was the good guys,
but I was in favor of the good guys and we noticed that one man had
gone missing, and realized that he must have been converted to the bad
side, so I went off to find him and protect his girlfriend who loved
him but didn't know he would kill her.  I arrived at their compound
and read the graffiti then saw the girl standing outside.  I urged
her to run with me, but she was paralyzed with fear until he leveled a
crossbow toward her heart, and  I  took her hand as I ran away.  The
crossbolt didn't hurt us, and I put her inside my jacket for safe
keeping, and hid in a room when I heard some people nearby.  One of
them came into the room looking for a place to pee, and took a whiz
all over the floor in the room, but didn't notice me in the corner.
All of them came in, horsing around, and I wodered if I would (have
to) kill them as one of the flipped on the lights and I simply walked
away, hoping they would think I was a ghost or something.  They saw me
and were confused for long enough that I was able to jump out through
a window on the far side of the room.  I ran around a corner and jumped
up toward the celing where I was able to see the tops of the walls as
if the ceiling had been removed.  I thought that would be useful to
walk across them to escape"

and I woke up
