Like the little maze I received because it was broken, but a lot
bigger, there's a cool rotating maze at the toy store.  It's
essentially two radial mazes side by side, with two radial mazes on
top of them, geared together so they must turn in anti-unison.  Two
balls live under plexiglass fixed to the top of the upper mazes and
the goal is to get them out, through two holes in the plexiglass.

I wasn't able to solve it today, but I didn't give up; I had to leave
for MM lessons.

Toy store said they didn't find my MOOV.  Same response at the conveni
where I'm writing.  Boo.
