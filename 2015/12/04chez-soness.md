Headed to Chigasaki to help Soness with her websites; I don't know why
her sites keep getting hacked.  blarg.  I will try moving the sites to
new user....  hmm maybe I'll just start from a fresh Wordpress installation.

Yay lunch at a nice south indian restaurant!

We worked on Soness's sites some, so saw a bit of progress.  Called
her friend Ay who is also web savvy to try to work out solutions to
script problems.
