Great time last night in Akihabara with my GG class, including some
OGs and Yoko, the new g (on whom I have a crush; yow!)  Tim and Andrew
were there as well, being other teachers for the group.  I had lots of
[梅酒](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umeshu) and moved around the
table a couple times, something I normally don't do!

We went to karaoke afterward, and I did a few hip hop songs, and made
a karaoke note in my phone to help me remember which songs I like to sing!

1. Eminem "Business"
1. Disney "Be our guest"
1. Ricky Martin "Livin La Vida Loca" (English version)
1. Eminem "Without me"
1. Snoop Dogg "Gin and Juice"
1. LL Cool J "I need Love"
1. The Boom "島唄"

I joined on these songs which I added to my list:

1. Divinyls "I touch myself"
1. Gary Numan "Cars"
1. Oasis "Don't look back in anger"

Dang I should have moved to sit between Toshi and Yoko who were pretty
resilient in refusing to sing.

I didn't sing Alice's Restaurant
