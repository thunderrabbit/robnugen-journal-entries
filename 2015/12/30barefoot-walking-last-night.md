I went from my lesson in Harajuku, walked to the toy store where I
stop by every week to play with their puzzles, walked past a Japanese
garden, down 竹下 shopping street with lots of people, took the train to
Ebisu station, walked to my office, helped them with a problem on
website, back to the train in Ebisu, went to Shinagawa, then changed
to other line went to Kawasaki, then walked down the night club street
and talked to a few people then walked the rest of the way home... all
barefoot!
