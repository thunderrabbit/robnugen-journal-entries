I've enjoyed using Dreamhost for years, and have always been impressed
with how much I can do, and how great their service is for such a low
price!  Now that Let's Encrypt has gone into public beta, [Dreamhost
will support free SSL sooner than later.](https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/2015/12/03/lets-encrypt-and-dreamhost/)

I wrote this to them:

    Super Pumped and realllllly happy that you guys are considering making
    SSL the DEFAULT for all sites!  THat's fantastically fantabulous!!
    
    I've got it set up on one of my sites, and I tried it on another but
    haven't gotten it to work yet, so I'm really thrilled you guys are
    working hard to make this functionality easy.
    
    I'm so excited that I'm happy happy happy to be an alpha or beta tester for this and for the UI that allows us to turn on HTTPS.  
    
    And, I'm telling all my friends how great Dreamhost is to encourage
    encryption!
