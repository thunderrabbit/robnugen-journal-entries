I arrived late, just in time to see Soness present her story,
including many details I hadn't heard before.  I felt really pleased
to be mentioned at the end of her story as the only person who was
consistently there to listen when she was recovering from divorce.

Funny thing was that I was off to the side where 90% of the people
couldn't see me. (Because I rocked up barefoot, I was asked to stay
put, as well.  Fair enough.)

Good munchies (boneless fried chicken and other stuff I couldn't
readily identify, plus some thinly sliced meat over cantelope) at the
end, though I didn't completely load up because I thought I'd look
like a pig while eating and feel too full afterward.

Got to talk to Yuji for a good deal of the evening after all the
speakers spoke.  Last was Akebono, a Hawaiian-born Hawaiian who became
a the first foreign sumo champion ever.  He was pretty down-to-earth
relating in his speech how he likes to make someone smile each day.

Got to speak with Yoshiko, former owner of Ben's Cafe, who now is
doing photography after making movies for a while.  While she and Yuji
spoke, I asked if I could give her reiki, which she accepted and said,
"wow, [your hands are] so warm!"

Yup.  Every time I do reiki.  Plus it was warm in the room.
