I just bought an external drive featuring 4TB of storage space for $150.  Compare that with my
[143mb drive for $300 from 1992](http://new.robnugen.com/journal/2000/12/30/SOML/)

    size    size-倍    monies  money-倍      wow
    143 MB       1      300     1             1
      4 TB   28000      150     0.5       56000
