I cannot currently load
https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js
because this "free" wifi I'm on disallows https, so I can't run my
page, so... oh wait I don't need jquery to work on a different thing,
so I can work on that thing instead.  I was thinking it was like
coding without compiling, so it reminded me of stories where
programmers had to check their code N times before sending it off to
be run on the mainframe, and any error would mean losing a day of
work.
