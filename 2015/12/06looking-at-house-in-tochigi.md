We're on the train now.  It's apparently a 9 minute walk from 藤岡駅.
68 minutes on Tokaido-Utsunomiya line and then 16 minutes on the
Tobu-Nikko line or something.

Cute old house with a bit of a yard in front and nice neighbors on one
side.  The road out front is a bit too trafficked for Jennie to stay
alive very long, and the train tracks are near enough that we can hear
the RR crossing bell while inside the house.

The local station is just 5 minutes walk away.  Trains pass about once
every 5 minutes, but stop at there once every 30 minutes.
