As soon as we walked in to the first house, Lin was like, "let's go"
because the pictures she saw didn't match the reality as well as she
hoped.  The house is located near the top of a small hill/culdesac
with pretty small room for manuevering to park.

The second house on our tour was much nicer.  It's bright, clean, and
has lots of storage.  But the bathroom area is a bit small.  The
street it's on is small, serving only the 11 (max, possibly only 9)
houses on it.  The cats would have a relatively safe place to be cats.

Lin is in the third house now, talking to the agent.  I'm in the car
because we're not allowed to park on the street, so we've got the
hazard lights on.  I'm thinking our cats would not be particularly
safe here, unless they got smart about traffic.  There isn't a ton
right now, but this is like a 35mph zone, big enough for buses to
use.

Lin's been up there for more than five minutes would could just be due
to the sales guy, but might also be because she likes it.  I thought I
heard her happy voice upon entering.

But it's apparently a safe neighborhood for kids; there's been a
steady stream of them along the street and zero adults with them.  Ah;
one adult, but well over 200 kids I bet.

It's 12:55, and Lin's coming down now. She's asking lots of questions
and negotiating with the guy.

I went up to check it out; it's pretty nice! A bit old, and Lin wants
to replace all the wallpaper and flooring(?) which I think is a bit
extravagant, but who knows if we'll even settle on this house.

It's definitely the nicest of the three houses we saw today, but it's
right on a pretty busy road.  I think the traffic noise will be
annoying and the traffic noise makers might be deadly for the cats.
