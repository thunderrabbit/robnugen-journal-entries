Nice time chatting with Kai yesterday at newly-re-opened CPK in
Lazona, over a nice five cheese pizza (though I couldn't actually
identify but three).  We talked a lot about men's group and she
expressed interest in women's work as well.  Nice!

In exchange for lunch, I made corrections to the English version of
her flyer (blurbs for 12 concerts at Muza)

Afterward, we walked to Tokyu Hands where I bought some sealant stuff
for the soap dish I made for Lin's mom.

On the way back to drop her off at work, we stopped by a CD shop to
find a CD of piano music.  I listenend to it with Lin, and she really
likes it!
