Good last lesson of the year with GG, featuring only M and Te because
Y had to leave for a 忘年会 (end of year party).

Actually M was quite late, but she brought back the Digits in a Box
puzzle, which I think I've written about before.  She wasn't able to
solve it without looking it up online.  I plan to give it to Fred not
just unsolved, but without the containing box, so he won't immediately
know how small it can be made.
