Today I created a post for
[White Dots](https://www.patreon.com/posts/3912777) on Patreon.  I'm
not sure if the piece is finished, but it's close!

Today I added tiny dots around the white dots (and other colors),
added the squiggly yellow line that ended up being shaped something
like the kanji for mountain: å±±, and drew straight-ish lines under the
yellow squiggle and under its kanji.
