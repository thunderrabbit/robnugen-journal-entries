Showed him some vids I had uploaded of the things I was about to see:
Seaside Line construction and Seaside Line itself.  The giant post
hole digger has two halves which are welded together to ensure they
stay together during their operation.  Wouldn't the repeated welding
process eventually make the surface unweldable or at least unwieldy?
