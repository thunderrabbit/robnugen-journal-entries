I just saw (the original) Psycho for the first time.  I thought it was
quite slow at first, but it started getting interesting after the
second murder.  The long winded explanation at the end was a bit too
much.  I wonder what has changed to give me less of a tolerance for
such explanation as movie goers when the movie was first made.
