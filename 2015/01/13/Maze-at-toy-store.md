I went quite early to the toy store to see the latest toys, and the
guy was like, [Today is Shibata's day off.]  I found a couple of cool
maze toys, one of which I sort-kinda had in mind, but I hadn't thought
to make it with wood.  They're selling it for about 6000 yen (either
5500 or 6500) which means it costs about 3000 to make.  Three round
acrylic plates, one of which had holes drilled through.  The other two
were separated from the center with mazey wood, cut with a laser or
something cause the maze walls were quite thinner than I could do with
a jig saw.
