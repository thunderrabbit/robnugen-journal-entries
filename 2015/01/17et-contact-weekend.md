On the train now headed to something-Ichinomiya station in Chiba.

Should arrive in Chiba station at 12:36 and then I'll hop onto another
train for 40 minutes or so.

Great food at Boba cafe in Ishinomia.  Artist Hannah Sata had some
great pieces up in the loft.  Yeah, I can see how the guy last night
said mine look like amateur toys.

Just now back at the crib.  I wore two pairs of socks, hiking boots,
underwear, long underwear, long jeans, sweat pants, rain pants,
t-shirt, blue jacket, YRUU hoodie, LRG hoodie, my rain jacket, big
overcoat, neck warmer, knit hat, and nice gloves.  Everything was warm
except the three middle toes on my right foot.

Just took a shower with alternately cold, warm, scalding water; it
made me appreciate our consistently warm water at home!  Then ofuro
(bath) in a lonng wide tub, which could easily fit four people.

I basked in the water, letting my body float, with water periodically
covering my (closed) eyes as I breathed through my nose.

The bath had thin foam sheets floating on top of the water for
insulation.  I swam underneath them on my way out of the tub.

I forgot my toothbrush in the girl's room; we had used that room for
orientation and such, and due to some shuffling, Asuka is sleeping
there but we three guys are sleeping in the next room.  (Originally
she was going to sleep here.)  Anyway, my toothbrush is over there.
Moe joe fuzzy teeth.
