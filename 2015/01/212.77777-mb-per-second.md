OS X Updater detected nothin' because bah moe joe, and App Store was
unable to download XCode 6.1 because harumf harumf, but I was able to
download it from
[https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=Xcode#).

It's downloading at 2.7777 MB per second according to a
URL-of-the-Google calculation.  But my connection pulls down at 4+ MB
per second from proper CDNs.

Can't Apple afford a proper CDN?
