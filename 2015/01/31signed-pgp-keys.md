I verified and signed Travis' GPG key today, though I don't see my
signature on MITs server (yet)

Yumi giggled as we checked each other's passports while standing in line for Shakey's Pizza tonight.

Deji had a couple of plates of pizzas, and I had a couple as well,
plus a bowl of 枝豆 and a bit of corn, plus three small glasses of
Calpis.

Johan, Travis, and Yumi were much smarter about their consumption,
focusing on salad!
