    Hi Nugen,
    
    I emailed you a few months back to discuss any outstanding
    receivables you may have.
    
    As I mentioned in my previous email we work with many Business’s
    across the nation and we have developed a very strong approach for
    your industry as a whole.  During our tenure of working with these
    companies we have liquidated more than 50% (one as high as 70%) of
    the dollars placed with us for some of our clients.  We would like
    to show you the same successful results.
    
    I wanted to follow up and see if there is anything we can help with. 
    
    Again, there is no upfront cost to work with us, we’re only
    compensated when we collect your past due receivables: NO
    COLLECTION, NO FEE!
    
    I can provide references if you like of other business we’ve
    helped.  What our clients say about us is much more real than
    anything I can come up with.
    
    Would you be open to discussing in more detail sometime this week?
