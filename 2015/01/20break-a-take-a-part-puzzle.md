I went to the toy store today and they presented me with a puzzle they
had been unable to take apart.  It was like a "secret box" puzzle, but
was not hollow inside.  I set my timer for 30 minutes to make sure I
left in time for Mutsumi's lesson, then went to work.

I was able to solve it in about 25 minutes.

The guy saw that I had done it and came over to investigate; I showed
him how it went together.  While doing so, I dropped one of the pieces
and it came unglued!  D'oh!!  That's gonna be hard to put back
together so precisely, but they (of course) said it was no problem.

I considered buying it (out of guilt) because I had planned to buy it
if I hadn't been able to solve it before having to go to the lesson..

But I didn't buy it, nor did I take a picture of it (for Fred: hey,
here's what I didn't buy for you).
