There was an interesting game at the toy store today: Chaos, a disc
stacking game. Interesting are the rules; it's super simple, but
redistribution of tiles is forced at times during the game, making
predictions pretty difficult.  I wonder if it would translate well to
an online game.  The physical game uses a 3D play area so a 2D version
would have to be tweaked a bit.

After that, Shibata showed me some of their unpopular items which are
being sold for 50% off normal price.  They had a set of plastic stacky
pieces which were basically big Legos, but with softer plastic.

Also played with some plastic bars with magnets on each end and
marbles used as connectors.  She quickly stuck a couple of interesting
things together, including a hanging spinner and a sitting see-saw,
using magnetic replusion to offset gravity.
