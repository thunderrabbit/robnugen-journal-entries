It was my first time to go to a temple for New Years in Japan.  It
wasn't as crowded as I expected, though there was a pretty long line
of people queued up to pray(?).  There was a bit of a mob near the
bell that emanated some great reverberations each time a group went up
to ring it.  I was like, "I wanna ring it!" but turns out we'd have to
reserve a spot in advance.

Seo and Mika gave us a bunch of mikans.  So delicious!

After we finished walking around the temple, it was about 12:45am, so
the Ikegami line was no longer running.  Mike and Seo walked home (not
too far), while Lin and I walked to Kamata station, and then home from
Kawasaki station.
