Alex, our panda ear plant, has been hanging out above our balcony for
the past few weeks.  I hung him there so he could get more sun.
Normally we move him indoors when it rains, but since he's been above
our heads, I haven't seen him to remember (and I guess Lin hasn't
either).  I checked on him now, and he seems just fine.
