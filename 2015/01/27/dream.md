<div class="dream">
Walking next to the train while he spoke in English and it was
translated to Spanish for the local population riding on the train.
The train slowed down as I realized I was gonna get squished between
it and a fence, so I leapt across the tracks (with fence behind me and
train paused, approaching on my left) and then climbed aboard the
train as it continued its journey.  They had cool seats which gave
massages each time the train bounced; it was a simple inexpensive
design, using an old tire on an armature on a rocker connected to the
massagey bumps in the lower back of each seat.

Around 3 or 4 am I woke up from a funny dream snippet which I can't
remember at the moment.
