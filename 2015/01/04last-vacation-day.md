##23:28 Sunday 04 January 2015 JST##

Today was our last day of vacation.  I worked on AB and chatted with
Lin a bit about ayahuasca.  Lin watched _Disclosure_ and _The Green
Mile_.

Today, in remembered order:

##9pm

Around 9pm I was all "Moe Joe I have a headache; I'm going to lie down."

##daytime 

I worked on AB website, adding to the reporting system.  The first
thing I tried resulted in code that ran way long, so I broke third
normal rules to make it run lightning fast.  Now I need to write some
code to populate the non-third normal bits.

#8pm

I took a shower and hot bath because I was feelin' a bit blah after
coding so long.

#spoilers

I hadn't seen _Disclosure_ before, but I noticed Tom's phone didn't get
hung up when Meredith jumped his bones. I was like, "that's either a
movie error or a plot device!"
