On Friday or Saturday, Tariq invited me to go to the gym with him on
Sunday night.  We did; it was pretty well stocked for being cheap as
chips!

I used several of the machines, including elliptical "running" machine
(which was a bit weird), treadmill (which was a bit boring), and some
non-plastic-enshrouded machines which I can't name.

Back twist, arm push up, arm push out, arm pull down, leg push out,
and maybe others.

Then I used some 3kg free weights amidst guys hefting 3*(N, where N is
probably greater than 10)kg free weights.
