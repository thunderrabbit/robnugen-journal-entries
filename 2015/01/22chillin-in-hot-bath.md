Outside the Kagoshima airport there's a hot foot bath, which I enjoyed
for a bit over an hour.  Jon joined me for a smaller bit over an hour,
but a solid hour nonetheless.  (I don't know if I've used the word
nonetheless before)

Afterward, I kept my shoes off, so I'm barefoot on the airplane.  Awww
yeah so nice.
