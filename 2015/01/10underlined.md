I just finished a new piece I've called "Underlined", which features
ink on paperboard (色紙).  I started it a few days ago by drawing some
shapes without my glasses.  I didn't take a picture of them before
drawing other lines, but they're still visible, due to my policy of
not overlaying colors.

I might upload an image of it here, but for now, it's visible at its shortlink: [http://art.robnugen.com/u](http://art.robnugen.com/u)
