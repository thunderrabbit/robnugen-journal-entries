I took an express train and arrived here a bit early.

##18:00

Lesson featured five peeps from the previous class, so it's nice to
see them again.  We practiced self introductions, and I picked on
Ayako a bit to help her recall the phrase I gave her.  "I work at XXX
as an assistant to the CEO." She couldn't quite articulate
"administrative assistant" so I swapped out the words for her.

##18:38

Headed home now.  Spoke with Chris who I'll see again on the morning
of the 21st to join the kids lesson so they won't be like, "wha?" when
he's there for their presentation and I'm not.
