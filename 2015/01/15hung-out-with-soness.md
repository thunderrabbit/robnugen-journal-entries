Went to Soness's house today to help her arrange some lights and have
her help me help her file some forms.

Great to get yummy lunch and just hang out having fun, plus mailed
some books plus panda shaped chocolate to her friend despite the
drippy skies.

And then got lots of goodies from her pantry!  She's got lots of
healthy stuff from iHerb and gave samples entire containers of
everything she recommended.  omg too much!!

More huge hugs and walked back to station with backpack full of
goodies.

Arriving in Kawasaki now to see my babychan!
