Hmm.  That date isn't correct.  My computer battery died while I was
writing an email (thank goodness for free wifi and that Gmail saved it
in realtime) and I guess the clock battery died as well???

Okay this is more likely to be correct.

I slept for a good bit of the 7 hour flight from Perth to Honkers

Didn't see the TV guys when I got out of the airport, but I must say
it's nice to not have to wait in a line 200 people long in order to go
through immigration.  Will it be even faster (not have to fill out an
arrival card) when I have my permanent visa?
