I honestly didn't know what the white limestone was called, but I
found it with a search on Google for
[white stone with shells impressions](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=white+stone+with+shells+impressions&hl=en&biw=1338&bih=801&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=uGOsVOuPH8Wl8AW7ioGQCQ&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg)

I was debating whether I should waste Andrew's time telling him about
my dream when I realized one of the key things I saw was the limestone
steps, and the first image I found which clearly shows them is at
dcfossils.org.  "DC" as in Washington DC.  Andrew is running for US
President... wow!
