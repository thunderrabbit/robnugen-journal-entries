Productive points:

1. got Debian installed *and* the firmware for the Broadcom wifi card.
1. made a great nametag for Jennie
1. made a great almost business card for amazeaweek.net
1. on the way home, I added beeps(*) to buttons on our unity game

Delicious points:

1. Thai food!
1. okashi!
1. ice cream!

Fun points:

1. music
1. people
1. laughter
1. shrinky dinks!

Next time I hope to remember to bring my 3Doodler so people can play
with it, though it's not as community-centric as the shrinky dinks.

(*) but they are "hardcoded" to play; they don't respect the Options
-> Sound FX status.  Crap; they were easy to put in, but I'm not sure
if it's easy to add check for the status of that option.
