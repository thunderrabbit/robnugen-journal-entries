I still haven't quite gotten over りさ in Japanese class!  Her
piercings are just "too wild" for me, plus she has "face-framing bangs
to die for" as MJG wrote in
[Mr Ruins](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Ruins-Thriller-War-Book-ebook/dp/B00MEI2BWQ),
the fantastic start to a fantastic trilogy!

Today she came late, so I didn't get to sit next to her until the end
of class.  At the same table were Robin (Japanese+Dutch guy from
Canada) and the guy from Israel whose name I still haven't committed
to long term memory.

I walked back to the station with Robin, telling him that I still
haven't gotten over りさ.  I'm trying to get to know her better so I
can stop seeing her as just cute piercings girl, but she's really
sweet as well.

Anyway, he agreed, and we headed our separate ways, until Wednesday
for more fun times in Japanese class!!

Class today was a bit harder than previous lessons with Ayako; she had
a transcription of about 20 minutes of _Spirited Away_, a movie I've
apparently never seen because it's not _Totoro_, which I call "the cat
bus" one.

I didn't take home notes from the Ghibli movie; I've got enough notes
for today from my (first) hour with Masa-san.

On the way home right now, I'm sending text messages with Lin and
Mika.  Sending cat pics and saying how cute Jennie is.
