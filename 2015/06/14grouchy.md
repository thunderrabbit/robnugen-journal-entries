I've been enjoying Japanese class in Akihabara and Lin is of the
opinion that everyone there is trying to find someone to hook up with,
but that's simply not true.

But we do hang out and chat and there is cute りさ there, but no hanky
panky is happening or planned.

This morning I was like I'm going to meet Tariq, and then later, oh
it's for his daughters' karate thing and Lin's all mad that I didn't
tell her before.  I don't know why I didn't tell her, but a long ass
conversation about it won't make it any better.
