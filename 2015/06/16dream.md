<div class="dream">
I climbed the tree by using my legs/feet as  hands, and baically
climbed with hands and feet gripping the tree below me. I had to
climb back down a bit once I reached the level of the tree house
because there was no door on the tree side of the house, so I climbed
down ~~to the roof are~~ to the floor level and carefully stepped onto the
floor.  The floor was quite solid and particularly dry, covered in
foam cushions.  The other guy was sleeep already and my two friends
were there, having just climbed as well.  I saw some pornography in the
corner but didn't look at it; just made a mental note for later.  We
commented about how dry the place seemed; the roof must be perfectly
sealed.  I looked over the edge and saw a woman on the ground below
and was like "HI" but she didn't think to look up; she looked around
like who said that?

This was a dream where I definitely did not think I could fly!!
