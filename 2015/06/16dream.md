<div class="dream">
I climbed the tree by using my legs/feet as  hands, and baically
climbed with hands and feet gripping the tree below me. I had to
climb back down a bit one I reached the level of the tree house
because ter was no door on tat tree side of the house so I climbed
down to the roof are to the floor level and carefully stepped onto the
floor.  The floor was quite solid and particularly dry, covered in
foam cushions.  The other gu was sleeep already and my two friends
were there, having just climbed as well.  I saw soe pornography in the
corner but didn't look at it; just made a mental note for later.  We
commented aout how dry the place seemed; the roof must be perfectly
sealled.  I looked over the edge and saw a woman nt the ground below
and was like "HI" bu she didn't think to look up; she looked around
like who said that?

The was a dream where I definitely did not think I could fly!!
