Japanese class was difficult for me emotionally, I guess.  It was
really crowded and chaotic and loud; I could barely stay at the end.
I was like, [peww] headed out of there.  Tsun, Lucia, and Lauren (I
think his name is) were like, "so soon?" and I stood with them a bit;
they spoke quietly, and it was nice.  I don't know what it is about
the loud ostensibly fun conversations, but I just shut down mentally
and emotionally.  what is that all about?

I know when I took a personality test it said I clearly need people
time *and* alone time.
