Lin's friend Mikako came over last night, a night I was originally
scheduled to be out at an ET contact event.  They made gyoza as I lay
on the couch, not feelin' all that hot!  Not sure why.  i'm feeling
genki 95% this morning, though so I'm headed to see Travis, Yumi,
Matt, and Calire, and maybe others.

Last night I was also planning to go to Japanese class, but I skipped
it to chill with Mika.  I showed her how to do LastPass, and she was
like, "ohhhhhh" and "すごい！" maybe.  She had seen it before but not
100% seen it in action.

Gyoza was delish (of course) and we stayed up late chatting about
nothin' and stuff.  I took an instagram pic of my light and Mika in my
bed from the vantage point of my futon from last night.

During the night I moved from futon to couch and then finally slept a
couple hours on Lin's bed.  It was just like musical beds!
