Just attending Japanese class in 80's Cafe.  It's the third time リサさん
has attended, and the third time I've sat next to her.  I like her
piercings and smile. :-)

Today she asked me if it rained much in Houston, and I showed her the
pictures of recent flooding there.  I actually didn't really know just
how bad (and quickly) it flooded.  wow.  I hope everyone is okay,
though I know flood damage suuucckks.  A lot of other students saw the
photos and were like, oh shit!

Today I wrote a few new sentences.

青森には急な形の屋根があります。　　　The roofs are steep in Aomori.
日本の食べ物と飲み物は量が少ない。     Food and drink portions in Japan are small
東京よりヒューストンの方が湿気が高い。  Houston's humidity is higher than Tokyo's
ヒューストンの湿気は東京より高い。  Houston is more humid than Tokyo.
アメリカでは野球が有名です。   Baseball is famous in the US.
ヒューストンで育ちました。   I was raised in Houston.
お桟橋と言うふとうはきれいな形でした。   Osanbashi pier has a beautiful shape.
