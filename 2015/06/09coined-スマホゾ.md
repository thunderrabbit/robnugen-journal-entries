Right now I"m on the bus and スマホゾ had to be told by the bus driver
to move to the back of the bus. I wonder where it will lead in the
future.  Will these attention-swallowing devices become transparent so
we can (attempt to) interact with them and the real world at the same
time?  Will there be ubiquitous personal locomotion techniques that
allow complete sensory immersion in the devices so the real world can
be ignored?  Will there be legislation passed that limits the use of
such devices while in self-guided motion?  Will there be violence
between the factions of real-worlders and personal-worlders?  Will
robots do the shopping for people who prefer to immerse themselves in
the tubes?
