On brief glance, I've got the top page and journal pages working in
Hugo with the same content and URLs as Middleman has been producing
for new.robnugen.com.  (though I haven't checked the Japanese-titled
entries (or entries with multi-word titles.  (okay okay I only checked
one entry))) Next I need to add the samples repos and make sure those URLs
all work nicely.

After all that, I might convert all my journal entries tags sections
to use the format Hugo expects.  I essentially know how to change all
the existing entries, but I'm not sure how to tell Emacs (much less
Sublime) how to write the new format.
