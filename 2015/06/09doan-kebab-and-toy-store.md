On my way down Takeshita street, I heard my name, looked up and saw
Doan from Japanese class!  Neat!  He had just been studying and was
looking for a bite to eat so we went to King Kebab on that street.
Kebab munchin' we headed to the toy store to check out the goods!

We played with a marble track thing which has about a 70% success
rate, which I guess is pretty good for being made of building
blocks..  I hadn't tried to make things with it before, but did so
today with Doan.

Mai helped us a bit, as we weren't familiar with the available pieces
or how they were designed to go together (normally I'd shun any help
in favor of exploration, but in the interest of time, it certainly
helped!)  We made a relatively significant change to the overall
structure, allowing two previously too-close tracks be connected with
a stack of long tracks.

This was the night two women who spoke Chinese and English came in to
buy some stuff and asked why their wifi device wasn't working.  We
directed them to a shop in the area for their cell provider.
