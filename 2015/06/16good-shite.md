got some pretty good shite done at work today. S and I have set up
weekly meetings and they've been pretty productive. Today we closed 3
tickets right off the bat (she hadn't seen that I finished them during
the week) and probably closed a couple others today. There are still
some outliers I don't know how to solve yet, but generally speaking we
are making much faster progress than before (when I didn't have
meetings with her during which I can ask questions, usually some
variant of "can you be more specific?"

In other news, when I went to the conveni, I got a facetime call from
Yoshie, who (later) said she had been calling me back.  WTF?  I sure
didn't call her.  My call log looks like we called each other back and
forth which is wayyy fucked up.  I haven't called her for ages.  I
wonder if my phone is having a heart attack or of it was due to a
network problem or if 1337h4x0r5 did something.

Nah it's some fucked up apple shit. there are tons of hits for
"Facetime ghost call" Fuck apple man; I'm leavin' (as soon as this
phone dies or pisses me off enough) and ain't neva come back.

Oh, in other news, it's Fred's 35th bday soon and we're going to play
Portal as soon as we can figure out how to set it up on The Internet,
or "hip hop" as you kids call it.
