I don't know how to read them yet, but after I was just telling
Mutsumi that the weather cannot get hot enough for me, she showed me
kanji above the train door which mean "this car doesn't have the AC on
full blast."  Apparently, it doesn't have the AC (compressor) on at
all!  Just fans, and I love it.

The kanji are written above the doors on car 4 of this Yamanote Line
train.  I'll keep a lookout for them and head to those cars whenever
possible.  Woohoo!!
