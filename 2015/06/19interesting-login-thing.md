I just found [Clef](https://getclef.com/) (while registering for
[coindaddy](https://coindaddy.io/) after reading the coinparty had
been hacked (it hasn't), and wondering how my
[RABBIT](https://dogepartychain.io/asset/RABBIT)s are doing. (they're
fine)), and am intrigued enough to try
[adding clef](https://docs.getclef.com/v1.0/docs/quick-setup) to my
static (ahem) site.
