I'm at the conveni chowing two
[Bourbon ChocoBrownie](http://shop.bourbon.jp/ItemDetail?cmId=3884) bars, the most amazing candy bar ever
formulated by humankind.

I've probably eaten 80 to 100 of them since they were released a
couple months ago.

My comment on their site:

    これは神さまが自分で作りましたでしょうか？
    
    不思議最高な味。おめでとうございます。ありがとうございます。
    
    God himself made this, right?
    
    It's unbelievably perfectly delicious.  Congratulations; thank you.
