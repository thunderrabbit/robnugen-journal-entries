    Good luck with your site.  I'm blocking you as spam because of the way
    you set up the email link.  My friend wanted to connect with me so I
    click YES in the email, but the screen to which I am sent is a New
    Account screen with no login option.  I then visited wayn.com directly
    and via cookies you still said Please Register instead of giving a
    login screen.  THEN, when I tried to stop emails from you, I have to
    enter my email address?  No way.  You sent a tracking link; you can
    prefill my address.  Use your fancy website skills for things that
    help the UX, not make it shitty.
