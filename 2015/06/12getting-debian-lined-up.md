I'm using my Debian box now, wirelessly (thanks to you), using a dual 
monitor setup (thanks to Debian maintainers), and have gotten several 
things working well, almost including the ability to make changes for 
work while my other machine is in the shop.  You suggested that I can 
reinstall Debian when I get my next PC, but is there some way to save 
time reinstalling all the junk on a new Debian install?  If not, then 
perhaps I can just update the kernel and keep this same hard drive in 
the new machine.  Speaking of which, I looked for Dell laptops in the 
Akihabara area, but didn't find anyone who can help me get an English 
keyboard and a blank hard drive.  I may come to the next TLUG meeting 
to see what's people suggest.  Or, might just just order straight off 
Dell's site. Okay, not sure how much longer I can keep up this margin 
alignment, so I'll find some way to end things so it lines up nicely.
