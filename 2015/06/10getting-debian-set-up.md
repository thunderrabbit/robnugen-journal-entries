Today I used my virtualbox instructions to get Virtualbox set up.

Installed SublimeText2 and SFTP (though I haven't used it yet)

Next steps in that direction are

1. ~~set up ssh keys~~
1. ~~connect them to bitbucket and github~~
1. ~~download my work repos~~
1. ~~connect the repos to virtualbox via SFTP in Sublimetext~~
1. make some changes and fix some bugs
1. ~~download journal entries~~
1. set up my middleman repo with git clone --recursive
1. ~~edit journal entry~~
1. set up my push, pull, publish script
