Funny how I've not worked on my journal infrastructure for a while.
Lin just today asked why it takes me so lonngg to put the stuff back
on my desk.  I told her it's cause I'm careful, but it's also cause
I'm lazy / busy with other junk.

In the case of my website, it's only because I'm busy with other junk.

Yesterday I reinjured my elbow picking up Lin's bicycle to carry over
the train tracks on the way to meet Masa at noon in Lazona.  It was
stupid because I did it out of frustration... uh, no I did it quickly
out of frustration that I'm not allowed to ride on the sidewalks
around the station.  I should be able to get a license that proves I
can navigate the スマホゾ (smartphone zombies) without hitting any of
them.
