My right elbow has been hurting from too much mousing, I think.  I got
a recommendation from Tariq, via one of his students.

    His name is 吉川泰弘
    The nearest station is 駒沢大学駅
    His clinic's name is 駒沢病院
    His position there is 整形外科部長

I looked up the hospital and it turns out it's the same one where I
had my shoulder surgery done 9 years ago. (*)

So I pulled up [surgery.robnugen.com](http://surgery.robnugen.com) (NSFL) and
discover that not only is it the same hospital; he's the surgeon who
did my surgery!

(*) Not only that; I got the recommendation 2 days ago, which is 9 years
(to the day) that I was discharged from the hospital.

I showed doc a couple of the photos from the surgery and it seems he
remembers.

I told him my elbow hurts and he pressed around a bit and I was like
"yeah there" and he goes okay, "do this" (make a fist and tilt wrist
back).  He held my arm to resist the motion as I did so and *boom*
pain. Yep that's the one!

Just got 2 X-rays taken, and I hope I'll be able to post them online. :-)
