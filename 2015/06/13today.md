Today I worked on getting Hugo to do some things I'd like it to do.  I
created a crappy theme and used pagination functions which spewed out
300 pages worth of entries.

Need to get prev/next working before I'll actually have it a bit
further than Middleman, but wooodoggie Hugo sure is faster than
Middleman!

Worked on pong a bit.  Now the AI is a bit more random about what ball
it chases, but it's definitely not smart about it!  Play
[pong to 50 points](/samples/unity3d/pong/16-pong-to-50-points/).

I signed up for [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/) so I can study
and keep my progress synced across devices!!

Oh, and I put some of our homemade yogurt into a towel, hung it in the
fridge, and hope it will make cheese.  Let's see.

Oh, and I made a maze for Katerina.

Oh the one big thing I can't do yet is type Japanese on the Debian
box.  I looked a the docs a bit and was like, ummmm..

Hopefully tomorrow I'll use the new old Dell Debian box to make an
edit to AB website.  T added a ticket today, and hopefully it will be
an easy fix.
