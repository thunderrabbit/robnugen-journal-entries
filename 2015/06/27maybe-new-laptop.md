I was looking at each of these systems online when Travis pointed out
I haven't actually touched either one.  They're each around $1000 from
[Think Penquin](https://www.thinkpenguin.com/), with difference being
the CPU, USB ports, and screen size.

Korora Penguin GNU / Linux Notebook

1. Hard Drive: 1TB
1. Memory: 16GB DDR3
1. Wireless N: Wireless N (TPE-NHMPCIE)
1. Matte Screen Upgrade (non-glossy): Glossy Wide Screen
1. Mouse: Traditional Wired Optical Mouse (for notebooks)
1. Notebook Warranty: 1 Yr Ltd Hardware Warranty
1. Distribution to Install: Debian 8 Jessie

But Travis brings up a very good point: I haven't touched the
machines; maybe I will hate the keyboards, mouse pads, etc.  Will my
external keyboard be enough to keep me happy?  Am I offending the gods
if I use an Apple keyboard (after saying I'll buy no other Apple
hardware)?
