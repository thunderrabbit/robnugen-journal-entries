## 17:15 Thursday 11 June 2015 JST

I'm about an hour early; I'm going to look at laptops to see what I
can see.  I should prolly also jump on TLUG list or go to a meeting
before buying anything...

I wandered around a bit and couldn't find anything good in any of the
smaller shops.  Even when I found things that seemed basically good,
they had Japanese keyboards, which aren't good for me.

Went to a couple big box stores.  One said they don't sell machines
without an OS installed.  The other one said come back later (I
think), and I might.  But not tonight.

The lesson was great, as usual.  GG are just so positive, inquisitive,
thoughtful, and lovely!

They had a meeting afterward, so we didn't walk to the station
together.  That worked out well; I had planned to tell them I was
going to go to 80s Cafe.

I went to 80s Cafe for the English lesson there.  It was a much
smaller group than the Japanese lessons, but still the same kinda
format: one instructor and students.  I seemed to be the only native
English speaker on the student side of things.

After the lesson ended at 9, everyone promptly left, and Wada-san and
I chatted about junk, arriving at cheesemaking as my next plan.
