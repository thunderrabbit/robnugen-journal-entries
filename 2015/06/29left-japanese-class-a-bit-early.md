Japanese class discussion ran a bit late and I felt anxious to prepare
for work tomorrow so I left before the discussion had finished...  it
sounded like it would go easily at least 20 more minutes.

I can see Lin's concerns with the class; it's great in some ways but
isn't really good for comprehensive learning.  Gotta find a teacher /
real class fo real.
