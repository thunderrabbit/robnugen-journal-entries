It rolls and sounds like it's new.

The little generator thing was set to (slowly) carve a groove in the
wheel, so I mentioned that to the guy.  (I had explained it to him
before; I had to buy new tires because it had destroyed the old ones
with its patient wear.)  He tried to move the light up so that it rode
flat against the tire, but could not.  So he put a full bonnet cap
over the generator so it would only quietly contact the rim.
