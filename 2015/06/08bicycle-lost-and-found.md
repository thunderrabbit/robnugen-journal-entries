The bicycle parking area was full, so I parked in non-space out of the
way of any pedestrians.

I went back three hours later and the bike wasn't there.

Aw man.

I walked around the place looking for it, but couldn't find it very
quickly.  Dang.  So I called the number listed on their "got
problems?" sign.  The woman was like, "okay so *which* parking area
are you talking about?" and I was like, "ummm" as I found the bike,
and though I know how to say "I found it!" I said, "I'm not sure which
area; I'll call you back." cause I didn't want to seem like an idiot.
