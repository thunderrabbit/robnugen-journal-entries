## 21:50 Tuesday 24 November 2015 JST

This morning I worked a bit on Apple TV app, but couldn't figure out
how to set the `preferredFocus` to the correct view.  I see what the
docs say, and I tried to click and drag the thing in the interface,
but it simply didn't work.  Bah.

I'll skip it for now and move on to the next bit.

Then at CB I increased the images on two of the site indices to be 90
by 90 pixels instead of 70 by 70.  It took a teeeeny bit of CSS
tweakin' to make them look okay, but it wasn't too bad.

Then for AB, I tried updating the datatables plugin, but it still
doesn't look right in Chrome.
