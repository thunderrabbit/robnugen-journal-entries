    I believe you’ve said they should not be able create inquiries to
    filter the items (and put them on MyList), so at this point I’m
    planning to remove the filter tab for these users.
    
    Oh wait!  I can’t remove that list for them, because people who are
    not logged in already have it.  It says “log in to add items to
    MyList”.. so I think we have to retain this ability for these users.
    
    So, if they can filter items, I think it’s important to explain the
    difference between their self-made filters vs filters which you write
    for them (which they cannot edit).
    
    What do you think?
