JB called me this morning just after Lin and I finished meditation.
"Hey can you leave right now to teach a lesson?"

I arrived a few minutes late, but the students were lovely, eager,
varied, inquisitive, and several other adjectives that mean nice.

I was pinch hitting for Benny, who I know from NOVA back in the day,
so I told them to ask him about "baseball loudspeaker," a story he may
have told them already, but I wanted to make sure they hear it because
I think they'd enjoy it.

We talked about Texas, Houston, names, the Lone Ranger, the Texas
Rangers, food, pastimes, Bush, CIA, WTC7, and at the very end, alien
bases on the back side of the moon.

The time seemed to zip by, and at the end I received some candy from
Junko, a chocolate bar from Reiko, and a payment for lunch because
they assumed I hadn't brought any lunch after being called on such
short notice.  I emailed JB to say it was lovely, and I'll be happy to
teach there any time they like.

Now I'm headed to next lesson, though I have a bit of a gap which I
hope to fill with food for me and my computer (but esp. my phone)
