I walked to the lodge from Kiyosato station after inquiring at an info
desk near the taxi statnd.  I'm glad I didn't take a taxi; it's
straight down a hill with only a tiny little incline.

We are in 伊予ロッチ Iyo Lodge, the name of which reminds me of いいよ,
or "sure thing"

Anyway, I took a nice nap for nearly an hour upon arrival, and then
joined the group for a 20 minute meditation.  This time, my brain woke
up a lot after I started focusing on the intervals between my breaths,
trying to link them smoothly.  My consciousness was just like *ding*
and became very focused on the present, with very little blahblahblah
background chatter.

Dinner in five minutes and then get our futons ready for sleeping, and
then another meditation and *then* head out to the field to welcome friendly
contact from nearby extra terrestrial beings.
