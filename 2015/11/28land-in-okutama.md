Lin and I went to Okutama to chill and look at some land.  It's on
sale for a mere(?) $60,000... but it apparently doesn't get much
sunlight.  There are plenty of hills in the area, being that it's in
the mountains, but by the time we live there, I'm sure self driving
cars will be the norm.

We're on a train that goes from Okutama to Tokyo station, so it's a
single line (and we have seats), but it takes more than a few minutes
to travel the distance.
