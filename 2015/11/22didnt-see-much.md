But the weather was reasonably warm for the season.  Quite overcast,
though we saw the moon peek through a few times.

haha remember PEEK and POKE in BASIC?

Lance and I were just in the free massage chairs for around an hour
after we bathed in the 24 hour お風呂.  My massage chair inflated
balloons at various points, whereas I think his used rollers to
massage.

We talked about free energy, Kissinger and Vietnam, fiat currency,
Germany wanted its gold back (sorry charlie), JFK, 911, and a couple
others I forgot.
