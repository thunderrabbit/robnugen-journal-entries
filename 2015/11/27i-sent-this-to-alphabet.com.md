    The team at http://hellokraftwerk.com/ are producing a really cool
    "portable power plant" which I backed on Kickstarter.
    
    They've been hard at work, progressing nicely, but a big portion
    of their time is being spent on a lawsuit regarding the *name* of
    their product.
    
    They need to raise $2 million to cover these unexpected legal
    fees.  The company seems great in all other respects.  From their
    about page:
    
        [T]he originator of the idea is Sascha KÃ¼hn, CEO and founder 
        of eZelleron Inc. After obtaining a degree in materials science, 
        he went to complete a PhD in high temperature fuel cells. He
        has many years of in-depth experience in this future technology.
        Sascha is the author of more than 30 patent applications and 
        has already won several industry awards.

    Can you please please please help them out?  I think their product
    and ideas will help revolutionize portable power supplies, and
    help people lead more active lifestyles.
