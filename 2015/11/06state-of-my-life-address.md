1. As I write this, I'm going the long way home around the Yamanote
   Line; I just sat down at Shinjuku station, and I plan to switch to
   the Keihin Tohoku Line in Ueno or somewhere convenient.

2. Have had a few tickets stacking up for AB and CB websites, but on 1
   November, I released version 2.0.0 of both the frontend and backend
   of the AB website.  It uses a new system for logins which allows
   the login to be decoubpled from the persona using the site.  Soon,
   different "types" of users will be able to log in.

3. CB site has requested a few changes as part of their low-key
   redesign. Basically they want to redo the entire site, but I don't
   know how to design well enough to do it, so we're doing it kinda
   piecemeal.  16 November will be the next visible change.

4. Lin and I have started thinking about buying land "out in the
   country."  I'm happy to do it just as an investment; I imagine its value
   will appreciate more quickly than if the money just rots in the
   bank.  Lin has a bit more practical aspirations, so somewhere in
   between we'll probably get a house that's not too far out and can
   be "fixed up" in a reasonable amount of time, whatever that means.

5. I drew a vision board-ish thing showing the land we'd like to buy,
   featuring a stream and some adjacent open land on which MKP
   trainings can be held.

6. I've been in touch with a guy in the US who's starting an import
   business, so in a way I'm starting an export business.  No one has
   profited yet except the post office and convenience store where I
   paid for shipping within Japan, but it's still a fun project for
   now.

7. I've not been studying Japanese recently, but I sorta kinda have
   considered possibly starting again.

8. I've not been drawing mazes recently, and I haven't really
   considered starting again as much as I've thought about studying
   Japanese again.

11. I've started drawing images again.  It takes a bit of effort to
    create all the meta data: posting them to my wiki, my URL
    shortener, and Patreon, but it's still pretty fun.

41. I recently bought some new markers, but haven't used them yet!
Hopefully I will like the colors.

9. I sent Fred's 2016 journal today.  He likes that late nights and
   weekend days get ample space for entries.

10. I may start teaching lessons on Friday night; it's for a single
    semester if in fact they decide to start.  Trial lesson is next
    week or something.

12. Ted has started coming back into the house, but he hasn't yet
    stayed inside with the door closed.  He regularly comes in to eat,
    snoop around the house a bit, and go back out.  We could close the
    door while he's in snooping mode, but I want him to feel
    comfortable that he can go back out.

13. Lin has been working lots at work, and I often don't see her until
    10pm at night.  She enjoys the work, using English while helping
    her clients, and getting to see lots of different houses.

14. We recently bought a Dyson vacuum cleaner, which is battery
    operated, and lighter than our previous plug-in version.  It's
    pretty neat, and has their signature clear dust catcher in which
    all the dander has a party before heading on a new adventure.

15. I'm planning to give Lin a massage coupon which says something
    like *2016 Special Massage Coupon*, and has a checkbox by each
    month of the year, plus an extra checkbox in March for her
    birthday, and July for our anniversary.  Don't tell her.

16. Also planning to get her Harrod's Bears for 2011 and 2015, to
    bookend the three she has already.  Don't tell her.

17. Pop Pop Chaos features variable pricing for bubbles!  There are
    about 600 blue bubbles now, and they cost about 700 points to make
    new ones.  There are approximately 0 green bubbles now, and
    whoever logs in can *gain* points for creating new ones.

    I've kinda mussed up user thunderrabbit on the game though; I
    hyper-clicked to create blue bubbles and laughed as Meteor didn't
    keep up with my clicks, allowing me to go past my point credit
    limit.  Then it caught up and I'm in the red like 75000 points.  Dang.

18. My plan to meet Lin tonight worked!  I've just switched to
    Keihin-Tohoku line in Ueno (by simply walking across the
    platform), chose one of the plentiful seats, and will arrive in
    Kawasaki around the same time as Lin so we can have a nice date!

19. Tariq and I have been working on an app for Apple TV; it's sorta
    kinda almost finished, though I still need to work out a couple of
    bits that I'm not sure how to do.  It basically presents 140
    business vocabulary words which are the most commonly used + most
    commonly unknown by his students.  Tariq has worked for 10 years
    compiling the list, so it's certainly valuable!

20. Tokyo I-group will have its first open meeting on Monday November
    16th in Hiroo from 6pm - 8pm.  One of my mates from Japan will
    join us; I'm optimistic he will benefit from the work and attend
    regularly.

21. This coming Saturday Lin and I will be going to a Reiki share in
    Asakusa.  Oh maybe while we're in the area we can get some good
    prezzies for people in the US for belated Christmas.

22. While in Texas, Lin and I plan to go skydiving, eat steak, and get
    officially married in the US!  Might even get a driver's license
    for me, cause they cost $3000 in Japan.

23. Haha I just realized this is the second time I've been in
    Hamamatsucho today.  First time was for a lesson, and I left on
    Yamanote Line; this time is just passing through on Keihin Tohoku
    Line.

24. At the toy store I visit each week before MM lesson, I found an
    intricate maze puzzle had been broken with a bit of brute force,
    probably applied by an over enthusiastic person.  The store
    employees were like, "welp, you can have it!" and I was like,
    "yay!" cause I fixed it in about an hour (not counting time to let
    the glue dry), and it's perfect now.  Retail price 5800 yen or so.

25. I should show the maze to Travis before taking it to the US.  It's
    basically the same architecture as he suggested once, but with one
    extra, um, twist.

26. Speaking of Travis, I left my neobbbbium magnets at his house a
    couple weeks ago when we went for a visit to see them and Johan,
    Matt, and Claire.  Maybe we can arrange for a swap; I'll show him
    the maze (before taking it to Fred in the US) in exchange for the
    magnets.  (not that they're being held hostage)

27. In Minecraft, I `/sethome` in a cave under a lava-soaked
    mountain.  I immediately dug a staircase down to level 10 or so,
    and have been digging a "huge" hole around the staircase, just
    because it's funny.  Man, what a waste of time.

    I need to somehow convince myself to spend as much time drawing in
    real life as I do digging in Minecraft.

28. Lin and I have been eating much(!) more healthily for ... a week
now.

29. For the past three weeks, I have joined an online I-group on
    Thursday mornings, Tokyo time.  I guess at a basic level it
    amounts to life coaching and holding each other accountable for
    achieving our individual personal goals.

30. Yesterday in Kamata, I taught three (3) lessons, featuring a total
    of 8 young students between ages 6 and 11.  The best thing is that
    in the nearby convenience store, I found my *favorite* candy bars
    still available!  I saw them "everywhere" for a while, but then
    stopped seeing them.. It's like they're no longer being
    produced. boooo

31. Still haven't really nailed down our plans for the US.  It's kinda
    weird to have things to do during vacation; how can I plan shit if
    I have no idea what other fun things will be available?

33. In general, I'm teaching 6 lesson hours per week, programming
    about 25 hours per week, most of which is done at home with the
    cats catting around the balcony door.

32. Arriving in Kawasaki now; see ya in a sec while I chill out at the
clock to wait for Lin.

34. I did *not* end up buying a new computer a few months ago when I
    was preparing for this one to go to the shop for its
    end-of-warranty checkup.  So, I'm still using my MacBook Pro,
    which is now about 3+ years old, I guess.  I don't know if I've
    made an entry for it in my `Items:` category on my wiki.

35. I'm still using my iPhone 4S, with iOS 7.1 or so.  The lastest
    models are iPhone 6S and iOS 9 or so.  I'm sorta-kinda looking for
    a replacement phone; I will almost certainly go with Android.

    BUT, I don't really want to give up this phone since I have an
    uncapped unlimited data plan for a fixed price.  That plan is
    apparently no longer available, so I'm sure that when I switch
    phones, they'll force me to pay for a different plan.

36. I've recently purchased unlimited encrypted storage on SpiderOak,
    for $149 per year.  It sounds great, but I don't see a way to just
    toss data on their servers without it *also* residing on my device
    here.  I guess if I have N computers, I can store all of their
    data separately; .. hmm maybe I'll try to install a SpiderOak
    client on my not-really-used Ubuntu machine which is essentially
    just wasting away on my desk.  (it's the one I got as a possible
    (interim) replacement for this machine.)

37. I need to pee, but Lin's about to arrive in about 2 minutes haha

38. Recently Hideo sent me an email with dates of a clinical trial in
    January, but we'll be in the US.  I guess I won't be going down
    there again unless they have trials with an age limit above 45!

39. I recently took apart a little ionizer thing that Lin said didn't
    work anymore.  I extracted its squirrel cage blower (did someone
    say generator??) and may play with it, but it's pretty low
    priority now.

40. I gave blood a bit more than three months ago, so I've just added
    an alarm to remind me to give blood again soon.
