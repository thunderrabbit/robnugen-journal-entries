Last night I wanted to support Lin to help her relax after work.  I
know she wants the house to be tidy before going to bed, whereas idgaf
how messy it is.  I was like, "can we talk tonight?" and she goes, "no
way I'm tired" because she thought I asked something else.  I
inexplicably go, "okay but if you stay up cleaning everything I'll be
really angry," which right up there near the top of several lists of
things not to say at various times.

Fortunately we got it sorted pretty quickly; I realized what she
thought I asked, and explained I hadn't asked that.

TL;DR: I'm an ass.
