Pop Pop Chaos now has variable bubble prices!  The price to create a
bubble actually goes negative if there are fewer than 30 bubbles, and
gets quite expensive if there are more than like 200.

Chris and I played Pop Pop Chaos in the French bakery in 新杉田駅.  He
hadn't seen the variable pricing on bubbles (cause I just implemented
it last night or so).
