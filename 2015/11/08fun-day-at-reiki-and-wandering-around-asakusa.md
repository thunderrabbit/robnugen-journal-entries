We attended a reiki share in Asakusa, featuring a reiki master from
Kyoto.  He was quite friendly and chatty, both in English and
Japanese.  It was the second time or Lin and I to join this particular
reiki share.

Afterward, we wandered around Asakusa with Jon, had sushi at a 回転
sushi shop, went to an
[English book store](https://www.infinitybooksjapan.com/) where we
bought a total of three books, and *then* walked to Tokyo Sky Tree
where I got a bunch of gifts for Fred (in a pay-by-the-container
system).  I really showed them; the lid wouldn't even fit on the
container it was so full muwahahahaha-ahem.  yeah.

Oh, and then ice cream!

Now we are on an express train which will go all the way back to
Kawasaki.  Noice!
