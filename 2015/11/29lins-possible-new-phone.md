Lin's like "it's shiny and they said it works great!"

I'm like, "........... ummm..  maybe you'd be more likely to make the
right choice if you actually use the phone (a lot more), first."

So we're doing that now.  kinda.

Though Lin gave all her infos, and the clerk scanned both the phone
and the sim card as having been selected, we didn't buy anything.

On the way to buy ice cream and think about the phone options, Lin
noticed her work phone wasn't where she thought it would be.  I
guessed she had left it at home so zoomed home on my bike and found it
on her desk.

Yay! She called her current provider, and they beat the price Lin was
offered today.  Nice.
