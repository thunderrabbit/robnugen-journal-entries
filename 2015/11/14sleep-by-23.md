## 22:47 Saturday 14 November 2015 JST

I often stay up late wanting to be productive, but actually not being
productive because my brain needs sleeeepppzzz.

Tonight, though I realllly wanna stay up and keep working, I'm going
to hop in bed and start sleeping.

## 11:37am next day

Yay!  I successfully xslept before 11pm last night.  Woke up at 6am to
do laundry and work on AB website.
