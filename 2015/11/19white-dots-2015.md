Nice.

I'm chillin' at a conveni near my lesson in Akihabara.

I brought a new (small) shikishi to start a new drawing.  However,
when I pulled it out of my bag, I realized they only markers I have
are Posca, which I sorta kinda don't always like.  I like the ink, but
the nibs on these particular pens seems scratchy and don't always draw
nice lines.

So I decided to buy a brand new pen.  Whatever they had here at the
store... I figured I'd end up with a fine line color pen, like a 0.3mm
pen... but the ones they have *might* be eraseable / some variety of
not waterproof, so I chose not to buy them.  They had some big fat
markers, but I've got plenty ... oh hooooo what's this??

Is that a white-out pen?  Holy cats it is.  Nice.

I'm going to start with white dots on my white paperboard.

Haha nice. Okay I've got about 100 dots on the paperboard.  Had I
planned a bit, I might have left some, um, whitespace in the middle,
but for now it's on one corner.
