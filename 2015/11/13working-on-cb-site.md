Headed to CB to work on their site from 1pm to 5pm, before I gotta
head out to my lesson.

Didn't finish before I had to leave, so I left.  Then I came back to
grab my suit jacket.  Moe joe I don't want to do this lesson bah.

Haha I'm headed back to CB to finish up changes to the touch version
of their website.

Fortunately, I was able to take りんかい line, so it's just one train,
featuring available seats!
