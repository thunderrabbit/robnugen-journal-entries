Eda invited me to lunch in exchange for helping her with questions
about her new (first) smartphone. She's pretty smart herself, so she
figured most of it out in between the time we arranged the lunch and
had the lunch, but we still enjoyed the lunch a bunch, chatting about
cats and such, plus a couple questions about which she had no hunch.

She showed me her website.. (I think it's
http://mouseintokyo.wordpress.com), and I showed her my game (I think
it's http://www.poppopchaos.com/), and I showed her my website, which
has a problem in https mode.  robnugen.com refreshes to
https://new.robnugen.com/ which fails to load its CSS for some
reason....  ohh I bet I know why!  I probably laods the CSS files
using http instead of // so they are refused when the site is
loaded using https.

I'll fix that as soon as I remember.
