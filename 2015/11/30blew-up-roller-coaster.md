D'oh!  HAhaha I tried out survival mode after giving myself a kick ass
diamond sword and 32 spawned skeletons.  They nearly killed me, and
then a creeper finished me off, plus destroyed a small section of
roller coaster.  hahah oops!  I think I repaired it in a way that all
the previously linked tracks are linked again.  I tested one track and
it seemed correct.
