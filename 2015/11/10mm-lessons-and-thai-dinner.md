During the first half of his lesson, Sarupapa asked me about MKP and I
told him as much as I was able with my broken Japanese and English
hybrid sentences.  He said it seemed interesting; I wonder if he'd
eventually be interested in attending I-group with us.

Sarumama came after that and we went over her homework.  She's really
improving and would be a great inspiration if I wasn't so frickin'
lazy to study Japanese!  blarg.

Then we went to Thai dinner in a nice small (8 bar seats) downstairs
Thai restaurant near Yoyogi Station.  I felt all なつかしい to be
sortof in Thai-mode of greetings with respectful prayer hands which
I've continued to do since being there for just 3 months ... five
years ago!

Goodness I loved that life.
