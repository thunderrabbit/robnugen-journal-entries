Okay, so I just received in the mail my [MOOV](https://welcome.moov.cc/), a movement tracking device which
can connect to my phone via BLE, Bluetooth Low Energy.  Nice.

All excited to set it up, I see the app requires iOS 8.

Now, I've resisted many a fancy app which has had this requirement.  I
don't want to cripple my iPhone 4S with an "upgrade" to the OS which I
don't really need.

The above article title doesn't sound good for iOS 9, but at the end
they're like "bah might as well do it" (my paraphrase)

So I clicked the fancy Install Now link on my phone.

I see the password dialog, anddddd can't paste my password into it.

Fuck you, Apple.  Fuck you if you think this in any way is a smart
design decision.  Basically you want me to have a shitty password so
that I can type it here?  I can't use my password
E4'h<v,ei7\,R!nwo/e-'W9gvYG;P% very easily now can I?  You think I'm
going to type that shit in on your shitty keyboard?

This is like the 100th extra nail in the already decrepit coffin for
my relationship with Apple.

I want a divorce, all my money back, plus damages for pain and suffering.

### cause anyway

Is it not bad enough that I can only use 32 characters for my
password? I'd love to know why they decided to add that crappy limitation.
