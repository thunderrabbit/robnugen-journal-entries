Yay!  Pop Pop Chaos now has a 7-day leaderboard.  Each user's points
accumulate by date, and the last 7 days are summed to make the
leaderboard scores.  This allows new players a chance to shine, and
encourages all players to keep playing!

Because it's kinda moe joe to clickclickclick so much, I might make
bubbles inflate just with mouseover, and click will create new
bubbles.  Hmm.
