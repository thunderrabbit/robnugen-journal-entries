I'm cancelling my plane tickets for Perth.

And getting new ones so I will be in Perth longer!!

After receiving an email detailing the weekend schedule (which starts
on Thursday night), I was like O_o at seeing how much
container-building I would miss by arriving Friday late morning.  "Oh
shit," so I bit the bullet, asked for help covering my classes, and am
about to cough up cash to make it happen.

Once the change is confirmed, I need to update three calendars:

1. Mine
1. --JB's--
1. Stephen (my contact in Perth)'s
