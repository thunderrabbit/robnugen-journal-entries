1. Maybe the biggest overall thing, which I *hope* will become a big
   thing in the future: In October, I'm going to staff a NWTA in
   Perth, with other men from https://mkp.org
1. I have my plane tickets and all other costs are covered cause I'm
coming from overseas.
1. I just bought a soft plastic stackable brick toy set for Lin's
   clients' son's enjoyment. PolyM, Art.-No. 73061 Helicopter, after
   having been given the chance to play with a big box of the bricks
   to make "anything," so long as it fit on the shelf here next to
   まい's creations.  I guess she was all created-out after making a
   few different displays with the bricks.
1. I didn't take a picture of my creation, but it was kindof round;
   the pieces are soft-ish and more forgiving than LEGO, both for
   construction and trodding with bare feet!  I'm sure they're also
   far less durable, but oh well.
1. Today I saw a note that c0de is stepping down from his many years
   of hosting DELTA minecraft server.  I thanked him for his hard
   work, and he'll certainly be missed!  (not that it will affect me
   at this juncture; I haven't logged on to the server in months)
1. Today at work I helped Satomi fix her /etc/hosts file to reconnect
   to a website which inexplicably has had its DNS misconfigured. I
   mean how hard can it be?  I said, "it should have the same IP
   address as (ABC site)," but it's still not fixed.
1. Mutsumi has retired from lessons for the time being.  He said he's
   busy.  No, not Mutsumi!  The *other* Mutsumi!  Happily, Mutsumi's
   still attending, and I'm thankful for her hard work, both at study
   and looking for other students to fill Mutsumi's place!
1. I haven't gone to Japanese class for months(?)
1. I haven't drawn a maze for a month?
1. BUT, Pop Pop Chaos is coming along pretty well.  I am sorta-close
   to having rolling high score list implemented, but I just need to
   deal with user's names having been stored in different locations
   based on how they logged in (via U/P or Oauth).  Bubbles grow when
   clicked, the turn dark in proportion to how close they are to
   popping, and people reach the high score list based not on points,
   but on *creates*, which require points to obtain.  I'm pretty happy
   with it so far.
1. The GG lesson used to be M, T, and Te, but now it's going to be
   just M and Te.  And only for 1 hour instead of an hour an a half.
   Boo, but still better than a big bowl of nothin'.  Only problem is
   M tends to speak more than Te, so I want to be careful to make sure
   Te has enough talk time.
1. Had a new student today in other class (via Tariq); he'll join for
   two months, which is perfect because C has said she'll be busy for
   2 months.  She will hopefully enjoy slightly easier lessons than
   what I had been doing to challege her before the new student
   joined.
