We met at Takeshi's tonight, our first meeting in over a year, I
imagine.  The last meeting I called in an emergency being all
confuzzled about junk, though the issues mostly resolved by the time
the meeting happened.

This meeting was called from a much more sane and golden space: I'm
going to staff NWTA in October, and I'd like to help our I-group grow.

to do

1. look for mkp men in Tokyo
1. Look for lists of email lists
1. ask to be on leadership email lists
1. Announce myself as point person for Tokyo integration group
1. Next meeting 23 October
