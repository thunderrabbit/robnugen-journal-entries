Mai showed me a new game at the toy store today.  It's like sudoku in
a way; it's a piece-placement puzzle, given a few rules, can we fit in
all the pieces on the board?

It has pretty simple to explain rules; I might buy it next week to
give to Fred in January, but dang I've already gotten a lot of puzzles
to give him.  How many until too many?

Also, it's 2400 yen, whereas comprable puzzles of the same brand were
2000 yen, so maybe the price will drop with time.  But still, it's
just a bunch of plastic, so ...  dang ya know I could *make* the
puzzle except that I don't have all the puzzle clues themselves.  I
wonder if I can recreate enough of them to be happy with not buying
them, and I wonder if I can make the puzzle without taking too much
time.. Well yeah I can for sure; it's only 16 pieces.

consider it done! (?)
