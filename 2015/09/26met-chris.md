Today on the way to Paola and Jon's I saw an apparently English
speaking man on the train.  We made eye contact and smiled, and I
thought, "hmm maybe he'd be interested in MKP."

I sat for a few stations before deciding fuckit, and I went back to
speak to him.  He seemed interested enough to swap email addresses,
and I emailed him this afternoon.
