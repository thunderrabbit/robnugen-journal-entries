Now, to be clear, I haven't actually seen/met
[Lantz](https://loreatec.jp/e/), but the Internoodles assure me he can
fix iPhones in a jiffy.  I'm just starting this optimistic journal
entry on the way there because I cannot browse cat pictures on my
phone.

I've been here for 12 minutes, and the phone is essentially fixed!  He
removed the bottom screws and backplate, then swapped the broken thing
for a new thing and the phone is charging.  We're going to let it
charge until it boots and then call it good.  :-)

It's good.

The battery isn't fully charged yet, but it's charging, and that's
exactly what it didn't do before I came.

Thanks, Lantz!
