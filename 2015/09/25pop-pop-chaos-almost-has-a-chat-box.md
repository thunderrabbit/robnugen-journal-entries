You heard it.  Coming soon, I hope!

I just need to:

1. Figure out how to save users' names to a consistent var when they
log in
1. Fix the CSS for the chat box, which I'll call "Pop Pop Chats"
1. Add tabs to flip between chat box and leaderboard and nothing
1. Do all the other work I should be doing instead >__>

Goodness!  After waiting in line to get cash from ATM, the machine
apparently couldn't read my card.  I went upstairs and they were like,
"yup, it can't read your card!"

"And your address isn't up to date, so we can't send you a new one
until you update your address, and we can't update your address
without a little wooden stick with your initials on it."

Aww man....
