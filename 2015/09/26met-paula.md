I met Paula at Paola's and she seemed to share some similar interests,
including self growth.  She's traveled a lot, including spending 1.5
years at an ashram in India.  Wow.

One of the old guys there told her "many lifetimes; I'm a permanent
resident" when she asked how long he'd been there.  Nice.
