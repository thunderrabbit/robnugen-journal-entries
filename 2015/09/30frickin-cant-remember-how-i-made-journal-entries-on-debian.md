I just added all the crap above by tweaking a copy from a previous entry.  Didn't I have a slick way to make entries on this Debian box?  Emacs would be my guess, but I don't see it installed.  wut.

Maybe I just didn't set it up again after I wiped the machine and installed everything (else) again.
