<p class="dream">
Living inside a QT movie, therewas a spooky scene and then a couple
guys were walking along the beach with the task of digging up a dead
body.  One of them goes, "okay start digging, and the other was like
where? and then the first one fell down a bit of a cliff and revealed
her corpse, and  he goes, "right there" so they dug her out and she
was actually still alive, though animated with  spooky spirit ghost or
something and the card overlay said "Despite her looking like a nyph,
this scene is quite scary"
</p>

<p class="dream">
So while watching, I was prepared to turn it off or walk away, but it
never got scary too much.   There were two undead women teaching me how
to fight and they didn't rip my face off or anything and I was
thankful for that.  In fact, they seemed helpful and nurturing.  I
felt a bit relaxed as we had a big sparring thing and then as we
relaxed I saw a clock count down a random series of digits and then
reach the end.  I go, "what's that??" and was a bit afraid again.  One
of the women said she didn't know, and then we saw a bunch of bats
flying to surround our glass building.

Uh oh.  We coudl see them all smoofing around outside, so we turned
off the light inside but I recalled that bats could see infrared and
therefore our heat signatures.  So we turned off the light and then
could see that some of them were inside anyway, and the two girls who
had helped me sacrificed themselves to attack the bats, but it wasn't
enough as there were thousands of bats, so I tried to tattack them a
bit, but bailed due to ineffectiveness.

<p class="dream">
One of the well dressed vampire bat men with slick backed blonde hair
bit my finger with a smile as I flew in to kill him.  I realized it
was fruitless so I bailed to a new scene in which I was in San
Francisco back in the day when it was stil active Alcatraz.  We looked
out at the island, but there were lots of islands in between and I was
sure I could get out to it, or a way from it..  A three times retired
army general (served for 60 years) said he would swim out there with
me.  He jumped straight down over concrete right next to teh ocean and
sdove feet first directly down into the water just inces from the
concrete.  I saw him in the deep water, propelling himself forward
with just his feet kicking as his arms trailed back.  He made god time
and I jumped forward so as to not be so close to the concrete.  I
wasn't straight as I hit the water and so didn't go very deep into it
There were some other boats in hthe waster of some people bothering
us, and he suggested we go over to a room blocked by a grinder that
was stopped so he went past it, and then I saw him (now  little kid) on
the other side as the wheel was starting again.  He had been giving a
piece of paper to take back through the tube and I willed the grinder
to not move so he'd be okay.  Then some other people tried to come
through, starting with an old man, but I couldn't control the grinder
as it started to move so I woke up.
