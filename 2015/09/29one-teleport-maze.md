Yoshie canceled her lesson today, so I decided to work on a maze
instead.  I'm starting with a piece I had started already.

I just finished a piece I've titled "One Teleport Maze" because, if
it's a maze, and if the start and end points are the bulbous areas in
opposite corners, and if the dots are teleports, and if the paths are
either the black paths or the swirly paths, I can solve it by using a
single teleport.

I wrote its permanlink to be http://art.robnugen.com/otm, without
checking it first.  I figure I can add a character if necessary but it
turns out it's available.  No surprise because I haven't got *that* many
pieces yet..
