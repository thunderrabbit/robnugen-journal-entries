On Keihin Tohoku line now approaching Oimachi.  Will arrive in
Kawasaki in about 12 minutes, at which point I'll go to Wired Cafe to
drink up some addictive internet, on which I plan to email Lin that
I'm back, and look for a guy to fix my phone.  I'm sure it can be
fixed; just the chargin' parts are borked.

And maybe I'll try to find a toot for integrating Soomla into a Unity
app.  They seem to have all the right parts, but not yet so flush on
examples.
