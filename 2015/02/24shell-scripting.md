I made the md5 cheater script, and want to augment it a bit to do
something entirely different.  I have never really programmed shell
scripts, so we'll see how it goes.

I wonder if I should search for Bash scripting tutorials or stay with
more fundamental *nix code?  I think I'll go for Bash; this project
ain't very important, and I just want to get it done, plus I'm
probably the only person who will use it, and I only use Bash.
