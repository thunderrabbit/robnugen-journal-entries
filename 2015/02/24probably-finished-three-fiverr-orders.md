Just got some nighttime photos of a logo at Shibuya scramble for a guy
on Fiverr. He's got a pretty interesting project, encouraging
education through what looks like a fantasy adventure motif.

I haven't looked carefully through the materials, but the website is
[magicaemathematica.com](http://www.magicaemathematica.com).

Somewhat foolishly, I forgot to charge my phone so it died after the
took "10 or 20 photos".  Yeah, I've done that before; stress the
battery in a sprint and it dies like boom.  It will come back without
overtly charging it, but I'm on the way home already so I hope the
existing photos are okay.

Okay, so that was one order.  The other was to send a postcard (1
order) with a maze on it (2nd order).  I spent a good deal of time on
it, working hard to use bezier curves in Gimp to do it, but my printer
failed to print it the right scale..  or I failed to make the right
width/height ratio on the image and don't know how to tell the printer
to scale it (nor how to scale the bezier curve anchors to fit a new
size image).
