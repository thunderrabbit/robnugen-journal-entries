Last night I realized I must have left my computer power supply in Ebisu.

Today I went to Yodobashi Camera and specified I wanted a power supply
for *this* computer (which they had on display).  Upon arrival at home
I discovered the power supply they gave me was not the power supply I
requested.

I immediately blamed the sales guy mother fucker frackin smackin waste
my time fricken asshole pendejo piece of s

you know; it's really not his fault.  Let's blame Apple for changing
power supply interface and not making it particularly easy to know
which power supply to buy for what computer.  They're both 85 watts.
Why not give them obvious model numbers or something?

Back to YC and was like,
[yeah so I requested the power supply for *this* computer and got the wrong power supply]
maybe something like, このパサコンのパワースップライを書きたかったけど、
これは違う。

It wasn't the same guy with whom I had transacted before, so he was
like [just a moment] and got the manager.

Manager was like, [yeah, but you opened it.]

I expected this.  For some reason it's really hard to return opened
electronics in Japan.

I was like, [yeah; I didn't know it was wrong until then.]

Anyway, a total of three times I waited, and twice he was like, "yeah
but you opened it."

I was trying to figure out how to say "how you gonna say that I should
know if it's right when your own sales guy didn't know it was right?"
but fortunately it didn't come to that.

I explained that I had specifically requested the power supply for
*this* computer and even counted the contact-point bumps on the inside
and the other guy repeated the number (5) agreeing that it was fine.

He finally got the original sales guy and they sorted it out.  Yay!
