<div class="dream">
In a large house with many rooms, a woman was kinda stalking me,
telling me she wanted me to give her a baby; I was like no way and
trying to escape her, through different interconnected rooms and
department store displays.  I ran down a long hallway and downstairs
to where my sane friends were outside and I realized I could fly, so I
flew upwards and wondered if I could fly quickly this time, and found
that I could.  Some high tension power lines were there, but I was
able to quickly fly over them and away.
