At the toy store, I found some sets of themed images drawn on some
cards, copyright Stephanie Graegin and produced by
[eeBoo corporation](http://www.eeboo.com/).  I thought "these would be
useful during my lessons," thinking my students might enjoy making
stories with the cards as prompts.  Then I was like, "AND I can use
them in my Japanese lessons!!"

I got the "Animal Village" set, so I'm about to learn nouns in
Japanese like fox, skunk, porcupine, squirrel, and platypus... plus
campfire, guitar, marshmallow (though I bet the last two are just カタ
カナ versions of English words).  I think squirrel is リス.  Then I'll
learn phrases like "play guitar", "roast marshmallows" and "hide
behind a tree"...  *Then* I'll tell stories about a bear trying to
steal candy while the other animals skipped school and ate
marshmallows while the fox played guitar causing the rabbit's
marshmallow to become invisible!  And that's just from the cover art
on the box!

I'm getting (a little bit) excited about taking lessons again.  Will I
study?  Will I keep it up?  Who knows??!!!!!
