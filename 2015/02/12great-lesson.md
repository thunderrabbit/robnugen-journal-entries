Such a nice lesson tonight!  This was my first time to meet these
students; they are three lovely women, two of whom are retired, one of
whom does not have a computer nor TV!  Wow!

We laughed a lot and they asked lots of questions and tried lots of
speaking; I need to learn from them!

Also great: there are plenty of seats on the train on the way back.
