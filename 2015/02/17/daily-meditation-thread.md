Yesterday, someone was like, "I'll give anyone 500 bits to make some
more givaways" so I made a thread on /u/BitTippers encouraging people
to meditate.

Decided to make it a daily thing.  I wonder how long it will last!

Nice, I just got a tip for 500 bits; that should pay for a few more
days at least!
