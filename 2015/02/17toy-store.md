Shibata was hammering a chisel on something when I went in to the toy
store today.  She said she was "making sand", which I couldn't really
disagree!  She was chipping sand from a block of fake sandstone, which
they had apparently made by mixing sand with some kind of glue.

I doubt it was made by Mother Nature because the sandstone had a
plastic model of a dinosaur in it.

I was like, "what's this?" and she goes "stegasaurus"

"Ah.  same.  What is dinosaur in general?"

恐竜 (きょうりゅう), "scary dragon"

ふつの竜がこわくないですか？　"Aren't regular dragons scary?"

ま、ね。。  "well yeah, but"
