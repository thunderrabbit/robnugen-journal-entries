Fred and I video chatted for four plus hours while at our respective
offices.  I finished a maze-on-postcard for a guy on Fiverr, and then
read the recent
[AMA by Snowden and crew](https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wwdep/we_are_edward_snowden_laura_poitras_and_glenn/),
and acted as a rubberduck for Fred while he got some code (closer to)
compiled.
