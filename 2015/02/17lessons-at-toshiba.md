I love teaching at Toshiba because the topics are so sciencey and
interesting!  Today Tomomi met me in Kawasaki station and introduced
me to some new people at Toshiba.  I had gone in earlier, thinking I
would have lessons with the attendants, but they were all like, "ummm
not today!"

Good thing I called JB, who was like, "don't worry.  Wait for Tomomi
and she'll get you sorted."

While there, I watched one of the demonstrations with liquid
nitrogen.

Spoilers!:

They dip a flower then crush it, dip a rubber ball then drop (and
shatter) it, dip an inflated balloon to watch it shrink (and
reinflate), and dip an inflated clear plastic bag to watch it shrink
as liquid appears on the inside.
