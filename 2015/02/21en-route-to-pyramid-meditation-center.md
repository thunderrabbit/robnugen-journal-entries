Lin walked with me to Kawasaki station and waved byeeee as I headed
down the steps to the train.

In 東神奈川 station, I got some snacks and headed down to the
platform, from where I saw two excited kids on the train at the next
platform.  They were looking around to see what they could see, so I
waved to them and they waved back and said whatever they said about
some stranger waving to them.  They were on a local train, so my train
arrived before theirs left.  We waved again once I had gotten on my
train; we were now more than a meter closer together and only 1 meter
apart (including two panes of glass and a gap between the trains).

In other news, I emailed JB to see if he knows a Japanese teacher who
lives near me.
