Yesterday around 17:43, JB called me all, "yeah can you come teach
from 6pm to 9pm *today*?"

That worked out nicely!  I had asked JB for a single lesson _off_
yesterday, so I could go to Kagoshima.  I was therefore scheduled not
to work, but got 3 hours instead of 1.  Thank you, angels!

While there, JB offered me 1.5 hours of lessons on Thursday nights.
That's tonight, right after I hang out with Soness!
