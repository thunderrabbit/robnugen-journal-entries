In a large field with lots of peole as a spinning flying contraption came down.  It had a large ring on its owter borader so it whn it came down near me, I was able to grab it.  It had conventional fans to keep it aloft, but it was still intersting and a guy climbed onto it to see how it worked.  he shone his flashlight inside and saw chsts of drawers whcih surprised us, but then he got off and we let it go, but unfortunately  some kids had climbed onto it and they fel one by one.  They all survived, but were in a bit of shock.  No one came to help them, but they found each other and walked off haarm in arm.

At a school where I hadn't been before., I was looking for a lock for my locker.  I asked if they had locks for sale or rent but they didn't know the word lock. I explained it in thersms of lockers, "there's a hole here and it's a device that fits through the hole and keeps it locked."  Ah yes, I might be able to get one from a company down the street.  Prince Joffrey from GoT was teling me how to get there and I insulted him a bit (intentiaonaly, not afraid of him) and he was a bit surprised but  didn't retaliate hah

There was an interesting lock mechanism consisteing of a ball track, but it had different sized balls and  a squirrel cage fblower and I tried to figure out how it all worked, and was surprised by how empty it was after I took off its cover.

I got back to my stuff and my phone was ringing; it was my dad, but I couldn't answer it.
