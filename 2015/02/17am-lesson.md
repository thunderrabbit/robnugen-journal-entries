Finished my AM lesson with only M in attendance.  We talked about paid
vacation days.  The article mentioned France with people taking 93% of
their 37 available vacation days.  In Japan people took 50% of their
18 vacation days.

M took 5% of his vacation days, and seemed pretty O_o when hearing
about other cultures.

"I thought vacation days were just for emergencies!"

hmm..
