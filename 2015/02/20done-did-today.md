Recently I have been posting "Daily meditation threads" on
/r/bitTippers, encouraging myself and others to take some time to sit
quietly each day.

The posts get about an 80% approval rate, with some people saying "wow
thank you!" and some saying variants of "no way jose". Fun stuff!

Today was the fourth such thread, I think.

I worked on a maze for a guy on Fiverr.  It should be pretty neat when
it's done.  Well, the project over all should be neat.  It consists of
9 postcards with a maze drawn across all of them.

His preferred recipient will get just the center card, with maze paths
flowing off the edges of the cards on all sides.

Was about to work on AB when I remembered I said I would finish
something for CB today.  I checked the ticket in Redmine and found a
new ticket with priority "Immediate", so I did that one first.  It was
my original mistake (ahem) so yeah.

Started working on the ticket I said I'd do.  It required some image
duplication (basically extend a ~1500 x 15px png to be ~1750 x 15px and
add some sections to it) which will be visible through CSS.

I finished adding three sections to it and then logged the time in
Redmine.

Hmm; it seems someone already updated the image!  D'oh!

I downloaded their zip file (weird for a single image), annnnddd

ohhh I see why it's a zip file.  30 separate images, in jpg format,
with a crappy font, *and* inconsistent spacing of the text on the
images.  Oh, and a misspelling, AND missing one of the images from the
original png.

Getting feedback from this client is close to impossible, so I just
buckled down and placed the 30 shoddy .jpg images on top of the .png

I actually was *not* able to get it pushed online, but I uploaded the
.png and my .xcf (Gimp) file up to Redmine.

Right *now* I'm on 東横線 headed to 中目黒 for a Japanese meetup.  I
guess I should switch my head to 日本語モード、だね。

ちょっとドキドキですけどしょうがない、勉強しなきゃ！
