I was a minute late to A and C's lesson, but they were 5 and 20 minutes
late, respectively.  whew!

We hadn't seen C in three weeks so I asked A to ask some questions
about C's latest adventures. I took notes on two separate sheets of
paper on which I made corrections and then had them do the same
conversation again, but using the new phrases.  I hope it was helpful!

At the end, each student got their own page with corrections.
