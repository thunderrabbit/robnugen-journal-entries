Spent 6 hours working on AB site, planning for how to migrate them to
their new server(s) (web + DB).  That was while emailing S about some
problem with server running out of memory.  That ain't good.  I
boosted the allowed memory in config file, but would love to figure
out what the actual problem is (more precisely than there's a lotta
records!)
