    HI Sam
    
    On this URL: https://my.atlassian.com/products/index

    I see a sideways "Leave Feedback" button (div) on the right side
	of my browser.
    
    I wanted to leave feedback that the processes for creating license
	keys for SourceTree took about 15 or 20 seconds, which I think is
	slow enough that people might give up and stop using your product.
    
    BUT, when I clicked on Leave Feedback, the window that appears
	only has space for name and email.  I click [submit] and it gives
	an error message:
    
    Oops! Something went wrong...
    Value of summary field is either missing or too long.
	You must specify a summary of the issue.
    Don't worry though! We've logged this problem and will look into it soon!
    
    Before this experience, I had the impression that Atlassian and
    all its products were great, rock solid, etc etc.  I really like
	the Atlassian brand.  But now I'm like O_o.
    
    - Rob!
