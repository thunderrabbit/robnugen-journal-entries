I finished my
[livemd5 cheater](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/live-md5-command-line-cheater);
it went more smoothly than I expected!

In just tens of seconds it can spew hundreds of strings with md5 (hex)
hashes which regex match any three digits at the end of the string
e.g. /123$/

Too bad everyone else has nearly abandoned the
[md5sum live count](http://www.reddit.com/live/thjep4nr9895)!
