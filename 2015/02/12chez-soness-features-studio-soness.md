Headed to Chez Soness to help her record some videos for her latest
project/product.  Cool stuff!

Fun times!  We had lunch and converted Chez Soness into Studio Soness
and then recorded several takes of her latest
[Show-n-Tell US](http://show-n-tell.us) video.  Dogs and jets
augmented the soundtrack after we got her script tweaked.  Try again
tomorrow!

Now I'm headed to first lesson in Akihabara, which should become a
weekly event.

D'oh!  This train terminates in Shinagawa.

yay!  I got a seat on the next train leaving Shinagawa.
