Hmmm!  I received a request on Fiverr from a guy asking for a maze on
a postcard to be mailed to his friend.

He suggested a maze like the one I made for a guy on Reddit (no
internet access to find the link right now), which starts in the
center and then has four arms radiating outward in different
directions.

The latest request was to make the maze on the card look like a small
part of a larger maze.

So now I'm thinking it would be neat to make a set of postcards which
together make up a maze.  Could create a pair of cards with a start
and end on each card, or any number of cards that fit together to make
a full maze!

I'm not sure how people would *use* them, so I don't think it would
make a particularly popular product, but it could be fun!
