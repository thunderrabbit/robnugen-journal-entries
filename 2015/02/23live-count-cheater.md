Today I made a repo to help find particular md5 strings for
[Counting with md5sum](http://www.reddit.com/live/thjep4nr9895).  It's
my
[live md5 command line cheater](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/live-md5-command-line-cheater).

Also gave
[10000 bit tip to a man](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitTippers/comments/2wthev/parenthood_giveaway/cou3aof)
who
[announced his wife was pregnant](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitTippers/comments/2wthev/parenthood_giveaway/http://www.reddit.com/r/BitTippers/comments/2wthev/parenthood_giveaway/).

And am working on a maze for Angelos, and printed a logo for a photo
at Shibuya Crossing tomorrow.

Okay good night!
