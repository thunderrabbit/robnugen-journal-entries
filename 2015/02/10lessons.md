Today I had three more hours of lessons than I normally have on
Tuesdays.  In addition to Akabanebashi and Mutsumis, I taught at
Toshiba near Kawasaki station.  It worked out well because Lin took
today off work and we got to chow lunch at Lazona after I finished at
2pm.

After lunch, we smooched and I headed to Ebisu to chill with Nate for
a bit.  He bought a new cute+cool domain that I haven't set up yet,
but will soon.  It's just for Redmine installation which is already
set up on Linode so no biggie.

I went to toy shop, but they were chatting with "real" customers so I
didn't stay long.

Oh I didn't mention last week when I went in, one of the employees
asked me to show her the secret to a four-piece wooden puzzle.  I had
solved it two weeks prior, after the other employees and customers had
given up on it.  At that time, I had thought *gimme dat*, but was
like, 「できる、できる」 "I can do it" and solved it just before I had
to go.  So anyway, last week, I solved it in a trice.  "Like this"
*shjoop* done.
