Amazingly, someone spoke to me about my bare feet.  It was great to be
addressed in Japanese, and to basically be able to handle the
conversation.  Just a couple words I didn't know (maybe かど or
something with こ) which she explained meant something like people
talking (to me, like she, about my being barefoot).
