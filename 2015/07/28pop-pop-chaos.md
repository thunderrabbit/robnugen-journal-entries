Lin suggested the name a couple days ago.  I had called it Pop Pop Pop
and described the game.  Everyone's touching / clicking bubbles at the
same time.  She goes, "it's pop chaos!" and I was like, "yep!" and
immediately changed the title of the app to Pop Pop Chaos.

("Pop Chaos" sounds like "Pop music" but it's not popular chaos; it's
pop pop chaos like popping bubbles!)

Today I finished the first and second alpha versions of the game!

So, feel free to check out
[Pop Pop Chaos](https://poppopchaos.meteor.com/), live on
[meteor.com](https://www.meteor.com).

It still seems a bit buggy so I'll try to sort out what's going on
with it tonight and tomorrow かな.

Hmmm; I better grab poppopchaos on Twitter.  I'm not ready to buy the
domain name yet though.

Oh!  We can use our custom domains, so heck yeah I'll buy it!  Gotta
zoom home to internet access first.

I rode home from Kawasaki station in 10 minutes.  Actually ten minutes
from the platform to our house.  Maybe 11.  zoom!  bought poppopchaos.com
