ed. note: This entry is crap; do not waste time reading it!


Been going through Learning how to Learn, and just finished the video
on
[Chunks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/LurUJ/what-is-a-chunk),
the first thing I didn't "know" already.

After the video, they posed a prompt:

    To allow you to better chunk the meaning of chunk, pause and recall,
    then write your best synthesis description here of the meaning of
    "chunking."

I answered this answer that's sooo hilarious I just had to put it here.

    "best synthesis description" isn't language that was used in the
    video, that I can recall, so it seems a bit distracting here.
    But, Barbara has not yet chunked the concepts of putting on a jacket
    while speaking her lines in front of a camera; they're still distinct
    actions for her.
    I'm considering chunking this answer and starting anew, but that's
    just my focused brain editing while my diffuse brain is putting some
    chunks of information on the page.  My wife has just texted me so we
    can go on a date, so see ya chumps later!
