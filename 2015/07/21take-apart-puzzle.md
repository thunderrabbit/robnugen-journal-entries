Hmm! There are several metal two-piece take-apart puzzles at the toy
store.  There are a couple that I can solve in a trice, and one which
I can solve, but takes a bit of fiddling.

That was my mistaken thought until today.  Turns out I *hadn't* fully
solved it!  I think!

The puzzle consists of two triangularly coiled "nails," each with
three curves.  One curve is about 90 degrees, the other is about 50
degrees, and the last goes 180 degrees (as the head of the nail curves
into the interior like a paper clip) (I should have taken a picture!!)

I *thought* linking the nails from their 180 degree turns was the
point furthest from start, a claim further supported by the puzzles
being shipped in that configuration (I think).

BUT, one of the puzzles had the two pieces linked at the 45 degree
bend, and I couldn't get them out of that configuration in the same
amount of time that I thought I fully solved the other version!  Holy
cats!  Is the 45 degree angle the end point??
