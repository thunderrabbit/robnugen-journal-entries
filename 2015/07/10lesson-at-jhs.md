Just finished lunch with Kazu, Tony, Tomomi, Stuart, and Tyrell at a
pizza place apparently rated the 2nd best pizza in Tokyo.  I thought
it was as good as CPK, but not as good as Star Pizza (of course!?)  I
had a four cheese pizza to myself, while the others shared things with
spicey sauce, tomatos, meat, more meat, and some sea food.

Lesson featured 9 students (of ten on my roster), with little or no
class interaction.  Pretty difficult for me so I hope to remember not
to do lessons for junior high school students without a bit of
training first!

One student put his head down several times, though he was actually
one of the most capable in the class, so I guess he was bored.
