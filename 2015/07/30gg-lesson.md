Talking about puzzles near the end of our lesson, I remembered the
word puzzles with five houses, five owners, five colors, five pets,
and five jobs.

Several clues are given and then the question: "Who likes fishing?"
can be solved with a little logic.

SO, I attempted to create such a puzzle for GG, but with only 3 houses
because I only had 5 minutes to do it:

* There are three houses, three nationalities, and three pets.
* The Canadian lives next to the dog owner.
* The American lives in the green house.
* The owner of the blue house has a fish.
* The fish is not next to the Frenchman's house.
* The owner of the red house is French.
* The dog lives in the middle house.
* Who owns the cat?

Now, the huge caveat: I don't know if this can be solved.  I have a
feeling the details of the neighborhood cannot be completely solved
because there's no indication of left vs right.

How does one prove if this kind of question has the correct number of
clues?

In other news, I showed them Pop Pop Chaos after the lesson.  M was
interested but T was not, and A was like, "I don't have a computer or
a smartphone."

I love A. Today she told me she doesn't have AC.  Awesome!
