Thanks Koichi!

I think I'm in the honeymoon of conscious incompetence.

I've been doing Anki each day as your book suggests, at 5am as your
book suggests, and I've got between 70 and 100 cards queued up each
day.  My latest progress is visible at http://www.robnugen.com (if you
don't see any Japanese entries in the top page, it may mean progress
has stopped progressing!)

At this point, I've cracked into the cards starting with 真っ

1. 真っ赤　まっか 　pure red
1. 真っ暗　まっくら　pitch dark
1. 真っ黒　まっくろ　pitch black


and those are okay, but these

1. 苦い　にがい　bitter
2. 若い　わかい　young
3. 迷惑　めいわく annoying  the kanji for bitter and young are annoying!
4. 面倒　めんどう troublesome
5. 無知　むち　ignorant
6. 無駄　むだ　wasteful
7. 無料　むり　impossible

are makin' me crazy!

How do you like squarespace?  How'd you make your [TextFugu stickers](http://store.tofugu.com/shop/sticker-pack-combo-pack?category=Goods)?  I want to do a similar thing with my mazes http://www.amazeaweek.net/ but blah blah blah

- Rob!

ps:  who the hell ever thought two kanji for one word would be a good idea?  Can you imagine if they used three kanji in one word?  Jeez!!  (shhhh don't tell him)
