Nice.  So I just set up Emacs on Tariq's computer with a few clicks of
the keyboard including commands like

    cd ~/.emacs.d
    git clone git@bitbucket.org:thunderrabbit/emacs-shiz.git personal --recursive

For some reason Markdown didn't get set, but all my other journal creation
code did so that's pretty nice.
