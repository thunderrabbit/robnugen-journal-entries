Oh my gosh wow!!!  I like watching construction so I often take
pictures of construction sites.  Today I was having a gander at new
building construction near 金沢八景駅 and I noticed a big digger thing
suspended over a large vertical tube.  Then I noticed the tube was
slowly rotating!

I started taking video with Periscope (so it's online now, even before
this message is written) and stepped over a fence, which gained the
attention from an *English speaking* security guard!  He explained
that it was in fact a large post hole digger, but not for a building..
They're going to *extend the Seaside Line* to 金沢八景駅!!!

Right now, the two stations are a few hundred meters apart, but all
that is going to change... within a couple years, I guess!!  The
Seaside Line's existing 金沢八景駅 will be demolished and the trains
will go the extra 200 meters to help people be lazy!  Yayyy!!???
