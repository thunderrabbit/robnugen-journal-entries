Hmm!  Soness texted me after I texted her HI!

    Hi! On periscope in
    1 min. Join or chat
    later ok? Xoxo

Wait what?  What's periscope?  Probably some autocorrect mistake.

I looked it up cause I couldn't think of what she might have meant
otherwise, and, well, periscope is Periscope, an app with which we can
"broadcast" live video from our mobile devices.

I downloaded the app on way home from Apple Store and broadcase My
Bare Feet while walking up stairs to get Lin's bicycle.  Then while on
Seaside Line, I broadcast that.

I haven't watched the Seaside Line one yet, but the broadcast
maintained a huge advance in retain rate, over a million bajillion
times higher than 0% I had before: 3%!!
