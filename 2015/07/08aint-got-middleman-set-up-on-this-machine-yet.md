And Emacs app with its own window isn't working either.  I'm using
Emacs within Terminal window via command line.  Only bummer is not
being able to point and click with mouse to move the point.

No internet access now, but I may try to install Middleman on here or
I *might* try to install Hugo (is that the fast one?) which I didn't
fully finish testing on Debian box before.
