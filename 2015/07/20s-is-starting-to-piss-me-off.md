Lin knows this girl M whose ex boyfriend S doesn't get the hint that he
should stop calling M. I've gotten the hint many times with many
different girls and women.  Cry, get a grip, move on.

He's pissing me off because he's now wasting *my* time with Lin
because he's called Lin cause M won't answer the phone and doesn't
want to talk to him anymore.

I would give him a good what for, but he only speaks languages I don't
speak.

Lin just hung up with S.

Is there a suicide hotline in Tokyo?  He says he's going to kill
himself, and I essentially give 0 fucks.

Okay, I gave one; I sent him a
[Japan-based suicide hotline number](https://www.suicide.org/hotlines/international/japan-suicide-hotlines.html).
I found it in English, but hopefully it's valid for Japanese as well.
