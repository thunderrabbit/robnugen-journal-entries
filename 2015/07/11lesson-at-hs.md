## 09:44 Saturday 11 July 2015 JST

I had the smart idea of making teams to create and ask questions
instead of just boring-lecturing today's topic.  Two team captains
self-selected and then chose the first 2 peeps on their team, and then
I arbitrarily divided the rest so there would be no last person
selected.

## 11:50am

During the third hour, in which we were asked to talk about the new
WTC complex, I spoke about the events on the day.  What happened?
Plane hit building.  Right. Then what happened?  Plane hit other
building.  Right. Then what happened to the buildings?  Collapse.
Right.  So how many buildings collapsed?  Two. Okay, and you guys,
what do you think?  Two. 

ブッブー  [buzzer onomatopoeia]  Three.

I was glad to see the surprise register on some of the students'
faces.

I just touched on the easy points of the story: fire caused
symmetrical collapse; firefighters knew it would collapse before it
did.  BBC knew about the collapse before it did. Silverstein's big
insurance premium.  Planes have wings.  trillions announced lost the
day before, Enron SEC filings in third tower.

Anyway, I then went through the prescribed material about the new
complex: 4 WTC designed by some guy; 1 WTC is 541 meters tall;
reflecting pools are in footprints of towers; etc etc boring junk.

Class ended and I confirmed they remembered the search term WTC 7.
