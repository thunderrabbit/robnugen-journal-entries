Next to some train tracks with Lin, I wanted to hop on the next train
to see where it would go, but we needed to go somewhere.  The next
train tat came through stoped so I could watch and actually split some
cars off and sent them toward a deep rock quarry with limestone
boulders precariously falling from the other side and occasionally
bouncing onto tis side.  A guy on the train rode his bicycle down th
square spiralled tracks and narrowly missed being crushed by a
limestone boulder.  I did the same (not be crushed) by watching the
boulders peel away from the other side, and predicting their paths
while they were in the air  after looping down and back up.

Superman and Batman were at odds; Batman was the good guy, but
Superman was helping the bad guy destroy the city by flying his jet
directly down into the ground and having the despondent guy fly down
alongside him, but Batman realized in time and flew to catch the plane
and diverted it upwrrd and then unarguably changed the course of
history.   We just don't know from what.

After the jet was diverted to crash not in the city, I was sitting on
a hilltop looking for it.  Somewone had super-zoomed my cameras and
found it, so I becan to showe people as I zoomed out. after I had seen
the pilot alive and well, though in a destroyed plane.
