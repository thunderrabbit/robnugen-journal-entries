For our fourth anniversary, we went to a climbing gym near our house.
Lin told all her co-workers how romantic I am and she thought of the
idea and researched the location.

We had a fun climbing and watching a young boy be taught how to climb
(and respect his teacher).

I got a few rips on my fingers from gripping the easy level grips on
the walls which ranged from 85 degrees to 120 degrees.  I couldn't do
much on the 120 degree wall.  Basically nothing really.

I'm not 100% sure I'm glad I "had to" wear climbing shoes, but my feet
probably would have gotten injured had I not.
