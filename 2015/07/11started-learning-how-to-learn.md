I started the [Learning how to
Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/outline)
course on Coursera this morning, and was able to correctly answer most
of the questions without watching the videos.  I queued three videos
to watch while out at Higashi-Nakano today, but forgot my earphones,
so might not be able to (unless I do it between lessons, which I
might).
