Nice time walking around with Paola and Jon after eating in Sendagay
at a Japanese restaurant with an American sounding employee who gave us
her recommendation for seaweed pizza: nori and mayo basically, but
pretty good!

We went to eat ice cream after dinner and there appened to be a
MiniStop just down the street so we got Hagen Daaz and then walked
toward Harajuku by way of the building where I teach Mutsumis, and the
toy store I frequent before those lessons.

Though the store had closed at 7pm, they were nice enough to do あいさつ with us
at 8pm for a few minutes and the guy was like, "Robu!" when he saw me
while opening the door to tell Lin they were closed.  He went and got
まいちゃん as well and we said HI etc for a few minutes and then I was
like, "well sorry to intrude" (お邪魔しました) and they waved bye as
we left.

Then we walked through another shrine thing to bypass most of 竹下通
and hopped on 山の手 line in Harajuku.  There was a cute girl with
face-framing bangs, and lips which reminded me a lot of SBK which is
really interesting cause I just had the dream about her a couple days
ago.

Paola and Jon got off the train in Shibuya so we said bye to them and
I expected the cute girl to get off there as well, but she stayed on
the train even longer than us, so I said *see ya never* in my head as
we got off in 品川.  We got seats on Tokaido Line (Tokyo Ueno Line)
and I wrote this entry in the notebook I bought to write work notes
after swimming.
