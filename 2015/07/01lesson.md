Lesson was good; same company, but new class with seven students, who
were willing to use the idea I got from my Spanish teacher back in the
day: use a new target-language name... basically take a new name, move
to a new city, get a new job.  So I'm Rob from Sydney, and, to honor
my Spanish teacher having been a payaso, am a clown.
