I finaly came up with a simple game idea and have spent the last few
days coding it up in Meteor.

I spoke with Travis and Johan a bit yesterday about it, and I've
decided to use some of their ideas.  Last player gets the points, and
the last play is determined randomly, tending toward the max, but not
necessarily the max.

I haven't coded that up; I don't have a good feel for the probability
function that will make it work the way I'd like.
