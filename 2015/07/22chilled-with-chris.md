Yesterday Chris and I were both a bit later than normal leaving our
lesson so we missed the train that we usually take.  The next train
comes 5 minutes later, but due to his train connections, Chris arrives
home 21 minutes later if he takes it.

I was like, "I ain't gonna run, but feel free to if you like.  OR, we
can chill at the (next) station!"

Turns out the trains at the next station were late anyway, so chillin
was a great option!

I mentioned MJG's next book The Lost (which I'm pre-reading now), and
Chris told me about his book/blog idea which I think could work!  I
told him I'll bug him about it to encourage its development.
