Nice lessons with Y and M today.  Y is getting better at speaking,
though sometimes I wonder if I push her too hard.  Muchan always does
great homework so it's a lovely breeze to help her out because she has
tons of material to check and practice, though she's loathe to speak,
so I usually just end up checking her homework.
