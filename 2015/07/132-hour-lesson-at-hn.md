Taught for two hours at HN today; the students were a bit(!) more
talkative today on day 3 of 5.  Even Takeo said something without
being directly prompted!

Rin showed me that he had done some research on 9/11, and came up with
the summary, [怖](http://www.kanjidamage.com/kanji/1096-scary-%E6%80%96)い　（こわい）. I was like "yep"

But I gave him the name [Zeitgeist](http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/) to balance out [Loose Change](http://www.loosechange911.com/), which I
wrote after [Operation Northwoods](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=operation+northwoods) and [Gulf of Tonkin](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=gulf+of+tonkin+incident).
