Taught for two hours at HN today; the students were a bit(!) more
talkative today on day 3 of 5.  Even Takeo said something without
being directly prompted!

Rin showed me that he had done some research on 9/11, and came up with
the summary, 強い　（こわい）. I was like "yep"

But I gave him the name Zeitgeist to balance out Loose Change, which I
wrote after Operation Northwoods and Gulf of Tonkin.
