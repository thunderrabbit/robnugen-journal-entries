I violated my vow to not buy any more Apple hardware when I bought a
DVI to VGA adapter so I can use my monitor with Tariq's laptop, which
doesn't have HDMI.  Breaking my vow was totally worth it though; I got
to meet a really nice employee who was so cute I couldn't think of
what to say!!  She brought back two lovely ten yen coins as part of my
change and said she selected them for me, though I hadn't mentioned
that I'd like them.  But, I did!  I do!  AND they're from year 23, so
four years ago.  wow!  She asked if I collect coins from other
countries, and I said I had collected coins in the US, but dang I
didn't think to ask her if she collected coins as well.  I did learn
she's from California, from a city whose name I won't mention, but was
small enough that I hadn't previously heard it.  Anyway, she was
really cute and nice and she's マイブーム for now.

I figure there's a 20% chance I'll see her when I go into the store to
get my computer back.  If that happens, I'll tell her thanks for the
coins and ask if she collects them as well.
