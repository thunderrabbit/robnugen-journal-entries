My tonsils hurt a bit yesterday, so I did neti and gargled with warm
salt water, drank loads of orange juice and went to bed as soon as I
got home.  Still felt a bit ooky this morning so I went to a clinic
near our house.  Thanks to rain, there weren't many people in the
waiting room, so I got checked (red tonsils, slight fever), prescribed
(antibiotics for 6 days (which I will finish perfectly)), billed (1200
yen), and outta there pretty quickly.

Slept more, this time with Jennie, and am now headed to lesson for JB
down near 八景島シーパラダイス.
