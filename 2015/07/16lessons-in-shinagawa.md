I taught two lessons in Shinagawa.  First was a private lesson where I
asked questions about her hobby: birdwatching. She seems pretty
dedicated to birdwatching and was pretty good speaking once she spoke,
but seemed really shy.

Second lesson featured two chatty women, who were relatively low, but
really tried hard.  I know logically this is what I need to do to
improve my Japanese: speak, speak, speak, and speak!
