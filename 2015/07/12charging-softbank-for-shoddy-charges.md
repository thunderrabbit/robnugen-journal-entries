Lin and I went to softbank to inquire about charges for her iPad whose
contract was up last year or so.

They helpfully renewed the contract and charge a fucking fee to get
out of it. So while sitting there listening to him explain how it was
impossible to do anything about it even though we didn't use the
service, I folded one of their A4 size laminated ads, deflated their
laptop sized mascot (didn't poke a hole in it, but I thought about
it), and changed the calendar from July to *October*.

Long way to go before even steven, but that's all the stuff I could
reach.
