I learned something about CB site after pushing a change to live
server: I need to test the mobile (and touch) sites locally as well.
I had tested the main site but not the others, so the usability team
tested them for me.

Errors poured in over night, but my phone was in quiet mode cause I
wanted to sleep so I didn't notice until morning.  Texted with Andrew
a bit to get it sorted, and got it sorted.
