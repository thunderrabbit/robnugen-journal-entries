I don't remember how I did this on the Debian box, and can't seem to
quickly find notes, but here are new notes.

I downloaded Netbeans from
http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk-nb/8u45-8.0.2/jdk-8u45-nb-8_0_2-macosx-x64.dmg

but it doesn't have PHP as an option when I click New Project, so I'm going to try downoading
http://download.netbeans.org/netbeans/8.0.2/final/bundles/netbeans-8.0.2-php-macosx.dmg

~~Crud.  That didn't seem to help.~~

That worked after restarting Netbeans!   I wonder if I didn't need to
download the second thing and just needed to restart Netbeans...

Headed to Mutsumis' lessons now.
