<p class="dream">
With SBK and her twin sister, we had a big bed together and I got to
sleep with both at the same time, with the door open, and we heard
some noise during fellatio with SBK twin, so I got up and bumped the
door closed without leaving the bed and came back and SBK began
fellatio and I joked like "hey you're cutting in line; let's kiss," and
twin went back to fellatio and I kissed SBK for a few seconds,
relishing the moment until it changed as Steve came over to put away
his blanket, and I considered gently rushing him out, but I hadn't
seen him in a while so I said he could just put the blanket anywhere
would be fine.  Unfortunately the moment with twins had passed and I
went looking for them, but found only  some people who wanted to have
me proofread an article, and I laughed at the note about the author
having received 892,023? (just under 900,000, I rememeber) text messaged
correctoons or nquiries hahah so that's why they didn't reply
</p>

then my alarm went off.
