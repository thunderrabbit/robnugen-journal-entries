<p class=date>Late late Friday Dec 27, 1991</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p>I'm mostly caught up on the house & the budget.  I forgot to log
one check of mine, so that's on hold for a while (until my next
statement)

<p>Tomorrow I'm going to play racquetball with Mr Bandecca.  That will
be cool.  Later.  Love Rob
