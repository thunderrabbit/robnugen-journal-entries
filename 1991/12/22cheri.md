<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p>Cheri is on the phone with me & bawling her eyes out about John
Baker, the "Jerk off" (cheri said it).  Well she was crying but she's
happy now.

<p>We're planning to go to the zoo and we just determined that we've
known each other since 1986.  Cool, man.
