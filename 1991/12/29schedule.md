<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p>I was beaten soundly by Mr Bandecca 4 or 5 games in a row.  I kinda
felt bad, since he had commented about how he wanted a workout, not to
just piss around..  He was very nice about it, and I believe sincere
when he said he enjoyed playing.  That's cool.

<p>Last night I got a call from Cheri, who said she was going out with
some guy who's 31, apparently a real charmer, he's made comments about
her nice blonde hair & "good proportions" and commented that he'd like
to take pictures of her.  Shit.  I told her absolutely NOT to go out
with him.  I begged her.  I told her that if she stood him up, I would
come out there "right now" and take her out wherever she wanted to go.
My pleading didn't work, so I told her at least to call me when she
got back.  She agreed to that, and she did call me back.  I was quite
glad to hear that she was OK.  I was pretty snoozy when we talked, but
I remember that she went to his apartment, but he didn't make any
moves on her.  I told her how much I care about her and that I was so
glad that she survived.

<p>This morning when I got up, I noted that someone cracked my lower
right office windows.  - I guess that's my office's lower right
window.  Anyway, it looks like a rock hit it or a b-b gun.  Stupid ass
people.

<p>Today, I did the laundry and worked on Laura's letter.  The written
portion of it is finished - I simply need to put in my letter inserts.
I'm giving her several 1969 pennies, but I need to tape them to a
sheet so that they won't bunch up in a corner.  We have no scotch
tape, though.  I finished up her letter with the words to <em>Now</em>
by Edie Brickel & New Bohemians.  Then I wrote "that about sums it up.
I miss you.  Much Love - Rob" I hope she likes it.  What am I
saying?!? of course she'll like it.  On to a new subject...

<p>Tammy got her hair sliced while she was gone.  She got a huge make
up kit, too.  She was acting a lot like her mom when she got back.  So
far today she has spent about (1) one minute interacting with me since
we got back from the airport.  It's weird having her back; all her
stuff is all over the place, she's spent 3 hours on the computer and
about 2 on the phone.  Heh- I guess she won't mind if I got fuck
whoever I want.  Maybe Anne Meek from the ER at work.  Ann(e)(?) is a
tall big girl, 21 years old, big smile with braces, great eyes, long
brown hair.  Mmmm.  I will definitely interact with her once I'm free
of Tammy.

<p>Oh, one other cool thing.  While Tammy was gone, I kinda worked on
the Buckminster Fuller sleep schedule.  Awake 3.5 hours, sleep .5
hours over and over.  I believe that I did it once.  No great feat
really, but I had been awake a few hours, then I lay in bed & dosed
for a bit (never actually fell into deep sleep) and then woke up
refreshed.  Now that I think about it, it seems like no big deal, less
than that even.  Oh well.  Sometime I will work to keep that schedule
up for a long while.  It's just hard to do it in today's society.  I
guess if I really planned it out, I could do it for a little while.
Something like...  Dude!  The pharmacy is about to close on
Saturdays.. I could do it Let me get my school schedule.  Hang on.  Ok
- I have requested that I work on Mon, Wed & Fri from about 2 to 9:30.

<p>HOLY MOLY.  That would work!  And so easily, too!  The only tough
part would be getting ready for work and napping between school on
Mon, Wed, & Fri.  I would simply have to bring my work clothes to
school.  Oh my gosh - the implications of pulling this off would be
fantastic!  If I pull this off, it's 3 hours of sleep per day.  Just
think what I could do with all that extra time!!! Will it work?  We
shall see.  I would need to get some sort of timer that I would set.
Hmmm.  This would be great.  If necessary, I could catch up on the
weekends.  Whoah ..

<p>This schedule does assume that I can get my 'job' donating sperm.
I would have 20 hours per week at St. Joseph, and and extra $200 per
month from sperm donation.  More than enough to cover everything.  If
I can't get the sperm job, I'll have to get a weekend job.  We shall
see within a few weeks.  Later
