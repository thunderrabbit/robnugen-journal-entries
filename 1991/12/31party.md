<p class=date>7:50AM Morning New Year's Eve 1991</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p>We're here.  We got here at about 2AM & we all stayed up for
probably 2 hours talking about programming & music and listening to
music.  Looking out the window, I see the sky is entirely gray.  The
ocean is about 150 or 200 yards away (wrong 50 yards only)

<p class=date>It's now 11AM or so.</p>

<p>I went to the beach and got some cool shells.  I met Danny &
Phyllis, Devin's parents.  They are really cool.  I walked around with
Danny for a while before anyone else was up.  There's a field next
door to the house with cattle in it.  Pretty interesting.  Right now
we're listening to music: <em>Ned's Atomic Dustbin</em>. Cool group
name, eh?
