<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p>I'm working on my new sleep schedule.  I have to be at work at 9AM.
Tammy and I had great sex at about 11PM last night.  I slept until
1:30AM, when I woke up & took a shower.  I'm kinda groggy right now,
but we'll see how it goes.  I intend to sleep at 4AM until 6:30AM when
Tammy wakes up.  Then I'll take a short nap at 8AM.  Then work & take
a nap during lunch.  We'll see how it goes.

<p class=date>3:50AM</p>

<p>I've been writing to Maggie & Molly.  I'm about to go to sleep now.  Let me just put all this stuff away.

<p class=date>7:50PM</p>

<p>Well, it didn't quite work out.  I was unable to make myself get up at 6:30AM with Tammy.  I snoozed until 8AM..  Right now, Caleb & Devin are at Adam's beach house.  I called them, and apparently Adam & family aren't out there, yet.  I called Adam's house & asked if he'd call me back before he goes out.  He might pick me up on the way out there.  That would be really cool, since I'd enjoy going.  So I'm writing this & to Maggie & Molly waiting for his possible call.

<p>He just called and said no prob to picking me up.  However, he said
it will be late.  So - who knows when... I finished Maggie's & Molly's
letters.  I sent them each a personal one, and then a combined letter
that I turned into a jigsaw puzzle & split the pieces into each
envelope.  That should be fun for them.  I just now payed the rent,
and I've got about $200 in my account.  Not amazing, but at least I
didn't have to write it in red ink.  Later.

<p>Tammy just got home & I told her.  I'm outside waiting for Adam.
