<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p>I'm at home for lunch right now.  I parked at a parking meter under
Pierce Elevated.  I put enough money in for 9 hours.  When I went to
lunch, so that no one could use my time, I put a brown bag that said,
"Out Of Order" over the meter.  Pretty sneaky...

<p>I got a picture of Joy today.  It is so so beautiful - taken
outside with leaves and trees everywhere.  Very nice.  Later  Love Rob

<p><b>Fuck Shit God Damn My nose has been fucking pissing me off all day !!!!!!</b>

<p>I called Laura's house, but she's working until 2AM.  She'll call
me back at that time.  It's 9:42 now.  Later.  Oh - I'm fucking going
to bed.  I've been cleaning the house slowly & deliberately.  Cool.
