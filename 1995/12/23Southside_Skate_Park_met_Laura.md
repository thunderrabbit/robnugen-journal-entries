<h1>Merry Christmas!</h1>

<p>This is actually my latest skating adventure, from which I just
returned and am still feeling the effects.  I went to Southside Skate
Park (I think that's what it's called) and for the first time I skated
some half pipes and vert ramps.  This is also the first time I've done
any ramp skating since my accident over a year ago.</p>

<p>They opened at 11pm and a bunch of people were already waiting.
There was only one, maybe two people older than me.  Her name is Laura
(that makes like 18 for those who are keeping track) and the guy who
might be older is Ed, the best best all-around skater in Houston.</p>

<p>It was Laura's first time to skate off her neighborhood sidewalks; I was
impressed with her guts.  She and I went first to the smaller half pipe and
just stood there watching the guys skate it.  Most of them were about
14 to 18 years old, and there were two 10-year-olds who were pretty skilled
on the ramps.</p>

<p>So we watched and then were like, "hey, if they can do it, then we,
both being gymnasts, can certainly do it."  So we rolled down many
times and with lots of repetition we both got to the point where we
could skate down one side and up the other side to standing.  Cool.
<br>I am realizing my story has no real thrills to describe except
personal growth through practice and many bruises.  I busted both
elbows (need to get elbow pads) and my right hip and both shins.  But
by the end of the night, I was able to skate down the much bigger half
pipe and do a couple of passes on it.  Pretty cool.</p>

<p>The moral is practice practice practice and you can do whatever you
want.</p>

<p>Have fantastic holidays.</p>

<p>Much Love
<br>- Rob<p>
