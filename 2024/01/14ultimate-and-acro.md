Last week weather was chilly and still good turnout for SOGO Ultimate.
My co-worker Zach joined us.  He's good!  Great catches and awareness
of how to play.  He must have been on a competitive team before.

Mike's sister Linda and her friend Chloe also joined us so we had a
pretty good turnout overall.

We played until tree shadows covered our field.  Acro yoga peeps were
still going, so we headed over there and did a few poses.  Good times!
