There was a kid at Bondi Beach who dug a hole in the sand deeper than he was tall.  I didn't take a photo because he's a kid, but he inspired me to dig, so I did.

In other news, the waves were again amazing today. For the last few days there's been a quite a deep section right where the waves reach the shore and then shallow for about 20 or 30 meters before it gets deep again.

There were a few terrific waves today which ruffled up a lot of sand in the deeper portion of the water, so that was pretty neat.
