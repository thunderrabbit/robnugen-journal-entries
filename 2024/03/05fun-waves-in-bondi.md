Today in Bondi Beach I enjoyed large waves with lots of other swimmers, some of whom I contacted (*) due to Mother Nature's raw power and unpredictability.

(*) leg on shoulder, etc

A couple of times I talked briefly with other swimmers.  The funniest of these was:

me: "Woah it's wild today!"
<br>she: "Yeah but it's fun!"
<br>wave: (incoming)
<br>she: "oh shit"

After that wave, we were some meters apart.
