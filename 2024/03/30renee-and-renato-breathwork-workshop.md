Thank you Renee and Renato for an amazing experience.  I've done
breathwork before, but not had so much experiential impact from
breathwork every before.  Probably the sheer length of the session (45
minutes?) of in-in-out breathing.  My hands and feet were tingling as
if I had just arrived back in my body from astral traveling.

After the session, I felt so alive and so much love for the container
and for Jess having introduced me and attending as well.  So great to
sit with Jess after we helped Renee and Renato pack up their elaborate
setup, including alatr, lights, drum set, various instruments, and
yoga mats, blankets, pillows, and eye masks for each participant.
Such a great event!

Thank You God for I am joyfully receiving heart-aligned abundance,
serving soul-aligned clients.
