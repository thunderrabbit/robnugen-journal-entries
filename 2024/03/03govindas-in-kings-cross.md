Printed five of my A5 flyers, then put one into the outdoor basket of a crystal shop.

We ate at Govindas after 1.5 hour walk to and from Coogee.

Nice buffet featuring deep fried cauliflower and then ice cream yum!

Next Bob Marley movie from 19:30

Great movie; very inspiring and wow Bob Marley was only 36 when he died.  Amazing.

Thank you Jess for recommending Govindas!

Wow Jess helped me find the iconic King's Cross fountain I remember from my family trip to OZ in 1985!

The Hilton hotel is still here too!
