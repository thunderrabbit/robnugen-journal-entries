Hmm very interesting to hear the dangers and ineffectiveness of root canal treatments.  Removing my molar doesn't sound like what I wanted but true enough, there's an abscess under one of my teeth that got a root canal many years ago.

Dr Howard's main point seems to be ya cannot possibly clean all the bacteria from the 6-10 kilometers of micro tubal nerve canals, just 8 bacteria wide.

Sealing that shit inside eventually causes the bacteria to "morph"(?) into anaerobic bacteria which causes damage etc etc blah blah blah.

🤔 Hmmm
