Hello Family and Friends...

I am back in the states after my 7 month trip to Southern Mexico where I
spent mid July until December learning from and photographing the
incredible uprising occurring in Oaxaca followed by two months in Chiapas.
In Olympia this week, through photos, video clips, and stories, I hope to
share the spirit and creativity of the teachers strike turned full scale
popular rebellion that managed to take control of the city for multiple
months demanding the resignation of the corrupt state governor, Ulises
Ruiz Ortiz. My presentation will cover the reality that led to the
uprising, the media and government building takeovers, the 1,800
neighborhood barricades, the formation of the Popular Assembly of the
Peoples of Oaxaca (APPO), and the brutal repression and assassinations of
movement members at the hands of paramilitaries and police. Witnessing
this diverse movement in Oaxaca has left me truly inspired and
re-energized. In the face of grave government repression the people of
Oaxaca are continuing this struggle and in great need of international
solidarity.

For those of you in Olympia my presentation will occur twice this week...
