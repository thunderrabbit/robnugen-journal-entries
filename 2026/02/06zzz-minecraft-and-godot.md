Today I had a nice check-in call with a couple of friends and talked about my latest projects including the Minecraft
coordinate visualizer which my other friend who likes video games said was really cool. I will do a show and tell for
him tomorrow on the live Minecraft server so he can see the roller coaster that I made via screen share if not actually
being on the same server.

During that call, I found out that Godot is well-supported by AI, so I set up a new directory to have 4-year-old Godot 3 project get an upgrade to Godot 4.6.  I have a meeting with Tariq next weekish and I want to show him what I've done.

I also did some work for AB getting at least an hour of stuff done.
