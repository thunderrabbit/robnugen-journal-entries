#### 10:05 AM Friday 6 February 2026

So today I woke up around I guess 9:15 and then did meditation for a while using my meditation timer and also Sadhguru's timer [Miracle Of Mind](https://miracleofmind.sng.link/Aoy32/pnp0/r_124ae2a7e8)

After having read Kevin's book, [The Secret Fire of Alchemy](https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Fire-Alchemy-Kundalini-Shamanism/dp/B0CY9LKM98), I've been doing meditation more consistently, often going well beyond the 21 minute maximum within Sadhguru's app.

So I'm glad I have created my own meditation timer, Meiso Gambare at

I'm currently standing outside with about 50 to-do list items floating in my head after getting stuck on the link above:

Things to do (sometime in the mysterious future)

1. ✅ Tell my phone that when I type `mg` It should expand that out into `https://mg.robnugen.com/`
2. ✅ Make the unique link to my meditation (above) public.
When that's done it should show basically what's in this image:

3. ✅ Upload the above image that's currently just a screenshot on my phone showing 40:27 with a green background
4. ✅ Mention that means I meditated for 50 minutes because I started with 10 minutes for my countdown timer and it then counted up 40 minutes and 27 seconds
5. ✅ Pray 🙏, writing in BOOK TWENTY-NINE page 93
8. ✅ Fill in the page numbers in my journal (93-99)
13. 🕰️ Transfer my POVO eSIM to my new phone
12. ✅  Call Infinity Books to see if they still allow smoking in their bookstore
6. Invite people to my emotional awareness workshop and book launch party
7. ✅ Fix the link to my upcoming barefoot grounding event. I think it's broken because the title must be unique.
9. ✅ Copy this entry from my phone into my journal parsing LLM, Gemini via Google Antigravity
10. ✅ Message Jess (in London)
11. ✅ Call Yuki
14. ✅ Schedule a meeting with Tariq in Shinjuku next weekish

While standing outside in the sun, writing this journal entry, I saw my neighbor with her new old rescue dog, とろろ

#### 11:09

It's 11:09 a.m. now I'm going to finish writing on my phone and start doing some of the tasks above that are not yet done.
