I just finished my roller coaster in Minecraft on the Pure Vanilla public server.

I got a lot of help from Jordis00fed.

After it was finished, MRMAND was the first person to ride it. I had to give him membership in my chunk before he could ride it, so I may have to think about a different way to handle that and allow people to start riding the coaster right at that chunk.

Maybe I can 'disclaim' the chunk and either keep it wilderness or have it specially tagged by an admin so that can be *the* roller coaster chunk. But we'll have to figure out how to do that.

But anyway, it works! It takes 5 minutes and 40 seconds in real life to ride the entire coaster.

Jordis00fed did the portion in the Nether and it's pretty awesome. I'm really happy with it.

It has a vertical fall from like Y=222 all the way down to like Y=22 and thanks
to minecraft railcart physics, people don't die when they hit the tracks at the
bottom.
