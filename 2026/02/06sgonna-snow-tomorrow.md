The weather has been nice for the past few days but tomorrow it's apparently planning to take a turn for the snow right
when my barefoot grounding event starts.

I've asked for feedback regarding cancelling the event and no one has replied.

Kaz and Clare replied.  We decided to move it to next week which should be warmer, and happens to be Valentine's Day.
