Today it's 1° C and (lightly) snowing in my neighborhood.

I came to 新百合ヶ丘 area anyway to get a vegan lunch from Bio ç Bon.  On my way past HAC, I saw their shelves understocked...  Oh they're moving on Monday to a new location.  I bought two foot care creams for 20% off.

At Bio ç Bon, the cashier recognized me and got the vegan お弁当 I reserved this morning via phone. They had one other one on the shelf so I bought them both.

I also got 2 liters of oat milk, 2 hands of bananas, and 2 "loafs" of German bread, all total 4,850 yen.

Walking the 150 m back to my bicycle (where I always park near 7-Eleven), my toes got quite cold on the wet tile sidewalk, so I sat inside their seating area to eat one of my vegan lunches.

I felt kind of bad about bringing outside lunch inside to eat so I bought a hot lemon tea from the 7-Eleven.

I took a photo but I don't yet have internet access to post it.

Speaking of posting things,
I'm glad we postponed the barefoot grounding event until next week!
