"Today" I discovered that I can record things directly into Antigravity using the Gemini 3 Pro LLM, and I think I might be able to create journal entries using my voice this way.

In other news, I had a nice call with Jess, who has just arrived in London, and I was able to do two hours of work for my client AB.

Thanks to this recording, I can do things much more quickly, and I wonder if I will make new journal entries more consistently.

Wow, this recording thing worked incredibly well and seems like a game changer to me. I'm really grateful for all the technology that makes this possible.

Recently I've been doing a lot of different coding with different AI models, and while I haven't yet done programming with my voice, writing journal entries seems like a pretty natural thing to be done via voice.

It's about a million o'clock in my brain right now, so I'm quite tired, but this is incredibly exciting, and I'm really grateful and my mind is just reeling with the possibilities.

I'm going to go to sleep pretty soon, probably.
