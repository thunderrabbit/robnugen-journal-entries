"Today" I discovered that I can record things directly into Antigravity using the Gemini 3 Pro LLM, and I think I might be able to create journal entries using my voice this way.

In other news, I had a nice call with Jess, who has just arrived in London, and I was able to do two hours of work for my client AB.

Thanks to this recording, I can do things much more quickly, and I wonder if I will make new journal entries more consistently.
