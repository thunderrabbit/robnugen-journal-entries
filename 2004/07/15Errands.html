<p>I got two of three errands done today.  Easiest was paying my phone
bill: just take the bill to any (?) convenience store and they'll
accept the payment for no service fee.  Fast and easy.</p>

<p>Somewhat challenging was writing a signature to match my signature
at the bank.  I went to the bank and they showed me the signature they
have on file, but for some reason (number one suspected reason is that
I haven't written that signature but like five times in sixteen
months) I couldn't easily reproduce it.  It's my initial signature
written in a cramped small circle that is designed for a Japanese
hanko (stamp / seal) that people use instead of signatures.  I have a
hanko, thanks to Morita, one of my Nova students, but it's not
registered, and I've never gotten into the practice of using it.</p>

<p>After several back-and-forths by two bank employees, we got it all
sorted out and it was all good.</p>

<p>The third errand isn't yet complete.</p>

<p>Outside the bank, I had a feeling that I knew someone coming. I
looked up at Jackie about 10 meters away.  "Hi Jackie."</p>

<p>She looked at the postcard indicating my next errand and said,
"that's for your visa; you have to go to Yokohama to get it," and
suggested that it was easy to get there with the new train line (that
changed on 1 February).</p>

<p>I was like, "that's not where I went to get it," cause she had also
said I should go back to where I had requested the new visa, which I
don't exactly remember.  I know it was down on the Nambu line to
Noborito (I think) and then change to a different line and go south a
ways.  It was a bit of a hike.</p>

<p>"Okay, bye; good luck," etc and I was like <em>fuckit</em> and
went to the nearby police station to get directions.  Because Japan
is such a low crime country, the cops are often used to give
directions.</p>

<p>But, in this case, he was like, [I dunno; call the phone number on
the card,] after I had told him that I know very little Japanese when
he first started yammering when I showed him the card.</p>

<p>So I called the number and it was a difficult-to-hear recording in
Japanese that hung up on me after about 45 seconds.  No
English-option given.</p>

<p>I figured the post office should know where a particular address
is, so I went to see if my figuring was right.</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>But (and I still don't know how this could be helpful), because
the card indicated that I need to pay 4000 yen, the dude tried to
sell me a 4000 yen stamp.</p>

<p>Now.  I may be wrong in assuming that the stamp would not be
considered legal tender at the visa-pick-up-place, but it certainly
seems strange to consider paying for things with stamps.  Both the
post office and the visa place are government agencies,
but... governments print <em>money</em> for a reason: to make these
types of transactions easier to manage.</p>

<p>Now (2). If it's the case that this special stamp is *required*
for me to pick up the visa (which I would wager it's not, but with
Japanese beauracracy, it could be), it seems *doubly* strange that no
one until the post office guy told me of such requirements.</p>

<p>But that is too strange to imagine; cold cash will suffice, I'm
sure.</p>

<p><a href="/journal.pl?type=all&date=2006/09/01#Japanese_labor">Wrong.</a></p>

<p>In the end, the post office people were helpful;  they called the
number and determined the visa-office is on lunch break now; that's
why they didn't answer the phone before.  Fair enough.  I hope they
enjoyed their lunch.</p>
