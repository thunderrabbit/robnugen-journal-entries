<p class=date>12:30am Friday July 2 1987.</p>

<p>We mowed some today.  That's about all.  I wrote Robin, Emily, and
Stacey a letter.  I got a call from Kelly Fidler about Rifle Camp.
Our registration was lost.  She told me what to do and stuff.  She
asked me to tell Lynda.  I'll do that today as soon as I sleep first.
Cheri called today but did <em>not</em> want to talk long.  I
sincereley hope nothing is wrong.</p>
