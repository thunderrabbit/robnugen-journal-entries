<p class=date>7:25PM Friday July 2</p>

<p>Today I gave blood.  I called Cheri and Emily and they said they
weren't mad at me.  Cheri told me some stuff about how her life is
going.  we are about to go see some fireworks at Willowbrook.
Tomorrow I will get ready for Rifle Camp.  Today I bought white shorts
and put a note in Lynda's apartment telling her what Kelly told me.  I
Sent a letter to Stacy- Em & Cheri's friend.  Well We're leaving</p>

<p>Bye</p>
