<p>Rally tomorrow!  I am happy!  It's weird, I'm not totally excited
about it as the OKC Rally.  I know it will be at least as awesome
though.  I just finished getting ready for it.  I will wear 3
bracelets to school tomorrow.  I am going to wear Jams too.  People at
school have started wearing bracelets similar to the ones we made at
SWUUSI.  It's pretty cool.  I've got 2 small ones and One huge turkey.
I may buy two regular ones at school tomorrow.  It's Cheri's first
Rally tommorow.  I hope she has fun- She will I'm sure.  She's worried
though.  I can dig it, too.  I will be there if she needs it.
