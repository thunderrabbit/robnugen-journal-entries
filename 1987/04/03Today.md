<p class=date>April 3</p>

<p>1:20AM.  I finished 33 notecards out of 40 today.  I can do the
rest at school.  I wrote Lila a big long letter.  I did some extra
Spanish work.  I stayed after school and worked in Algebra and
Spanish.  I saw the Cougar Charms practice.  Mmm, Mmm. Sweet pussy!
1:22 - It looks like no one can read this now...</p>
