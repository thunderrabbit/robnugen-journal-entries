<p class=date>Friday</p>

<p>I wrote the last 4 pages of this big thing.  All the way back to
the marker on page 12.  I've been lying around all day.  Except when I
went to the Dr.  I have strep throat.  Since yesterday I've been
hurting.  Well, it's 3:17 P.M. on Friday and I caught up with my
life.</p>
