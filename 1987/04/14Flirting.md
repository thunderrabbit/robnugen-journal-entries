<p class=date>Tuesday.</p>

<p>I talked to Lynda Smith in the library a little.  She was looking
at some stuff about the different Astrological signs.  She said she
didn't know any Aires, and I corrected her.  We read about her sign,
Virgo, then mine.  We flirted the whole time.  Mom taught again in
history.  Candie Downy put her leg in my lap.  That was interesting.
After school, I caught up in typing.  I also watched the cheerleaders
practice.  I am almost glad I didn't make it.  They are doing some
tough stuff.  Christina was with me when I watched.  And every time I
smiled, she would ask me why.  The girl is paranoid.  I have got to
break up soon.  Dad had a good way to.  He told me to say she holds me
too tight.  I will do that.  After school, at about, 10:00 I printed
my research paper at Shirley Broussard's.  I got it done and I was
happy.</p>
