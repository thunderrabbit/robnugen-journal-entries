<p class=date>Thursday</p>

<p>forget yesterday, except Erin layed back on me on the bus.  I told
her about the rally.  I told her that I disobeyed a rule: that I
fucked Kelly.  I just wanted to.  Today I wrote a 5 page letter to
Kelly.  I'll send it tomorrow, along with the ring and bracelet.  No
school tomorrow.</p>
