<p>I been working out.  I've been using those hand squeezy things and
doin' push-ups.  I'm gonna get strong.  English - I have a rough draft
due Thurs.  I need to hurry on it.  Ma got a book about Challenger.
It will help.  I fixed up my Chemistry folder.  I need to prove
something in Algebra.  Somethin' about Hyperbolas, probably.  I can't
wait for OKC!!!! yeah!  I need to get Lean on Me recorded.  Guess
what!  the first tone of Lean on Me started on the radio when I wrote
the "L" of "Lean." 11:27pm</p>
