I'm going to quit writing down what I eat.  It takes up to much room
and doesn't do much good.  1st Period - I wrote an outline for my
research paper and I turned in a thesis statement.  Miss Carter wrote
it (thesis) though.  2nd we graded tests.  Donald Martin graded mine.
I got a 47 on it but he wrote it so it looked like a 97.  That's
pretty neat I think.  I just hope Mrs. Roach doesn't notice.  3rd- we
took a test.  We got back a previous test.  I got a 94 on the previous
one.  Also on the previous one I solved the bonus and <em>no one</em>
else did.  We had to show that the earth receives 1/(2 billionth) of
the sun's energy... given the radius of the earth and the radius of
earth's orbit.  Pretty good!  4th. We turned in our extra credit
stories.  I stayed up 'till 2:30 last... nevermind it's already
recorded up there.  5th Nothin' great 6th. Mr Reagh told us his theory
of how mathematics should be taught.  Kids should have no formal
schooling in math until 6th or 7th grade.  At that point they should
be given algebra.  Ultimately they would be 2 years ahead of
normal. 4:05</p>
