<p>I broke up with Christina.  She was all sad and everything.  She
said "It won't be the same." all the time.  I'm glad I did it, but I'm
sorry it hurt her.  I hope she gets over it soon.  I got a letter from
Kelly today.  It was short.  From what I read, she has a troubled
life.  Her parents are always after her, there's an abundance of cuss
words in it,... etc.  I'm really sorry about that.  Yesterday Dave
came over.  He had literally fought/wrestled with Woody.  I told him
that he shouldn't live like that, and should seek help.  I hope he
thinks about it.  I went my letter to Kelly today.  It was 5 pages
long.  I sent her ring and bracelet too.  her bracelet smelled great
while I had it.  Dad got my slides back from the rally.  I will
<b>never</b> use fucking slides again.  Only for like scenery and
shit.  Not people.  It just doesn't work.  Night Night. 11:55</p>
