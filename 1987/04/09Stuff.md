<p>I want to try to remember to write my dreams down to-morrow.  I'm
goin' OKC!  Yeah baby!  WhooHooo!  Alright!  I can't wait.  I want to
get Boom Boom, and Lean on Me, and Little Red Corvette, and Sex
Appeal.  Those are some good songs, man.  Tomorrow I will miss 6th
pd.  No problem, though, I will just miss the test.  I can make it up
Monday.  Today on the way home from school, I sat lengthwise on the
seat with one leg up and the other on the floor.  Erin laid back on
me.  Very comfortable.  I sorta held her ass up close to me the whole
time.  I'm sorry I will miss her party tomorrow.  Well, byebye.
