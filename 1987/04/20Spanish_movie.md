<p>In Spanish, Rob and Neil had Dean film them in Safeway.  It was
hilarious.  In one part, they walked right up to the camera, and then
the scene changed to them walking away from it.  They were stopped by
a freezer, and pulled ice cream, oreo's, peanut butter, and stuff out
of there.  And Rob was by the beer shelves and said
abra-cadabra. Instantly, a case of beer appeared in each hand.  As
they were leaving, they had a giant cartful.  Neil said "you want all
this?" Rob said "Nah." so they turned around.  The End.  I guess you
had to be there.  10:20</p>
