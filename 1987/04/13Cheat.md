<p class=note>(transcribed 6:40pm CST Saturday 25 January 2003)</p>

<p>On Monday the 13th I went to school.  Ma was my substitute teacher
in History.  That didn't keep me from cheating on a test, though.  We
did a dumb lab in Chemistry.  I got a 92 on a test in there.  4th pd
We worked on our plays. 5th I accomplished nothing.  I will stay after
on Tuesday with Christina to type.  We learned some new stuff in Alg.
After-school I typed the main section of my English paper in.  I
found out that there is no Houston rally (the one Kelly is going to).
I took my pictures in to be developed.</p>
