<p>I just wrote 2 letters.  To Christy and Erika.  I just got one from
Lila.  You know what?  Lila is awesome!  I love her personality and
she's into guys and sex and she gives good back massages... Wow!  And
I'm gonna get her at OKC.  I can't believe she's 15 though.  I would
swear she's older than me.  goodnight. 10:28</p>
