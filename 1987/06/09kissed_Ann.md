<p>Sunday.  Church.  I drove.  Mom and Dad were not there.  Me,
Jenny, Cheri, Emily.  We talked about how we are going to decorate our
room.  We had some good ideas run around.  Tuesday I went to the mall.
I cashed a $70 check.  I went to Willowbrook.  I bought 3 posters 2
for church 1 for dad.  I bought a Kermit the Frog and Tootsie Rabbit.
I got Marble Madness.  I will probably return that though.  It
stinks.  I bought some junk from <em>of all things</em> that turned
out to be shit. (not really) I won't buy anything but posters from
there again.  Maybe not even that. (posters) I came back with less than
$1-pretty good for me- MONDAY I went looking for a job-Kroger,
Walmart.  Tuesday I applied at Klein's. I hope to get a job at
Klein's.  Tuesday we had rifle practice It was OK.  I really Love it
though.  I went to Lynda's to "practice" after that.  Bull shit- I
went swimming then watched part of Running Scared.  Ann was with me
all the time.  :-) Wednesday I didn't do much until evening.  I went
to Terra's (sp) house.  Tera (sp) Brooks.  Ann was there.  Along with
her sister, Karen.  Erin, Terra's sister was there.  She is about 6.
Terra and Erin get along pretty well.  That is neat.  Tera is pretty.
Erin is cute.  Afterward, Ann went with me to my van to talk.  She
kept apologizing because she was in a bad mood.  I didn't & don't see
why.  She claimed I didn't have fun, but I did.  That was about
10:30. She asked me when my curfew was.  I said 12.  She asked if I
wanted to go to Lynda's.  Darn Right I want to go to Lynda's.  Anyday.
Anytime.  We went.  <em>Time Bandits</em> was on.  When I first got
there I sat in front of Lynda, who gave me a massage.  Ann sat in
front of me.  I gave Ann a massage.  Then Lynda had to go get some
medicine for her momma.  So it was just me and Ann.  We moved to a
wall that I could lean against.  She lay back on me.  Similar to how
Christy did.  We kissed a little, but not much.  I left at about 12.
Ann didn't get up for me or anything.  So I am still wondering about
exactly how our relationship is.  Ya know- does she care?  or will she
ever?  Did she ever? Or-Does she act like that with everyone?  I'll
maybe ask Lynda.  I got home at 12:15, and everybody was snoozin'.  I
start writing this entry.  I fell asleep.  I woke up and started on
the line with the smile on it on the other page with "Wednesday."  Dad
just called to get me up and going.  He asked how I was and how my date
was.  He thinks I went to see "The Untouchables" ha!ha!  Well bye
