<p>I'm on page 888, now.  It's Sunday June 21, 1987 5:25PM.  Yesterday
I went to Marie Dickerson's party.  It was OK. The height of the
excitement was shotgunning Pepsis.  But if you call it a party, it was
my first.  I'm really just not too social.  Maybe being in band will
change all that for the better.  Today we fixed up our room at church.
Fred is not a NUT.  I hate it.  He better Keep cool for a while.  Mila
and Kelly were there.  They went to the service to watch their dad,
though.  Afterward we brought them up to see our room.  It looks
pretty cool.  It's got a Spud's poster, 2 of Garfield, a lot of
pillows, and other great stuff.  Well that's all.  I check you later.
I can't wait till <b>S W U U S I !</b> Bye Bye Sunday June 21 1987
(Father's Day)</p>
