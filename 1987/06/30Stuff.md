<p class=date><em>3:25AM</em> Tuesday June 30, 87.</p>

<p>Monday I went to Kroger to ask about my job.  They said they would
call me.  Then I mailed Emily's letter.  Then I went out to look for
red electrical tape.  I need it for rifle practice in 15 hours.  We
are going to tape our rifles so they look about the same.  I hope I
can find the crap.  I didn't yesterday.  Well that's all</p>
