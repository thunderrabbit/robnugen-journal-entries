<p class=date>11:55PM Wednesday June 24 1987.  Same day</p>

<p>I am in the process of writing to Christi.  I'm on page 5.  About
fucking long.  I got a call from Kroger today.  I may be able to get a
job there.  They will call me Friday to tell me yes or no.  I will be
a stocker.  I think I will like that better than being a sacker.  Get
to use my muscles more.  Well bye.  11:59PM June 24</p>
