<p>I didn't do anything yesterday.  Except send Christi and Cheri and
Emily their letters.  And we went to see Innerspace.  Fred won tickets
through KKBQ.  We went to the Galleria to see it.  Today I worked
outside some.  I cleaned the kitchen.  I practiced rifle.  I got a
letter from Balderdash.  I wrote her back.  Will send tomorrow Good
Night</p>
