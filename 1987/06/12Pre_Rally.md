<p>Yesterday I didn't do much.  I talked on the phone a lot. Cheri
twice.  She said she talks to me more than anyone else on the phone.
that makes me feel pretty good.  Also we both have gotten to be better
friends.  We were cutting eachother down & saying "You know I Love
you."  So we are best friends-set for life.  I tried to call Ann a few
times but I never got her.  Today- RALLY!!!! Houston Rally today!!!!!
Bryn is going!  I just go a letter from her.  And one from Misha!
Cool!  I started getting ready for the Rally today.  I bought some
shorts and shirts and socks.  I am making a big nasty kite.  It's
about 8 feet tall.  Lemme check... 8ft 2in X 6ft 8in wide.  Big
Sucker.  Well I gotta get ready.  I'm going to drive down and pick Dad
up at his office.  I'll write about the Rally after the Rally Bye</p>
