<p class=date>Friday 1:40AM.  June 19, 1987.</p>

<p>I don't remember much from Yesterday or Wednesday.  Just that I
went on a letter writing spree.  I caught up when I finished Robin's,
Aaron's, Amanda's and Cheri's today.  I have also been reading
<b>It</b> I'm on page 449.  I need to practice rifle.  Bye.</p>
