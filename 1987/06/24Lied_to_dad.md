<p>Monday I didn't do much.  Tuesday I saw Predator.  It was good.  I
told dad I was going to rifle practice.  I knew we had no practice.
So I went to the Mall.  I saw some cool video games.  One about a
skateboard dude.  And one new car game, OutRun.  It was cool.  If you
wreck, you wreck and you can see the car tumble.  And the steering
wheel literally shakes.  Then I saw Predator.  In the movie there was
an excellent gun.  It was a gatlin'/machine gun.  It fired about 50
rounds per second.  It spun so fast that it was just a whine sound.
It could mow down trees like nuthin'.  It was bad.  When I got home,
dad said, "How was practice?"  I said OK.  He said "Well I got a
letter that said you don't have one today.  Did you go to practice?"
"No" "What did you do?"  "I saw Predator" "Well you should have come
back home" "OK, sorry, dad" No problem getting out of that.  But I was
lucky that he said he knew there was no practice.  Today I started to
fill in some of the holes in our road.  I also tried to fly my little
kite.  Fred and I were going to go swimming, but we aren't.  I wrote
to Cheri and Emily today.  I got a letter from Christi.  It was 8
fucking pages long. Not including the "Well, bye bye" page.  Wowzers!
I am about to go work on the holes more.  Then I will write to
Christi.  I want to stay up late tonight.  Bye. 6:00</p>
