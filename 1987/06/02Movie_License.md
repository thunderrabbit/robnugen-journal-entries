<p>Yesterday The rifle corps "practiced" from 1 to 3 PM.  Then I went
home.  But not after planning to go to a movie with Anne and Lynda.
Anne picked me up at 6:40.  We went to pick up Lynada [sic] and her
date, who unfortunately wasn't me.  We went to Lowe's and saw Secret
of My Success.  It was pretty good.  During the whole thing Anne and I
were holding eachother.  It was nice, but nothing spectacular.  On the
way home, Anne dropped Lynda off at Richard's house.  I hope she had
fun.  Then Anne took me home.  We didn't kiss or nothing so I guess it
will be at least a while before I can get her.  Today I woke up early,
and got my license.  I'm legal now.  Yea!  The test was incredibly
easy.  I lost 10 points.  30 was the limit.  There was a very pretty
girl in front of us in line.  Kelly Potter.  Kiss Kiss I wish.  I
could snag her if I had more time.  Well that's all.  Bye Bye</p>
