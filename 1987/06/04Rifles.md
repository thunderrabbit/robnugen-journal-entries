<p>Tuesday The Rifle corps practiced.  It was tough.  I LOVE IT!  I
will be so strong while I'm on the rifle line.  After practice, I went
to Lynda's to swim.  Ann was there.  We practiced on rifles for a
little then we swam.  Scott Smith and some dude with a wide head was
there.  Ann was hanging on me the whole time nearly.  I made a pretty
good impression on everyone there.  Near the end I was just hugging
Ann close to me to keep her warm.  She seemed very secure.  That's a
good sign.  Wednesday I practiced with my rifle for a while. Then Dave
came over and we went to see Nikki, who is in the hospital with
arthritis in her right arm.  Then I practiced some more with I got
home.  Today, I practiced some and smacked the top of my hand so I
quit for now.  I will go out again later. Tomorrow I won't practice
much at all.  Maybe none to give my arms a rest.  I can warm up before
practice Saturday.  Now I am waiting for a return phone call from Dr
Nair's office.  I might be able to get a job there- typing in stuff on
their computer.  That will be cool.  Well that's about all.  ByeBye.
