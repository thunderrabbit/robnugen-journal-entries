<p>We had no meeting yesterday.  It will be Tuesday.  I need to
practice rifles more than I have been.  I need to bring a poster on
something for the NUTS Room.  Spuds Mackenzie probably.  I want a
whole lot of pillows for that room.  It will be great. Bryn wrote me a
letter, but it was very short and she didn't put our usual pictures at
the end.  I'm finding it hard to write back properly.  OH Well.  Good
night.  I want Lucid Dreams 10:35</p>
