<p class=note>[I can still remember to this day (my 12,000th!) as we
were in Mr Reagh's Algebra II class (I remember it was Mr Reagh's
room, but I wouldn't have remembered the subject without reading my
diary), near the end of the day, announcements were made that anyone
who wanted to try out for marching band should go to the band room
that afternoon right after school. After a bit of discussion with
Heather Lakatos and maybe Derrick Whitte, Christi Bradley turned
around in her desk, looked deeply into my soul with her beautiful blue
eyes and said, "you should join band."</p>

<p class=note>Me, like a deer in headlights: "okay."]</p>

<p>Christi Bradley got me to try out for rifles today, and I made it.
OH Shit.  That will be a lot of work.  But I'm in band, now, and I'm
near Lynda Smith.  She's in rifles, too.  Sex Sex Sex.  I will get to
go to 6-flags if I keep it up.  I will have to practice every fucking
day, though.  Goodnight 10:22</p>
