<p>We did it.  We did a movie about RAMBO.  Robert Astle was Rambo.  I
was the chief bad guy.  Neil and Dean were my helpers.  Mary Beth was
Ramba.  Tammie Pekar was another damsel in distress.  OK the base
plot: Mary B and Tammie were with Rambo.  He left for a second and the
bad guys grabbed the girls.  Rambo came back and found out.  He went
after the bad guys.  They were in their hide out playing cards.  I
came in and shot the girls. (they were in there) We played cards and
then Saw Rambo.  As we ran out I dumped over the card table, hard.
Next scene - Rambo comes up to the bad guys.  I come flying in doing a
flip off a trampoline onto the ground.  We all fight and I get out of
the scene.  The 2 guys get Rambo down.  Ramba comes in and knocks them
out 1 punch each.  She carried Rambo off.  She came back and killed
the 2 bad guys and they fell in a pool.  In the last scene I was
Rambo/Ramba's servant.  It was cool.  I hope Mrs. Sherman likes it.
