<p>Mrs. Sherman liked the movie.  I finished my Algebra II final
except for the parabola.  Rob and Neil stayed up all night working.
Literally. They slept all day until 6th period (Algebra) when they
came to school.  Tomorrow I have a meeting to go to for rifles.  We
will get measured for our outfits.  I talked to Heather Lakatos some
in Algebra today. I also gave her a shoulder/back massage.  She said
she liked it. I hope she will let me give her more.  Today in
gymnastics, I did 2 flyaways.  On my next try, I hit the bar with my
foot.  It hurts a little Still.  The NUTS get to have our own room in
church.  That will be great.  Though it has no windows.  We will paint
some maybe.  I can't wait.  Well, Goodnight 11:00. PM</p>
