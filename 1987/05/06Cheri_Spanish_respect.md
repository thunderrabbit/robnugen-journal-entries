<p>I wrote to Cheri.  I told her she was hard to flirt with.  I wonder
if I should send it.  I wonder how she'll take it.  Me, Rob Astle,
Neil Henthorne, & Dean Chandler may make a movie for Spanish extra
credit.  That would be awesome.  I've got to really prove myself here
to get some respect from them.  Well, that's all.  Good
Night. 11:45</p>
