<p>I don't know why I woke up early.  I got a letter from Shay
Pickerell yesterday.  It was short but nice.  She hasn't been to
church since I met her at the OKC Rally.  Kelly has not written to me
yet.  I will write to her and give her the details on the Houston
Rally.  Church today will be fun. We are having a pic-nic.  I hope we
can grab that room.  I will bring my Spuds Mackenzie poster for it.
We will need to put a bulliten board in there and a whole bunch of
pillows.  A stero is needed, too.  Well, that's about all.  Good
Morning 6:50AM</p>
