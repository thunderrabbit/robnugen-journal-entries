<h1>Most Illinest, Illinest, Illinest Me</h1>

<p class=date>9:50 PM May 27, 1987 Wednesday</p>

<p>Finals start tomorrow.  I have not studied worth shit.  Literally
less than an hour collectively for all my classes.  I think I may
die.  Cheri called today.  That did little good for my studying.
Lynda came up to me in the hall today.  That means she notices
me. Good.  Sex appeal.  Bryn wrote to me.  At the end she drew a
little sign that said "Bryn +" Then she wrote fill in the blank.  I'll
put "Robert =" and write fill in the blank.  Give her the hard stuff.
Make her confess.  She's only a Freshman.  Gee whiz.</p>

<p>God, I feel so dumb for not studying.  FUCK the World!!
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SHIT!!!  I will
not cheat, though.  Good Night.  Wait!  I got an 80 on my English
paper.  Remember?  The one on the Shuttle.  I got a 79 on the main
part of the Alg II final.  I will bring that up, though.  Good Night
now. 10:00.00 PM</p>
