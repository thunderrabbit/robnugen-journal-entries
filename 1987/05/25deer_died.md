<p>Today was interesting.  I chipped my tooth in typing.  At home I
had some stuff happen too.  I called Lynda Smith.  We talked about
nothing for a while.  Then I went outside to practice my rifle.  When
I was out there, 3 deer ran by.  Then I heard a loud wailing that
sounded like a sheep.  I ran to it and it was a deer that was being
attacked by 2 dogs.  I ran them off and tried to calm the deer down.
Fred called Stan. We brought the deer back to the house in a
wheel-barrow.  We had it wrapped in a sleeping bag to keep it warm.
When Stan got there, though, it had died.  He autopsied it as hit by a
car to break its leg, then caught by the dogs.  We buried it.  Dad and
mom got rid of the Audi today.  They came home in a new truck.  I have
yet to see it in the light.  Friday Dave will drive us to and from
school.  Dad won't let me drive Thursday.  Oh Well.  Good night.
