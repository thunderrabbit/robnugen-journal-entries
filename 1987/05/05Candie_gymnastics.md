<p>Candie Downy knows the dude who recorded "I be Elliot" for 93Q.  I
may have a chance to meet the dude.  He is totally cool and a real
good friend from what I have heard from Candie.  I'm thinking about
quitting gymnastics.  I don't have the interest like I used to.  Bryan
said if I quit, he would too.  I wonder how bad that would be for Jim?
