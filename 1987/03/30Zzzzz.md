<p>I had fish and potatoes and milk and angelfood cake, whipped cream,
strawberries.  Amanda called along with her friend Margaret?. We
talked for a little bit.  I told Amanda to write me a letter and to
get me a picture of Rachel, Amanda, and Margaret.  I want to go to
Astroworld!  The Cyclone has been "fixed up." I don't know what they
could do.  I've heard they put new cars on.  I need to get my license
soon.  I want to drive some to the OKC Rally! That will be fun!  Well
good night.  Lucid dreams beckon.</p>
