<p class=date>March 29, 1987</p>

<p>I started this diary.  I wrote a lot!  This morning I had my first
semi-lucid dream, a start. It was in a grocery store.  I was trying to
get somewhere and Lynda Smith was in my way.  I was going to go around
her then I woke up a little.  I realized it was a dream and started
major flirting with her.  I eventually woke up all the way.  I took a
shower, went to church.  Only me, Emily, Cheri, Jenny and Andy were
there.  Emily was totally hyper.  I drew a picture of a lake with
hills behind it, trees and bluebonnets around it, mountains behind the
hills, and a river, and clouds.  It is to be given to a visitor from
another country coming to the IARF conference (International
Association of Religious Freedom).  I slept on the way home and just
wrote in here for the rest of the day.  It's 11:00PM.  I think I'll
sign off and start a new page tomorrow.  I hope to have a lucid
dream.  Starting tomorrow I'm going to write down all my meals and
start keeping track of my health- look for patterns.  Well, good
night.  Happy Dreams!</p>
