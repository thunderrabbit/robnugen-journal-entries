<p class=date>March 30</p>

<p>No lucid dreams.  It's 5:50AM.  I dreamt that I was at a store
looking for Jams. Danny Dillard showed up and thought that was funny.
Next thing I know, I'm sitting with my back against a wall and a wall
is on my left.  There are some girls on my right against the wall.  In
front of me is an open area, maybe a store or a cafeteria.  Terra
Suter crawled into my lap and I had my arm around her and held her
other hand.  She turned into Vanessa Payne and started arguing with
the girl on my right.  I think <em>she</em> was Vanessa Payne too.
Wierd!  6:10</p>
