<p class=date>3:50P.M.</p>

<p>I had 2 bowls of Crispix for breakfast.  For lunch, I had a roll,
tea, and pizza and veggie sticks.  For a snack I had a piece of cake,
milk, slice of meat, and graham crackers.  1st pd.  Library.  I worked
on my paper more. 2nd I failed a test.  I have about a 50 in there.
3rd. We found out what is on our test tomorrow.  4th Oral grades.  I
got 18 out of 20. 5th Some jobs and a Timed Writing  6th.  Went over
test I got a progress report.  Today I found out that Christina's mom
is mad at her because we've only "been out" twice.  I swear her mom is
dumber than Christina.  It used to be that we were getting too
serious. What does she want??? Yesterday Christina gave me a matching
pen and pencil. They are nice, but the pen writes blue and the
pencil's lead is too big.  Today she gave me a list of 200 song
titles.  I don't know why.  I gave Charmain her "Beastie Boys" tape
back.  I borrowed it to copy it, but I didn't copy it. 4:15PM</p>
